But it's great to hear that Changelly has that option since I've been using it to exchange fellow coins. It's kinda same as to what [alternative IEO](https://blockonomi.com/standard-tokenization-protocol/amp/)'s are doing as it has the same goal for traders to buy low and sell high, no one wants to lose money anyway so systems like these where it protects our crypto are really helpful.

The crypto is not actually ‘on’ the trezor. It’s just a device that allows you to access it. The coins never leave the blockchain.,"Seeds created by your hardware wallet (both Trezor with optional 25th word and Ledger) and  are generally BIP39 seeds.  You can restore this via a program like Electrum.  The irony here is that once you restore the seed to an internet-connected machine, there's a risk of compromising the wallet altogether no matter how small.  So to test the restore method, create a new disposable wallet with a new seed, send a very small amount of Bitcoin to this, then attempt to restore the test wallet via Electrum (download only from [electrum.org](https://electrum.org) and nowhere else, and spend time learning how to verify the downloaded package's GPG signature).  If it works out, the procedure to restore your main intended hardware wallet is the same.

I'm not familiar with how Bitcoin ATMs work, but I suppose that the ATM gives you a new private key with each purchase, with your Bitcoin arriving there shortly.  If this is the case, simply import or sweep the private key into a wallet app or program of your choice, and send all the BTC to one of your hardware wallet's addresses at the earliest convenience.

Hardware wallets give you peace of mind in that no one knows the mnemonic words except for yourself.  The risk here of course, is that you'd better find a way to keep those words physically safe.  This means considering fire, flood, earthquakes, local disasters, and external events (invasion / city breakdown) as well.  You'd also probably want to own multiple hardware wallets set up with the same mnemonic words, to serve as hardware backups, and keep them in different locations, while still having them within reasonable reach so that you can update their firmwares when necessary.  Some people, aside from having physical copies, keep their mnemonic words split between different keepass or encrypted online archives, different cloud services, further obscured in many different ways (file and extension renaming, assigned with 20+ character word passwords, stuffed into an online folder full of many DOCX, XLSX, picture, or video files).  These all depend on how far your paranoia will take you.  Some others totally do not condone any form of online storage for mnemonic words.","There is also the well-known Ian Coleman seed conversion tool in case of need, I've never used it but I know it can be used offline too and is useful as a last resort, when you cannot import seed or keys in other wallets. There are many articles online that talk about it, it's good to know that it exists even if you hope you never need it :)"

Cryptocurrency,"Cryptocurrency is lots and lots of cool math ([SHA-256](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SHA-256)), and lots of computers which all know every time someone sent money to someone else since 2009 (the entire ""chain"" of ""blocks"" aka the ""blockchain""). All of the computers are all doing the really hard math, which makes it very hard for any of them to lie about something that happened in the past. To do that, they'd have to do the math faster than everyone else combined ([51% Attack](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/51-attack.asp)). This makes tracking payments really secure. Nobody knows who you are, and nobody can shut it down because the information is all on a lot of people's computers everywhere.","Sending files to people on the internet these days is very easy but you can't send money because you can't have a situation where money is copied from one person to another like you do with files. By creating a permanent history of all transactions between users on a cryptocurrency's ""network"" that is shared by all members supporting the network you can trust that this never happens. In the past, we had to trust a central authority like a bank to make sure nobody was copying or ""counterfeiting"" money, but now you can trust an entire network of people made up of anyone all over the world instead. Since no one person or company controls the network of say, Bitcoin, so you don't have to worry about many of the pitfalls of modern banks. Cryptocurrency puts the power back in hands of the people and takes it away from power hungry centralized institutions who exist only to profit off of the people who use them by whatever means possible.","Cryptocurrencies are currencies where unlike traditional currencies like the Dollar or the Pound, transactions are not validated and monitored by a central institution (e.g. a central bank). Instead, all transactions are recorded in a public ledger, called a blockchain. If someone makes a payment, transferring some Bitcoin, for example to a vendor selling a good, a record of that transaction will go into a pool of unconfirmed transactions. People called 'miners' will then collect group some of these transactions into a block, and solve a complex mathematical problem to validate this block of transactions, after which, this block can be added to the 'blockchain' - the entire chain of blocks of transactions (since 2009 for Bitcoin). This is a very secure payment system, due to the fact that no single entity has control over the blockchain, so no one can exert control over the verification process for their own gain (e.g. through double spending)."

Perhaps by then projects like **Blocknet**, and **Komodo** will see some **major** exposure and popularity among the crypto communities.

For the Chinese economy.,"I hate to be a hater, but I can’t see this really going through. There is no way, given Xi’s authoritarian streak, that they will fund anything that decentralizes power. They might get a pseudo-blockchain, digital version of Yuan which makes it easier to control, but there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the amount of relative decentralizing influence a crypto network gives to its participants, and the heavily authoritarian policies of Xi and the Party.
My theory is that China failed to ban bitcoin because too many of their well-connected elites were buying into it to preserve their money, because they saw currency controls forcing devaluation of yuan.

Market trends, decides which coins move. As we saw XLM increase by more than 20% when they burned half their supply,

there’s systemic issues with the global financial system. There’s a possibility of a lot of wealth moving into crypto’s.


Even if you lose every dollar it’s a risk worth taking at this stage.","My advice is to not take financial advice from anyone. How angry would you get if the market went opposite way of the advice given? For example, if the expert told you to hold but it tanks even lower or if you sell and it goes to the moon. If you're willing to fully accept that the expert you listened to was wrong, you have no one else to blame but yourself.",Just hold. It will eventually go through ath but who knows when. Might take years.

1) Bitcoin surpasses it's old ATH, and gets media attention all over the world (Like we saw in 2017). At which point people will FOMO in again, considering everyone in this world is greedy, and greed definitely controls us.   
2) Exchanges will be FLOODED with signups, from which point most people will be FORCED to use Decentralized Exchanges to get in their favorite projects.   
3) The majority of people will realize they can't afford much BTC, so they'll speculate on altcoins, shaking up the market again. 

4) DEX's will get a new flood of liquidity we haven't seen before, and those wise enough to accumulate DEX orientated projects like Blocknet, Komodo And other DEX's will make a great deal of profits from trading fees.   
I see the argument that ""DEX's is shit, no volume"" - Well, have you considered we're in a bear market, and most people don't care about trading crypto right now? In fact, most are holding..   


Exciting, I'm accumulating like a mad man at these crazy low prices. What about you guys?",

Perhaps give them the same treatment on your taxes as you would gambling losses? It may or may not be necessary to actually forfeit them, if you consider them lost, and are not able to access them, then they are lost.

If you want to CYA, I would suggest that you contact KuCoin and let them know, you are writing the tokens off as a loss and consider them forfeit. They may not be willing to respond without engaging you further for KYC, but at least you can record that you have made the statement, and remember that in the future in case it should become important.

I am not a lawyer and doubt very much that you will get advice from one here, but from what research I could do, I was only able to find tax code wisdom about ""seized and forfeit"" property, which is a designation that you can use on your taxes for property that is no longer accessible because it was used illegally, eg. under the status of civil forfeiture.

On the other hand, ""gambling losses"" are tax deductible up to the extent of your winnings, so you might consider to approach the question that way. If you declare these as a loss, and at some point their value should increase, I would guess that you might decide to approach KuCoin differently at some future date, assuming they are in fact reputable, and perform the KYC. If you forfeit the money, but didn't do any KYC, I would assume that as a reputable company they will have maintained your account in standing (that being, regardless of any unauthenticated communications which you may have sent.)

At that point you might even reclaim the crypto funds as ""found money"" and treat them as income with a cost basis of $0 (eg. pay the full income tax marginal rate for your bracket, to be able to safely enter them on your capital gains worksheet in the following year.)  Assuming they moon, and your $10 in shitcoins actually are worth something – I wouldn't assume that, since you say they are forfeit, but I also once upon a time bought RedHat stock at the IPO price, and later sold the shares for a nominal value in order to pay some bullshit ETrade exchange desk fees. ***groan*** *\*scam\**

Again I am not a lawyer or a tax advisor but I have been able to trade cryptos for several years, and pay my taxes on them without attracting any negative attention or special guidance letters from the IRS.",,

Unless WAVES has changed a lot in the last year, they offer a very easy way to create and distribute your own token, but that's been used so much that anyone holding a WAVES balance has hundreds of worthless tokens.

Most other platforms are going to require you to have at least some development experience to work with, I'd advise familiarising yourself with the documentation for your chosen blockchain and working on learning that first. Distributing a token is one thing, writing a new wallet app is another. I've got about 5 years of development experience and had a go at writing a wallet once, it's no quick process and I ended up going back to my other side projects.

If you're trying to avoid transaction fees in the main currency, you're going to be better off creating a new blockchain and forking the code from one that's already similarly structured to what you're after.",Why not eth?,it will be good if you find someone who already experience to create their own crypto

Soon, you'll be able to Cross Chain Stake XSN, and recieve whatever coin you want (supported by the network), which is pretty cool, more over Stakenet invented cold staking (Trustless Proof Of Stake).

A few days ago they also collected 20k worth of tokens together with Huobi for Project hope to fight the Covid19 virus.

Very transparant too. We basically get spoiled monthly with livestreams from the CEO itself updating the community on the progress they have made. Doesn't happen very often at all in crypto space.

Installed the network using the scripts to run 4 nodes, installed the node js applications, one for the AVA wallet, and one for the faucet!

All installed and running, I was able to get testnet tokens in the wallets and send tokens from a wallet to the other!

Now I'd like to run the network and the validator nodes using the command line, so to run how many nodes I want.

The $6800-$7300 range has been prime trading space. Longing all dips and shorting the tops when the pull backs start to occur.  


REMEMBER, [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)takes the stairs up and the elevator down. It is unusual to see hourly negative trends even if the daily trends are obvious. Currently we have [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)having pumped in correlation with equity markets. I think the stock market is over bought and a fall out is imminent. People cant pay rent, they shouldn't be buying stocks. People haven't worked in months, they likely won't be buying stocks or [BTC ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/).  


Brings me to my main point. SHORT. You can trade these swings all day and night as long as we stay in this $6800-$7300 (even $7500) range. However, as the longer term timeframe shows we are [bearish](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bearish/) . [Bearish](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/bearish/) while the economy is getting rekt.

Well written up. But there's one thing I disagree about the stop loss. 

Stop loss should be used to limit your loss, not to be placed right before liquidation.

Everyone should have a plan, e.g for this trade, I'm only willing so lose up to 5%, 10%, 15% 20% of my capital. 

You don't try to go all or nothing in 1 trade.",What about fees? I hear that on Kraken you get charged a fee every 4hours for a long or short position. Is that true and how do other exchanges approach this?,Good advice.  Any other information would be appreciated

We understand that the Web Traffic Factory is not the be-all and end-all metric. 

Take note that the Web Traffic Factor is just one of the many metrics we are releasing. We're also releasing a new algorithm that takes into account all the data (liquidity score, web traffic factor, order book depths, and time & sales) to determine which volumes reported by exchanges are inflated and to what extent.

We recommend to read our latest blog post about all the upcoming changes: [https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/13/ongoing-improvements-to-combat-volume-inflation/](https://blog.coinmarketcap.com/2020/05/13/ongoing-improvements-to-combat-volume-inflation/)

I have tried every setup imaginable. Tried most mining programs from xmr-stak to xmrrig to claymore etc. i started with MinerGate like the article talked about. Dont use them simply because when I did it took FOREVER just get to the minimum withdrawal amount. Up to you though because it is super easy to setup. I also have used CUDO miner. Same thing as MinerGate except you can tweak it way more but the withdrawal limits are a hassle. Right now I have been mining Conceal (CCX) for a while. Super easy to mine especially if you download the BlocGui miner. Bloc miner is AMAZING! Super easy to setup and has multicoin functionality. Stick to mining cryptonight coins as they are the easiest for your setup. Use cryptunit.com to calculate your most profitable coin to mine. Good luck and have fun. Yes its tru it is not profitable but this is absolutely one of the best ways to learn about crypto and have fun!,

There's nothing novel here except quantum resistance.  Does it have transaction fees?  ASIC resistance is a pipe dream, and mere mention brings a very bad impression as per many other projects in the past.  Arguably it may even be better if the team doesn't mention that.

But crypto is not a proven long term store of value.

We can argue about the definition of store of value but I assume in this context here that it's long term.  And It's ridiculous to say that it is a good store of value long term here's why. 
Bitcoin (not other crypto currency by the way) has had somewhat of a volatile start with the massive highs and lows. Technically it's only been able to prove it is somewhat of a store of value for exactly 11 years, 6 months and 9 days. 
With each passing day it proves itself more and more but there is actually no substitute for time. And time is the magical equation in the discussion of stores of value. 
When you say store of value you need to specify the period of time otherwise it's assumed to mean a long time in a discussion such as this. And what if when you need to sell it, to tap into right now, today that 20k you thought you were ""storing""  you find out your 20k is now actually 10k because you bought at the 2017 high. That is not a store of value friend.

OK well let's change the argument. You need to store $100 for 72 hours for a friend. Do you store it in Bitcoin or fiat? I think we know the answer. 

It's hard to even compare Bitcoin to other things. Gold has been a store of value for 5000 years, proven, property like land, art, jewelry and government bonds can prove their value store capabilities in the long term much easier in fact. 
Some will say that, well next to fiat it holds its value. Yeah OK, but you only have 11 years to compare. We know fiat buys much less today than it did in say the seventies right. But Bitcoin wasn't around then so you can't compare. They are not mutually exclusive you can have both of them be bad stores of value. I'm not saying Bitcoin is a bad store of value, I'm saying its impossible to argue that it is a good store of value long term because it's so new. Again I'll repeat there is no substitute for time in the definition. If you bought Bitcoin at its high, your actually still in the red three years on per my earlier example and yes those folks are out there, they exist, try telling them it's a great store of value. I mean Apple stock has a better store as compared to Bitcoin, provable 40 years. If your going to compare speculatives let's compare. 

Bitcoin store of value also depends on the literal storing of it. Is it durable, accessible? How are you protected, how does the network maintain that, what if there is no power, no internet, zombie apocalypse, nuclear war? What if you wake up one day in the middle of Papua New Guinea, you think the fuzzy wuzzy tribes care you have a million dollars worth of Bitcoin to trade them for not eating you? You need a phone or laptop and you need to get to the city to charge your phone, but even then they need one too to transact with you, but of course you could just sell your Bitcoin convert it to the local currency the Kina, but how do you do that is there platform for that, do you have enough time, enough battery power, reliable internet? You'd struggle. Half the world has zero Internet, many parts still don't have reliable electricity. But if you pulled out an ounce of gold they know exactly what it is and one of their tribal elders will likely know the spot price. I don't want to get into a debate but I just think that it's not been tested in the long term. Give it another 88 and a half years and then we will actually know whether or not crypto is actually a good store of value in the long term (our lifetimes) or not. And even if you can make the argument that it is, well when you need to utilise that store of value you better hope and pray that the amount you need is still stored in there and that it's not lost its value.","Bitcoin for payments?

When you open google and search for XMR wallet there is an ad on the Google search engine from Google adsense which leads you to [xmrwallet.org](http://xmrwallet.org/) instead of [xmrwallet.com](http://xmrwallet.com/). 

The funny thing about that is that it shows on the google ad ""[xmrwallet.com](http://xmrwallet.com/)"" but when you click it it redirects you to ""[xmrwallet.org](http://xmrwallet.org/)"".

So how does this scam work?  

It's a perfect mirror of XMRwallet.com with one little modification. No matter which seed you use to login it will always show the same XMR receiving address. The address of the scammer. 

Note: They also added a little download GOI wallet windows button which downloads software that might be adware or even spyware i don't know. ","Luckily I saw this post, currently my dad and I have been researching different cryptocurrencies and had most considered XMR(Monero).

Infura is a centralized data protocol, which if it goes down (has happened before), makes all the ETH tokens unuseable, which would be a disaster for a project like LINK, which relies on the ETH chain with it's nodes.  


Blocknet is the only project working on a decentralized data protocol, which can handle ETH's data, the interesting part is the fees involved, which is shared among the nodes running these services. Infura collects millions of dollars in fees every year, so a fraction of those fees paid to node holders would mean incredibly high ROI for node owners.  


Decentralization means that the single point of failure - Infura wont be an issue for token holders anymore. This is pretty interesting in terms of a business aspect, where node owners will take the fees, and not a centralized entity like Infura.  


Blocknet is mostly known for their DEX, but they are much more than that, and this recent DEFI craze will for sure put Blocknet up to par with top delivering projects in this space, since their tech has been built on for years already.  


You might wonder why this isn't a top 100 project yet, if what they are building is this significant, but they don't deal much with marketing yet, but rather focuses their time and energy on their tech.  


Blocknet's tech could be incorporated straight into Metamask, giving it's users a decentralized, AND cheaper solution.  


This is one of the very few projects I could see 100x, let alone 500x since it's marketcap is so incredibly low, and since this project isn't a new ""churn and burn"" project, you **know** they deliver.",,

“IOTA has great partnerships, it must signify something, doesn’t it”

**IoTeX Blockchain: Interview to Simone Romano**

* IoTeX declares itself as a new DLT dedicated to the IoT world. Can you explain the basic operation without going too far into the details?

* How is the development of IoTeX organized? And where do you find the informations?

* With respect to well-tested technologies such as IOTA, can you tell IoTeX pros and cons?

* Can you make a comparison?

* Don’t you think that, at least in terms of scalability, IOTA is more performing than IoTeX?

In a continuous effort to be transparent and create a healthy community, KardiaChain Foundation is pleased to announce that we reached a settlement to buy back 650 million KAI, equivalent to 80% of the total private allocation pool, from a number of private investors.
Image for post
We will proceed to lock the whole amount immediately into the Foundation Reserve allocation. It’s noteworthy that Foundation Reserve tokens are locked for 12 months and vested over 24 months. The pool is used for reinvesting in advanced technologies and pushing blockchain mass adoption.
The 650 million “bought & locked” KAI accounts for 13% of the total supply or roughly 40% of circulating supply and will offer incredible value to both our community of KAI holders and the development model of the project itself. By reinvesting revenue into the project, we are ensuring stability for years to come. Besides, we are well equipped for expanding our reach into the other ASEAN markets in the future.
We hope this provides our community with a clearer understanding of the foundation commitment to them and the goal of blockchain mass adoption.","The link is here for further reading:

'Sato, a lawmaker from Florida, had co-sponsored the Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020, the Act itself seeking to harmonize national regulations when it comes to exchanges.'"," 

This bill aims to amend the US legislation when it regards to electronic signatures in commerce. *The plan is to extend this applicability to* ***electronic signatures, records, or smart contracts stored, created, or otherwise secured both on or through the use of a blockchain***\*\*.\*\* Furthermore, the bill aims to *provide a* ***uniform national standard*** in regard to the *validity, legal effect, as well as the enforceability of these signatures, records, and contracts, as well as for other purposes*.

This bill stands as the **US’s latest efforts to try and regulate the** ***digital currency industry***, while the industry itself continues to gain mainstream adoption as it grows. Back in September, two new bills were introduced to the House of Representatives. The first bill sought to make the **US Securities and Exchange Commission (**[**SEC**](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/john-mcafee-sent-to-court-by-sec-over-ico-promotion)**)** the authority to determine whether or not a digital currency is a security. The second bill allowed the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission (**[**CFTC**](https://insidebitcoins.com/news/cftc-charges-crypto-futures-provider-for-violating-registration-requirements)) to gain regulatory power when it concerns [digital currency exchanges](https://insidebitcoins.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges).

One of the central figures in the **US’s push for crypto regulation** is Darren Sato. Sato, a lawmaker from Florida, had co-sponsored the **Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2020**, the Act itself seeking to harmonize national regulations when it comes to exchanges. Furthermore, Sato stands as a co-chair of ***Blockchain Caucus***, which stands as a ***bipartisan Congressional group that has continuously worked towards laying down the regulatory groundwork for blockchain adoption***.",,

I do recommend to read their EULA first thought just to be sure (It's an awful read but you can never be too sure).
One good side from Uphold that I should mention is their 0% trading / withdrawal fee on the new version of the site, It's easy to use for a beginner.","Yeah they’re legit it’s your bank giving you the hassle because the funds are being sent outside the US.

idk about Edge cause I use Blender Wallet right now.

One thing I can tell for sure Coinomi is complicated for me. And I need mixer for private transactions.","HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallets enabled a breakthrough in backing up the wallets by allowing a single seed to derive all private keys and address, so backing up a single seed was enough. Further developments allowed a single master seed to derive all other seeds for all other coins as well. This is the approach used by Coinomi and most other wallets, including hardware wallets. A single seed backs up everything.

If Edge has a different approach where each coin has it's own seed, it's also a valid one, but may not appropriate for wallets that don't support multiple recovery phrases. Due to hardware constraints, most hardware wallets only support having a single phrase set up at a time. At the very least, it will be extremely inconvenient to have to enter a different phrase for each and every coin you want to use on the hardware wallet.",

It has a lot of similarities to Swirld's Hashgraph, so much so the chief architect Art Brock made a [medium post](https://medium.com/holochain/hashgraph-vs-holochain-eb38d7dc1f8a) comparing the two. The selling point for HOT is that holochain might just be the best solution for creating decentralized, scalable, applications and if that takes off maybe their cloud hosting will too.

Excitement is in the air, prices recently hit all-time highs and our latest Kraken VIP sentiment survey reflects the many ways professionals are thinking about how the cryptocurrency sector might evolve in the year ahead. 

In the new survey, Kraken VIPs – a diverse mix of brokers, custodians, family offices, hedge funds, market makers, miners and traders – share their insight into the state of the market heading into 2021 for any investor seeking an edge.

Indeed, while prominent funds and investors like Michael Saylor and Paul Tudor Jones have made bullish bets on bitcoin in recent months, that’s not all that is exciting our VIPs.

By downloading Kraken Intelligence’s latest report, you’ll gain insights into their preferred price targets, investment convictions and general sentiment on the state of the market.

We explore:

* **Diversifying**  – Polkadot, Chainlink and Monero led the charge after Ethereum as the most popular alternative cryptocurrencies. Our VIP’s commonly cited community strength as an important factor when deciding to buy and hold these altcoins.
* **Optimism Ahead** – Institutional adoption is driving bullish sentiment. Nearly 70% of our respondents believe we are now in a bull market and believe that innovation, improvements and positive regulation will boost their investments in 2021.
* **Price Targets** – Our VIPs offered bullish forecasts for bitcoin and ethereum in 2021, with high-end estimates for their price appreciations topping $250,000 and $15,010, respectively. Respondents are optimistic that next year both cryptocurrencies will provide at least 175% returns from October prices.
* **The DeFi Space** – The popularity of Ethereum, Polkadot and Chainlink reflected the rise of DeFi. Our respondents are investing in the belief that decentralized finance and reimagined financial products may disrupt traditional industry. DeFi is also being credited for the increased adoption of stablecoins.

If thats your savings, you should go with safe bets like BTC or ETH. If thats money that you are fine with just ""throwing"", you could try altcoins too. I read here someone recommended 50% BTC, 40% ETH, 10% altcoins. I myself have 80% ETH, 20% altcoins. 

However, ive been trying to also draw parallels between current investors and 2017/2018 investors. Altho marketcap has grown more, it seems like most investors are only focused on BTC. There has been a lot of talk about BTC being the virtual gold, and i think thats an understatement. Gold today is not used as a currency but rather as an asset. As of today, cryptos are both currency and asset. However, I dont see future btc as a main currency, i think something better will come along (if it hasnt already).","I think if this is your concern, just hold a 70-80% dominance in BTC and ETH (or similar level), then smaller holdings in one or two solid established alts. Then 5-10% or so for the fun moonshots.


In fact, some investing approaches see value in a small holding of risky, high reward assets. 


But based on how you're talking here, I would make sure you are disciplined in terms of what % of your portfolio that is, and stick to it - to avoid that 'greed' as you said. I would also say, with the smaller cap alts - set a target profit point and start selling once they've mooned (if they do), at least a portion. Most these coins are not long term holds, but something with quick value that should then be converted into btc/eth or cashed out as profit.


Just my opinion of course, but hopefully a couple of things which could help. Setting rules and being disciplined is the best approach, if you don't have a plan you will have an even higher level of risk than the already volatile market."

&#x200B;

You have fallen into the hype.

Doge was created as a JOKE crypto. Look into its history.

  
You SHOULD be investing in BTC as a noobie or even ETH to start.

&#x200B;

Doge is  

**$0.0271** **(-44.89%)** 

It was a pump and dump.

Its not in the top 10 anymore and again, -44 percent!  
Now XRP is the new thing thats being hyped and you can rest assured in a few days, the crash IS coming....

&#x200B;

You are wrong and foolish and are FOMOing in.  
You should have sold when it was at 7 cents.","Idk, I'm quite skeptical even after Flare's collab was announced. Mainly because DOGE is already within the top 10 or so, and imo it hasn't got any intrinsical value that can make it go bigger significantly to make it worth the risk. Conclusion: I'd much rather invest in innovations like NANO, SOL, EGLD. Which, being not in the top 20, can go up quite a bit more and even get into it.

But everyone does with their money as they see fit, and many people enjoy pure speculation above everything and being bandwagons. That's perfectly valid, and as shown in recent times, could be quite profitable given the right circumstances.

Discalimer: I may be wrong about DOGE, I haven't really delved deep into it, just know it is based on LTC. So if I missed anything pls point it out.",You are late man.

You will lose some money (maybe all of it).
Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.

Find an exchange and fund it.

Find a wallet that you like. (not your keys, not your crypto)

Learn about and understand what you are investing in.  
If you can't explain it to grandma, don't buy it.

Some things are already expensive. (like bitcoin)  
For these types you are best to watch for the dips and invest over time.  Lookup DCA.  Investing in bitcoin is a less risky and therefore less rewarding venture.  

For big gains you need to get in early with something that has real world utility. Many of us are XRP fans for this reason. 
For the same reasons I skipped the Dogecoin pumping as of late and although I missed the opportunity I'm confident the whole space is gonna get exciting in the next 6mos to a year.

Diversify - buy more than one type of crypto in the event that one goes down, the other may go up.  

Don't chase the hot items, pick what you believe in and wait patiently for the ride to start.

Learn how to read the charts - they're like a map to the treasure

Strengthen your hands, don't let a price drop shake you out or scare you into selling.  These drops are better viewed as crypto going on sale - buy more and reduce your cost per coin.

Keep good records - tax time comes up fast - why get rich if the government is going to come take it away?

If all coins are going up maybe ask yourself, why? If it seems that coin may continue to rise proceed with caution. If the coin looks like a pump and dump, stand clear.

If all coins are going down maybe ask yourself, why? If it seems that coin may continue to go down as it has been for an extended period of time proceed with caution and ask yourself, is the tech good? Are there people selling off to get in at a lower price.

If the coin looks like a dump, stand clear but again look at the project and ask subreddit lots of questions. 

DCAing is always good to do with coins you believe have good tech but are dropping in price.

TLDR; Proceed with caution always and dont go chasing quick (within 6 months 1000%) gains. Don't just jump in without a weeks hard research. Looking forward to seeing more posts and questions from you."

He said it during his first ever live stream on Clubhouse tonight. It was scheduled for 10pm PST. 

Incase anyone is unclear... it was not intended as a low blow to Doge by Elon Musk when he said “... fate loves and often, the most ironic outcome is most likely, or I like to say the most entertaining outcome is often most likely. Arguably, the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future.”

He is saying the irony is that Doge was created as a joke toward cryptocurrency, yet here we are changing the world into cryptocurrency because of it. Irony is when a situation is opposite of what is expected, and sometimes it is strangely amusing or so incredible that it is nearly unbelievable. Example: A fire station burns down. Fire stations shouldn’t burn down, just like joke cryptocoins shouldn’t become the cryptocurrency of the world. What Elon is saying is that the most unlikely thing to happen... usually is the very thing that does! So where does fate fit in? A few ways...

Fate meaning something that will inevitably happen; Fate is thought to determine the outcome of a situation, most times catching us by surprise usually because of the odds of it happening. Fate such as the hedge funds being overthrown by those who don’t agree only a select few be allowed to hoard huge profits. Or cryptocurrency taking down the dollar. Or decentralizing banking systems, controlled finances and centralized authority.

“Fate loves Irony” meaning fate and irony when presented together will combine the most unforeseen and unbelievable outcome. Decentralization & Cryptocurrency is our fate, the irony is that it will be accomplished through Dogecoin which was intentionally created to make fun of these concepts. Elon Musk is promoting Doge when he says “Fate loves irony...” he mentions he also use to make jokes about Bitcoin. Musk can also be quoted saying, “Who controls the memes, controls the Universe.”
https://twitter.com/btcization/status/1356126052326592514?s=21

Our fate is in our hands... literally! The irony is it’s with a cryptocoin that shouldn’t have value and now does. Put it together and shoot for the moon... it’s what Elon would do! But just a word to the wise...

“Fate loves Irony... but hates hypocrisy.”  So don’t become the people we are trying to overthrow and evolve from.

It's when Bitcoin undergoes a growth spurt and all the shitcoin creators rub their hands in anticipation of all the n00bs arriving who they can bilk.

So they rush onto forums to pump their garbage... which n00bs will exchange their bitcoin for. That pushes up the price of the shitcoin... at which point the shitcoiner/trader converts their shitcoin token into bitcoin and the price of the shitcoin drops back down. The n00b is left holding the bag and feeling stupid. 

In effect they transferred some of your BTC to themselves and are sitting there laughing at you.

It happens every... single.. time that altseason comes around.

Then of course, when anyone points out that this is immoral scummy behaviour, people will a) vote it down b) tell you how much they made off ""altcoins"".

Unfortunately for you, there isn't going to be a simple answer to your question and anyone who says otherwise is probably just trying to shill you into their personal beliefs. The crypto space can get pretty complex when you get into the nitty gritty stuff, it also doesn't help that there are thousands of different coins out there and that the space is evolving constantly at a very rapid rate. 

My suggestion to you is to start from the bottom and work your way up. Do you understand what distributed ledger means? Do you understand what blockchain means? Do you understand the difference between a private blockchain and a public cryptocurrency? Do you understand what cryptocurrencies are trying to achieve? Look into the history of bitcoin, the very first cryptocurrency and try to see what Nakamoto's vision was. 

Once you've gone through that, look into Ethereum, the very first Decentralized application platform; a revolution in the crypto world just as important as bitcoin is. Try to understand what Dapps are, how they differ in their utility to bitcoin and what the potential for them is. Try to envision how crypto enthusiasts want to build this gigantic ecosystem sustained on a decentralized network. 

Although there are many cryptocurrencies out there, they all pretty much follow the same tenets as bitcoin and ethereum. They all have the same goal in mind but have different ways of achieving it. Look into the blockchain Trilemma. How does a blockchain provide Decentralization? How decentralized is it exactly? How does it ensure that the ecosystem remains secure? Does it use Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, or something else? How does it achieve throughput and how does it scale in order for millions of transactions to travel at reasonable speeds? 

Once you understand these questions (and many more) and can apply them to individual cryptocurrencies you might be able to see the differences and can decide for yourself which coin to buy.","Well, that's a good question but difficult to answer... For me it took about 7 to 8 monts to understand what blockchain is, what type of crypto's there are and why they could have value or not. So I would give you the advice to do a lot of research to understand the basics. 

Some projects have value because they already are big platforms and already players for years in the crypto markets (like BTC and ETH). Some projects have a big developer comunity to solve economic or financial problems (like DOT, Link, ETH or Stellar). Some projects are working in various markets like supply chain, micro payments or privacy (like OriginTrail, Kin, Ark, Data). You can invest some money by learning and reading about projects and make your own descision. You also can just 'do what otter people do' but that's more like a casino where you can play poker or some roulette.. It's up to you, but in my opinion it's better to start with investing some time in learning before investing your hard earned cash.. 

To get an idea, take a look at the Blockchain Landscape:

For the choice of wallet, I'll recommend one like the SYLO smart wallet, it's more than just a wallet because it has some other features embedded in it like a Decentralized messaging option to communicate and interact with others, it also has payment options.



DOT is a strong project to equally invest in, another project built on DOT is XED it's one with much potentials and adding it to your portfolio won't be a bad idea.

I bought BTC at 10k a few months ago, then when it was approaching 30k I set a sell order a few grand above, thikning that it might touch it and then drop back down so I could rebuy and build my BTC.   Its never gone back down since then.  

I shoud've known better, I lost most my funds in 2017 trying to hit trades like these and it never worked out.  

But at least I took a little profit. I have some ETH and a handful of other alts that I'm happy with and I will be holding those, especially the ETH.","I have been into Crypto since the last bull run 2017/2018 and only once owned a small amount of Bitcoin I got around the 10k mark. Sold it for a small profit. 

I don't own any BTC now but bought Eth at $150 which has been great for me. Currently in the green despite holding bags of alt coins from 3 years ago. 

I think I'd still be in a similar position had I bought BTC instead of Eth. The market tends to move together most of the time and if some don't move together they tend to catch up later on that's why it's better to hold rather than time the market. Most of the time people jump on the coin that's already increased/ increasing.","This is not the way! Btc, eth, link"

If they don't end up delivering on their promises and you've bought during the hype train, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose your hard-earned dollars.  

Then again, if they do end up delivering, the price might just head toward a planet or two and you might just get rich off it.

Your basis of choosing this Radix solely lies on atomic composibility and Eth 2.0 not having it. You claim it will ""break Defi"".

Do you think that the Ethereum community, which has been in the blockchain space for 10 years working relentlessly and have planned Eth 2.0 upgrade, have not thought about it if its that obvious? If it is so vital are you saying that they want to ""break DeFi"" which has been build on Eth 1.0 and destroy whatever they have build in the last 10 years? 

I am sorry but by your claims, you are basically calling the experienced Ethereum developing community stupid. You are pitting your claims against basically the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance here which consists of people who are arguably among the smartest on the planet, so you might wanna think this through.

The project itself is solid just that it's yet to get that attention it deserves which makes it one that still very much undervalued. 

The new features that was added to the Smart wallet, like adding Bond token, improving the UI, adding the in-app Crypto buy feature and many other features to be added soon sure did play a good part in the steady rise in price it experienced within the last one month. The future looks promising for the project.","It's nice that people put in time and give us a summary of a project - from their own perspective. I was also into Sylo, their whole decentralization story gave me superpower :D, but then they kinda lost touch with community and I really hope they will get back to us, since we need them, and they need us to be a success !

I would give Sylo a good brainstorming session on how to raise popularity and usability of one app that holds many dApps inside.

1st they need an ambassador, with a good name, that many people follow and go to see their hints on projects  
2nd Sylo could do a gains contest, screenshot your best trade - ROI :D  
3rd update their medium page is a must IMO  
4th i don't know how, but improve customer relation services - since the community is still here, make em feel good at least.  
5th they have a great case to build on (from fat protocols, nodes and so on), find the right team if the current one isn't working

It is conceptualized out of an improvement over ETH ( ETH can be considered as a second place mover to market). As far as code goes, Cardano is not a polished version of the same source that built ETH, but it is a fundamentally different code structure and language from ETH, that performs similar functions in a more diverse, efficient, and scaleable way. Quantifying that is difficult for me, but that's the language in the community.

Cardano team still has to work through ancillary first-mover development challenges, though they do not appear to be paramount to the foundations that Cardano has been built on and most have a schedule for completion. Part of the adoption curve is that Cardano is actively building bridge systems to allow projects to migrate from ETH to benefit from a range of more friendly features. Project tokens will be native and treated as first class citizens. Transactions per second are  higher based on code other than sharding the actual ledger but in a second layer (Hydra), and fee/gas structures are notably different. This is getting a lot of critical attention lately for ETH becoming proportionally expensive to process smaller transactions, where ADA is relatively fixed and reliable creating a more equitable and predictable transaction relationship.

Next phase of development is called Goguen phase and is focused on Dapp development in the community, exciting stuff: [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/)

Here is more overview info: [https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/)

Hope this helps, I am rather new in this community as well however I'm soaking it up and challenging myself to participate.","Eventually all worthwhile block chains will be able to interoperate with each other. So at that point the advantages come from the governance system and the scalability. Eth is currently undergoing its migration to eth2, which will address these. Cardano has been a work in progress for the last 5+ years building these from the ground up. Here in about 2 weeks the Mary fork will put ada on a comparable playing field as ether, with the exception of the current development ecosystem. However ada is much cheaper to transact on, so it will catch up in no time flat. Ada and eth will both be used in the future, but to me Cardano will be the superior project.","Cardano has an ERC20 converter coming next month.
It has POS and is the most dentralised, so either coins move over to Cardano or someone else will take their spot and build on the Cardano blockchain.
It is over.  I know this will hurt the feelings of ETH holders but we are all trying to make the world better so please do not let stubborness deny you opportunity."

1. Binance Launchpad

The pioneering IEO platform started operation in 2017 and became mainstream in 2019. A lot of successful cases including Bread, Gifto, Bittorent, Celer, Fetch

2. Huobi Prime

Huobi was actually the next major exchange after Binance which managed to perform successful IEO with the TOP Network project. They completed their first selective token sale event in a matter of seconds, with token prices surging by 250% immediately afterwards.

3. OKEx Jumpsmart

As one of the leading exchanges by trade volume, it’s no surprise that OKEx doesn’t want to be left out of the IEO trend. To ensure that they stay relevant, they’ve announced their own IEO platform, called OK Jumpsmart. So far there isn’t any public information about upcoming projects, but we can be sure that they are looking closely for new prospective projects to work with.

4. Coineal Launchpad

Coineal is quite a big exchange with almost $700M daily trading volume and they’ve already jumped on the IEO train with their own Launchpad. Among already completed cases they have IPW Token, Levolution, and Kizuna Global Token."

The only problem is their customer support is horrible, and if things do go wrong, you'll be playing a long waiting game with no responses for a while. Think automated replies, and silence. But since you're looking for something easy, I've personally never ran into issues with Coinbase and it's about as straight forward as it gets.

But since we're dealing with real money and real consequences, it's very important she becomes properly educated. If she is unwilling to do this, then it can lead to disastrous outcomes.

It's a very wise idea to transfer the cryptocurrency from the exchange, such as Coinbase, to her own private wallet. An example is Exodus or Atomic. These are the more friendly wallets, but she will have to learn how to transfer coins to them.

But in any event, the most important thing is safety. Never store passphrases (the passwords that get you access to your wallet) digitally. Never take a screenshot of it, or otherwise store a copy on the phone or computer. Paper copies of the passwords, stored in a secure place (or a safety deposit box at the bank), are wise ideas.

If she ever requires customer support, she needs to never, ever, type her passphrases into any website, or ever give it out to any person under any circumstances. If it's ever asked for in any way, shape, or form, it's anyways 100% time a scam. The criminals in this sphere can be sophisticated with great English and great knowledge.

There's fake wallets on Google Play, and malicious websites with fake wallets that duplicate the real wallet's design. She should always verify and make sure she's dealing with official sources.

Edit: And if she does use Exodus or Atomic, uninstall the program after using it. Then reinstall it when you need access. To keep track of her portfolio, she can use an app like Blockfolio for her phone.",I suggest Coinsloot. Itd be the most fun shes had and she will learn the ins and outs of crypto very fast.

3/8/2021,t3_m0ytbm,8,/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/m0ytbm/what_will_the_downturn_look_like/,1,CryptoCurrencies,What will the downturn look like?,"Crypto currencies are a highly volatile asset class. Volatility means that it cuts both ways too, big upswings and down swings. If you are genuinely worried about month to month fluctuations of the fiat value of your position, that means one of two things. 1) You don't understand the project you are investing in well-enough and/or 2) You've invested more money than you can afford to lose.

&#x200B;

There are going to be huge swings both ways in the future as this technology reaches wider adoption, if you can stomach it - I think its a wonderful 'moonshot' investment that can be included alongside a broader balanced portfolio.","There will most certainly be an altcoin slaughter. My prediction is that this time it will be worse than 2018-2019. In the last bear market ALTS dropped 90% for the good ones, 98% for the okay ones and a lot just out right died (exit scam, cease development, etc). This time, as of this writing, because alts have not appreciated much during this bull run - of they drop even 60% or 70% they will put in lower lows than they did from 2018.

For me personally, I will be flushing out all ALTS the when BTC drops through the 20w MA at the latest. I have a strategy to DCA out of all my ALTS if we have a blow off top mania. I will out them into a stablecoin or USD and wait for the market to determine the low, those will be reinvested into BTC. 

I think this bear market could go 1 or 2 ways. Either we mimic something like 2012-2013 bull run where we shoot up very quickly, as we just did, then we return to the 20w MA and the coast a long there for a while and shoot up again or second, we fall all the way back down to the 200w MA for BTC (alts  will do significantly worse). Do note, we hardly have any support zones because we went up so fast, so the drop, I expect, will be just as fast. It will certainly shake out a lot of weak hands.

Those that are saying 'institutional money won't let the market drop that much' they are day dreaming. Like the S&P500, the drop will be sudden and fast. It will be a shake out, panic sell, suicide hotlines, etc but it will recover quickly and start to head up for a 2023 market top, in my opinion.",Dont be scared about the 🌈🐻 1btc will always be worth 1 btc.

Shadows Network (DOWS) has joined the Web3 Foundation and has received a development grant. W3F is committed to funding research and development work into creating the decentralized web and is at the heart of Polkadot. Shadows Network is building a synthetic assets market on Polkadot that draws upon the network’s scalable and interoperable capabilities. 

https://shadowsnetwork.medium.com/shadows-network-joins-the-web3-foundation-and-receives-w3f-grant-4cc26e244f75

The Shadows platform sits on the Polkadot network as a parallel thread. As such, it has inter-chain compatibility with other platforms leveraging EOS and Ethereum to focus on synthetic assets. Cross-chain support opens the network to more blockchain-based assets. For instance, users can use Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin (BTC) to create synths.

3/13/2021,t3_m4jux7,7,/r/CryptoCurrencies/comments/m4jux7/crypto_understanding/,3,CryptoCurrencies,crypto understanding,"1. Don't expect rationality in the crypto space. For a community dominated by ""more-rational-than-thou"" technologists, it's much more emotional than anything else. Why is BTC dominating LTC? Because people like it. That's what it boils down to.
2. To an extent that's already happening (the state of New York has been very aggressive in regulating crypto exchanges, for instance), although I imagine most people in government don't care. Right now crypto is a speculative asset for nerds who like to gamble. There's no real risk that crypto will become a large enough part of the economy that it will challenge federal control of the monetary supply. 
3. Of course governments can tax crypto - that's what being a citizen in a country is all about. The government used to tax gold and crops, it's not like if it's not fiat money they throw up their hands and say ""oh no, our nefarious plot has been foiled! Curses."" The process is very simple: if they decide they want to tax crypto and know you have it, you will get a letter saying: ""we are taxing this crypto, gives us this amount or we will charge you with tax evasion."" This is probably a good thing, since living in an Ayn Rand novel would be a fuxxing nightmare. 
4. Yes, they could, and I suspect that may be the inevitable end game. Most people won't care as long as it's easy and they can buy stuff with it. The vast majority people don't care to understand the technical details of blockchain systems and the mathematics underlying cryptocurrencies. 
5. No idea on this one. I don't get it either, but I suspect that most of it is ultimately a shell game people with MBAs are playing hoping to get something for nothing. 
6. Again, most people don't care for libertarian pipe-dreams and would rather have an easy-to-use currency that can seamlessly integrate into their lives, rather than wrestling with a complicated system. Regardless of what crypto is ""supposed"" to be, it will be whatever most people want it to, which if it's anything, will probably look more like MasterCard and Bank of America than some kind of cypherpunk fantasy.","I have a question to add: is there a reason people aren't worried about countries like China having such a large stake in cryptos that they could essentially crash the market if they all pulled out at once?

I like their spirit and strategy to first building great stuff and innovation and selling it afterwards when it's good enough for mass adoption. And I would say it's time soon. Looking forward to 2021.","Nano I don't know anything about. Nimiq - i think they have a hard working dedicated team that's making a product with limited use. Their big selling point is that anyone can buy crypto from a browser, not through an exchange. That's all well and good, makes it easier, but who's going to use it? Young people already into crypto are just fine with exchanges it's better even because then they can throw a hundred bucks at their favorite shitcoin. Older people, boomers, aren't going to use it Bitcoin isn't really usable to them just an investment novelty if at all. So who's left, a small segment in the middle, and is using an exchange really that troublesome? I think long term there could be adoption and it will have some success, but not a lot.","Nimiq will bring a completely innovative technology with OASIS, the first non custodial fiat/crypto bridge that we can consider the natural evolution of crypto/crypto atomic swaps.

I would not be surprised to see this technology implemented on decentralized exchanges, I have read that eFIN is already working on this.

Furthermore, with Nimiq 2.0 there will be the transition to proof of stake and to the new emission curve chosen by the community months ago ... it will reduce annual inflation from 29% to 4%.

Nimiq is definitely very cheap now considering all these interesting news in the medium to long term."

A few months ago I heard about ADApay and bought ~5,300 Coti tokens for about $1,000 after thoroughly jumping aboard the hype train, but the Coti wallet isnt available in the US and I couldnt find any wallets that support their native tokens. 

So I sent all of them through the official Coti->ERC-20 bridge, the transaction was confirmed but apparently they got ""stuck"" and the mainnet address I sent them to never spit them out into my Trust wallet address. (https://explorer.coti.io/df7b22d0cb8f7c7bd20dd9ccc277aad7f9ebdf384c8825d408f27f6efba3afb3) 

Ive been talking with Cotis support team about getting them out (they admit they are stuck there) but its been slow moving. They shut the entire bridge down after I told them what happened lol. Those coins are now worth about $2500 and Im sweating a little bit over it as its been a full 8 weeks and they only reply once every 2 or 3 weeks if im lucky.",COTI is not really a scam but a joke.,

Well BTC is over a trillion in market cap, and it doesn't ""make"" anything at all. In fact, it's consuming more power than many countries.

An item's value is purely what others are willing to pay for it. Their reason to pay could be due to actual service/benefit, or it could be speculation that it's value will increase, or it could be something else.  

Crypto isn't like stocks because you don't get dividends, you don't get any kind of ownership in the company or people behind it. It's a lot more like money. 

> If VET hit the same market cap as bitcoin...

Bitcoin is extremely well-known in the world, much more than Ethereum, and not many people have heard of anything else (except maybe doge). So I wouldn't make investments based on ""well, when it becomes the same as bitcoin...""

However, I _do_ use similar logic when I consider new coins. Instead of bitcoin, I look at more established coins that have very similar technology. E.g. say there's a new coin ASDF that is an NFT platform. If I think it will really take off, then I'll look at other NFT platforms such as OMI which is at 1.5bn market cap. So I think ""ok, if it does well then it could hit 1.5bn. It's currently at 200m, so that's a ~7.5x growth potential."" So, similar to your thoughts, but instead of comparing with BTC I find a closer comparison.",,

Before the research, I would open an account with a good exchange (you can find all kinds of videos and articles about which ones to avoid) buy a bit of BTC and ETH (They are the 2 biggest and 'most stable') and hold it. Dollar cost averaging and hodling aren't sexy but they are the best plan. To that end, get a wallet and make a few small transfers. Its best to not leave your crypto on the exchange. Transfers are one of the scariest parts about crypto. One bad letter and you can lose it all. So make a small transfer first to make sure it goes through before you move a large amount. (Also, when you start expanding your portfolio, make sure you have enough of the appropriate coin to pay the transfer fees. For instance, ERC-20 tokens need ETH to pay the fees. I only mention it because I made that mistake early on) Then after you get used to that, get used to the idea that 5-20% moves are not uncommon, so you could lose a bunch of value overnight. If that happens with one of your large cap coins like BTC or ETH, just breathe in and not freak out and panic sell, you'll get it back again before to long. Smaller coins, might be a different story so that's why I say stick to the top 10 market cap coins until you start too feel comfortable taking risks (speaking of, I think Dogecoin might be up there in the top 10 at the moment, I'd recommend you stay away from that one until you understand the market better.)

As for the research, like he said, white papers are the best thing but I'll be honest, they aren't fun reading. I listen to several podcasts and watch a bunch of YouTube videos and read articles. Coinbureau is a pretty good youtube channel for getting a taste of a lot of different projects and alt coins but there are a lot of others. If you are really serious there are a lot of programs to teach you how to trade (ie technical analysis etc) as well. 

Just take your time and don't let FOMO get the better of you. I've made pretty good returns over the last year but it's almost entirely on the back of buying some ETH around $200 and hodling. Almost all the speculating I've done has lost me money in the long run. Just take your time and have a plan.","Don't listen to me bc I do almost zero research ok? But I've been collecting all the cryptos available on Coinbase. There are 52, I have 14 already. Every single one of them is UP by ""a percentage"" I buy on the dip, that way all it has to do is come back to where it was and you profited. I also buy crypto with low price hoping it will explode one day. 

I JUST started like 5 days ago, I'm up almost 100.

This is my new pet project! Good luck!"

They go hand in hand, Investing is the attempt to predict a future outcome, and receive a reward for it. The question is what is value and how can I predict what will be of value. The tech is directly tied to the value of the token in the long run. Valueless coins will be worthless after the bill market is cooled. Tokens like eth though with real utility will have intrinsic value which makes it a good long term investment with great potential for profit. When I enter positions I look for long term tech value, and oversized returns vs risk. Then just pull the trigger and if the facts say go, then put your money where your mouth is.

That said, the time will inevitably come when governments and banks will actually adjust to crypto, accept it and integrate it into the current societal/financial structure. Then the mania phase will begin and we'll all experience the *greatest* but also *last* bull run. Prices will start stabilizing. 

It will be exactly after that when all shitcoins along with weaker projects that will disappear in a matter of days. Adoption will gradually begin and people who are still invested in doge and other get rich-quick coins will have massive losses. 

Until then, take care of yourself, be wise instead of greedy and understand that crypto is not about making money but making the world better by taking the power in our hands, instead of giving it to banks and governments.",,

[Telegram channel](https://t.me/traderino) \- Here you can see what the bot is doing. It's pretty chill at the moment as things can take a while to heat up. What usually happens is that there will be times where he starts opening a lot of positions very quickly, since cryptos are highly correlated and usually drop/rise together.

[Strategy explanation](https://ailef.tech/2021/05/20/im-building-a-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-that-you-can-follow-live-on-telegram/) \- A blog post explaining the strategy in more detail, with also screenshots from the bot if you don't wanna jump on Telegram","Kudos to you for building your strategy with one of the most ""back-to-front"" languages out there - PineScript, you get an instant thumbs up from me just for getting through that mess.

I'd suggest cross-referencing with a Linear Regression Channel so that the channel's Pearson Correlation Coefficient can get checked first, if the R value is greater than 0.75, the indication provided by the SuperTrend line is bound to be pretty on-point.

In either case, well done and good work.","This is dope. Is the bot public? Can we use it?

The argument isn't that cryptocurrencies are the **only** way to launder money, just that they make the process easier.  Attacking banks because they are _also_ used to launder money is just [a tu quoque fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque).

To attack this argument, you either need to go at it directly, and point out things like due to the public nature of the blockchain, it's actually _easier_ to trace funds on a cryptocurrency like bitcoin than a traditional bank, where you need to work with private companies in potentially a large number of jurisdictions, some of whom won't want to work with you.

If you're a fan of privacy tokens, then you just need to acknowledge that money laundering will be a thing, but point out that personal privacy might be a larger concern, and illegal use might just be a necessary evil, like it is with cash.","Nothing new here.

Most people are just searching for yield and looking for a quick buck, they don't care about finance, they don't care about the tech. 

I think the real trend is that the internet and social media has turned investing into something more akin to pyramid schemes.  Social media influencers hold more power in the markets than Warren Buffet or CNBC. People shill their bags, coordinate pumps, and dump on their followers. It's all about how viral something can become rather than some fundamental thesis.

People getting into finance is not new. Ask your grandparents, they loved gold just as much, if not more than we love our bitcoin. They just didn't have reddit or twitter to shill it all day.","I think you may be right, but there's also a big negative effect. I'm a full time profitable stock trader, trading stocks for the last five years. I know five years isn't much, but I've seen some interesting stuff, so I'd say I have some experience. With all the crypto frenzy this year, I notice some people around me (relatives, friends) started to think that making money trading is very easy, and I think that's very dangerous. I tried explaining them it isn't the case, they shouldn't trade that much money without experience, but they're so full of rush (I get it), they don't even listen.

WHEN a downturn happens, I don't know when it will happen, but it will (it's the same with stocks, sometimes they go up, sometimes they don't), some of these very people will blame crypto as ""scam"", ""fraud"", ""gambling"", etc. It's only gamble if you are a gambler. I know this from experience because there are people calling stock market the same after they lose money. Not before, but after.

In the end, I think people must educate themselves. They must know rewards and risks before they put their money into a project or trade, no matter how old they are.

To sum up, I think it's good, but be careful."

Bitcoin has no official developers. Bitcoin is merely a protocol, and the people who run it can choose to run whatever version of it they want. There are people who contribute to improving this protocol, but it is up to the bitcoin community (the people who run the protocol) to adopt these new changes.","This is a great question. bitcoin development is maintained by bitcoin core. originally after satoshi released bitcoin they continued to work on it for a while with other developers. they eventually stepped down as bitcoin started getting attention in the media and left Gavin Anderson in charge of maintaining development. later Gavin was basically forced out of development and developers largely from the company blockstream the developer of lighting network took over control of development, headed by adam back. adam has technically step down as a developers but still holds of a lot of say in the developer community.

in the earlier days of bitcoin development was much more decentralized as a number of different dev teams formed that build their own implementation of the bitcoin protocol, that were all compatible with eachother, however in 2017 by the end of the scaling debate and after the bitcoin forked into btc and bch development of the btc chain consolidated into a single implementation which is bitcoin core. this is what miners run today.

on the BCH fork theres 6 different full node implementations run by different teams of devs.","Very good questions. 

""Systemic risk lurks in unacknowledged trust."" This is a quote from Angela Walch, a law professor who is quite outspoken about the façade of ""trustlessness"" in Bitcoin and other blockchain protocols.

Have you ever tried to mine XMR? It's a pain in the ass, every antivirus software on the planet removes it, even with exclusions Windows defender often just decides to quarantine it cause it's Tuesday or delete it cause the 14th was on a Saturday. If hackers sent it out there these days I reckon they'd get about 20 minutes per infected machine (likely at <1k) before it was removed.",Lol have fun with the IRS knocking at your door,XMR and other privacy coins like ZEC will most likely be illegal in the US in a few months.  There is a bill in congress about crypto regulation (not the infrastructure bill) that will most likely pass.

Need I say more? This is part of my portfolio.

Also, TIXL looked promising when it launched. I lost it's clue, but I'll see what's up with it. It basically proposed a model that'd not only lower transaction fees through the use of its own network as a middleman of sorts, but also offered interoperability between blockchains. I think it is more or less similar to what WAN is trying to do.

There are other promising projects, such as MATIC (de-fi, scaling), XMR (privacy), NANO (payments) and HBAR. I remember XLM was also huge promise not long ago, but it seems it lost a lot of steam and there's no more interest in it. Used to have XLM and NANO. Currently, I just bought MATIC's dip, and am looking into HBAR and XRM (would like some advice regarding this)."

txhash sent via DM.","Update:   


The issue has been solved. Back some time ago I enabled requiring a TAG in order to receive XRP to my ledger. I did this because I thought it would give me a TAG in order to receive funds (I did not know that one can use a random TAG at that time). I did not know that this will require any transaction to this address to have a TAG included, even if it is random. This led to me not being able to receive any funds any longer without a TAG as I used to before.   


So yes, I want to apologize to the exchanges for my rant. I was certain it wasn't my mistake due to the fact that I successfully did send funds before and every support told me that I need to have a TAG and I repeatedly said that I used to send funds without TAG successfully before.   


But thanks to the support here from changenow u/AlmightyshO who did a fantastic job in helping me out figure out what the issue was, we could recover the funds.  


The good thing is I learned that we can always be wrong, even if it think we are so absolutely right and I also learned, that we have some truly awesome people here that have the best intentions to help. 

Again, sorry for the misunderstanding, I hope nobody got offended to much. I wish you all a great holiday.","Hi there. ChangeNOW support here.

May I know your exchange ID and txhash? Thank you in advance.

EDIT:

I want to add this.

MEMO (destination tag, payment ID, etc) is needed when many are using the same address (e.g. hot wallets, exchanges), but if you're using a decentralized wallet or cold wallet, hardware wallet, you don't need MEMO. For example, Kucoin tells you that you needed it, then you simply go ahead and add whatever you want (123456789 for example), and then make withdraw, you will receive XRP."

The [smart contract language is a paradigm shifter](https://www.radixdlt.com/post/the-problem-with-smart-contracts-today) and the team has gone to great lengths to comply with regulations.

It's at a moderate mcap right now (about $2.5bil), so there's loads of room to grow in comparison to other layer 1s, but Radix are actually targeting the tradfi market, which is a $500T industry, so comparing to other layer 1s is doing it a disservice.

With that, web3 and the crypto/blockchain networks that it runs on will experience larger than usual growth. NFTs will continue to become more mainstream (Eminiem just bought a BAYC for 500K recently), cryptos will continue to see more money put into them, more Bitcoin ETFs, more crypto accepted in more places.

Once Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Meta, Google, etc. release their mixed reality headsets later this year, metaverse will pick up in full steam as big companies start to build their own and incorporate NFT-based gamified metaverses that work on these headsets. People will join zoom meetings from their glasses while they're working, and play with their friends in the metaverse while they're off work. 

Crypto is going to explode this year IMO, but I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice :D",[deleted],Its going to affect the market for sure and the focus will be lost for many traders. I have switched to using bots from the upbots platform as they never miss and execute perfect trades.

Bitcoin is here to allow us to cut out the unnecessary middlemen who take money from us unnecessarily and have censorship power over the people.

After trying to destroy Bitcoin throughout the 2010s, banks and large private payment companies like PayPal realized that they needed to take a different approach if they were not to be overwhelmed by Bitcoin.

Their goal? To profit from Bitcoin by trying to become an intermediary in a system that doesn't need one.

Thus, American banks will offer their customers to buy Bitcoin through their services. The same thing with PayPal. The catch? You won't be able to access the private keys to your BTC.

So you'll be at the mercy of middlemen again with the fruits of your labor. So you should definitely be wary of these entities that will try to steal the Bitcoin revolution from the people in the coming years.

I try to make you aware of this major risk to the Bitcoin revolution in the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter.","I welcome PayPal, partly how it is role to undermine the banks monopoly, partly because it's very accessible like Venmo to young people to buy crypto. It's a gateway exchange. Yes it has awful fees, you don't hold your keys yet, and it's easy UI makes buying crypto so much easier than it was for us when we got in. But it brings in a lot of people, and I like that.",Don't worry they can offer savings on coins with fees but hathor and iota are fee free. Hathor DEX was... Checkmate.

We should keep blockchain decentralized and away from manipulation.,crypto will always be able to progressively be improved to be able to suit the needs of the majority. A minority that imposes unfair rules that keep them am advantage will eventually have their block chains abandoned for something that's more practical for the average user. people absolutely should realize that crypto is inherently very politic and leverage that rather then tune it out.

An opportunity to understand that patience has always been and will remain, the key with Bitcoin.",I'm sure we'll see 100k sometime in the next 2 years.,"The problem what i see with bitcoin is actually is how many people use it as a currency. Because if what have happened previously, it does not necessarily will repeat. In other words if larger proportion of bitcoin is in a hlod, or just for trading purpose then those who actually use it as a money just stops using it as money, and it value drops to zero. Traditional stock market or fiat is based on some value even it is artificial, or on company capacity to produce. Then, yeah it is nice post but you cannot compare it with traditional stock market. But bitcoin or any cryprocurrency just need to not be used and it loses its liquidity, you are being left with expired currency as it would be in fiat case. 

Correct me if i'm wrong.","Some people just never learn. You don’t sell bitcoin, you hold it till you retire. Bitcoin is not a day trading asset, if you’re over leveraged on a btc position I hope you get shut down. This 100x trading is the reason for all this nonsense. So many noobs in over leveraged positions getting rekt triggering a cascade of sells. Factor that in with the fact that btc is coupled to all altcoins on major exchanges and thats when you get this horseshit. It makes 0 sense that Xrp, ada, or ETH, or any other asset should lose value just because the biggest shitcoin of them all is being dumped by overzealous billionaires and overleveraged noob traders."

It’s astonishing.,"Crypto hate is at very high levels in the gaming community, most gamers don’t know much about crypto other than it’s the sole reason why they can’t get GPUs (not anything to do with the supply chain issues for all chips) and NFTs are bad because they are mostly broke and to them this is just more micro-transactions. Ask anybody who isn’t into crypto about crypto and NFTs they are going to give you a lot of misinformation, it’s not just the news sites mentioned above, it’s almost all of them repeating lies that they don’t even know are lies. The worst lie of them all is how crypto is destroying the planet, like there aren’t industries that are MUCH worse for the planet and that over 60% of the energy produced is lost or wasted. We should be worried about improving efficiencies, like people need to realize that the inefficiencies in homes and appliances are far worse than crypto for the environment by a long shot. A lot of these articles are using old studies based on old data (which was incomplete at the time), some are just referencing their own articles from 2017-2018. If you look at the progress towards more sustainable energy sources since then, the crypto industry is way ahead in percentage of renewables but who’s talking about that? I’ve seen plenty of articles about large solar and wind farms being built by crypto mining companies since 2017, but they aren’t reported widely in the general media. Only that crypto is destroying the planet without putting it into proper context, it’s either lazy journalism or pure and simple propaganda. The more they use FUD during market corrections, the more I believe in the latter case and trust in the media fades.","I've noticed this as well. There are two or three Kotaku writers who put out an angry crypto article every week or two. I totally get the idea that NFT's in games can be done wrong, but there is so much to be excited about with it, like potentially owning and trading digital games that I figured someone higher up was ordering hit pieces on Crypto."

A lot of times, coins just fail. While scams and rug pulls exist in crypto, people scream ""fraud!"" and ""rugpull!"" as soon as a coin starts under preforming. Mostly inexperienced investors. It's annoying. it's like people want to blame something other than themselves for picking a failing project. I've made bad picks, but I don't pick rug pulls. Maybe I'm just lucky.

The problem I think, is people not being able to spot the tell tale signs of a scam, or how to spot honest projects. People either have that sense, or don't. I've always had a keen sense for spotting bullshit, and fraudulent coins stand out to me quite easily.  I've never got rugged or scammed and I've been in and out of probably 100s of coins. But yes the insurance is a nice option, but again i think that's more for if the coin fails, not ""here's insurance in case we rug pull you"" lol. Or who knows, maybe that's a scam.

""City customers who have cryptocurrency stored in their PayPal account can now make payments to the city using that cryptocurrency when they choose PayPal as their payment method,” she said in a memo to City Manager Karen Conard. “This new payment method has no impact on the city’s financial practices as the cryptocurrency is converted to U.S. currency by PayPal before it is sent to our payment processor""

PayPal supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.



So basically if you buy crypto on PayPal (since you can't transfer crypto to and from PayPal) you can use that PayPal to pay for city services which get instantly converted back to USD.

He was using QuadrigcaCx to avoid concurrency conversion fees. Basically, instead of swapping USD straight to CAD, he bought Bitcoin with USD and then sold for CAD.

For $500k, this would have saved him maybe $2 to $3k in bank fees assuming he got the spot conversion rate. He might not have realized through that bitcoin was sold at a discount to the Canadian dollar since there wasn’t much demand. I remember it was always 1 or 2% lower when selling BTC to CAD.

I use polygon daily for 6 months and haven't had a problem yet.","L2beat.com get acquainted with these

In particular Arbitrum, Optimism, starkex, starknet, zksync 2.0

The ones you mentioned aren't scaling solutions they are competitors to Ethereum and polygon is a sidechain. A sidechain is basically another instance of the chain with small changes in the parameters, like for example polygon has sacrificed decentralization to be able to process more transactions and it is using PoS instead of PoW.

Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum as shown on L2beat.com are basically compression mechanisms for Ethereum which allows for much higher throughput. We are currently seeing massive innovation in both layer 2 solutions becoming better at compression and Ethereum as the layer 1 becoming better at supporting layer 2 solutions, this will lead to exponential scaling since if you get 2x improvement from the layer 2 and then also get a 2x improvement from Ethereum you total 4x improvement instead of just 2x if you didn't have the layer 2. Luckily we aren't just seeing 2x improvements but 10-100x on both layer 1 Ethereum layer 2s over the next couple of years. This is progressive prosess and currently scaling is outpacing demand.

L2fees.info let's you see the tx cost on the different layer 2 solutions","If Atom and Polygon didn't exist, I doubt Ethereum would make it compared to other L1 chains like Cardano, Zilliqa or Solana. 

I still believe Cardano can give Ethereum a run for it's money if they can ever actually get their stuff together. But at this point, that's a big if."

The latest statement from the director of the IMF shows how much the current system puts your money at risk.","In this article the author posits that US monetary policy is to blame for inflation. They go on to show that the M1 money supply has exploded in the USA and have corellated that with the recent inflation. They also tell us to look back to the 80s for the last example of this.

If this is true, why is inflation worse in almost every other country right now? Also, the M1 money supply was stable 30 years ago when inflation hit so I am not getting the correlation there either. I feel like the primary drivers of inflation today is probably not ""printing"" fiat.

Besides that, money is supposed to be inflationary according to my understanding. If it wasn't, there would be no need to invest. You could just sock cash away under your mattress. The problem with doing that is if money's future value is always higher than its current value, nobody would be spending it. 

Think about BTC as a currency. Volitility aside, why would I use BTC for purchases if I knew that later it would be worth more? Most people wouldn't and currently don't, right? They either speculate with it or hold. This isn't good for a currency since it doesn't make sense to use it today and miss out on tomorrow's potential profits. Currency being inflationary keeps it circulating like a hot potato and encourages investment in other assets that have function beyond what cash can do, like moving your wealth into the future or growing wealth. In other words, cash isn't designed to make you rich, it's designed to circulate. 

A lot of people talk poorly of inflationary assets but again, if the purpose of a digital asset is to be a currency replacement, I think this is a strong feature that would lead to adoption and use more so than a deflationary model.",,

Build a network from the ground up with it's own system of security, mining or minting, nodes etc. Or use an already existing infrastructure to just deploy your app and asset and work just in your use case.

If is the first case I don't know for sure but bitcoin was made in C++, so I guess traditional languages work.

If you just need a token then check the platform of your choice. Ethereum uses solidity for example, and other platforms use their own.

As you can see i don't really know much about it but at least I hope I gave you a clue. Finally I've seen courses that seem pretty good in Udemy (like [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/) one) if you want to check it out.","In the current market? Strong marketing, basically.

Half jokes aside, there's a good book based on a series of articles about building a blockchain in python. It has a blue cover. Do you want me to dig it out? I followed along and made mine in C# and found it very good.

I also liked an article I saw about building a blockchain in Crystal (think compiled Ruby) if you want me to find that for you.","I'm not a technical guy, but I can offer a suggestion.  There is a project I'm involved with developing and ecosystem of tokens.  Some projects they develop internally, some are external partnerships that roll up into the ecosystem.  Their focus is on bringing new and innovative ideas into the digital asset space and are always looking for new ideas and have a support structure with multiple dev teams and program managers to help get new projects in the ecosystem off the ground.  Plus, each project within the ecosystem benefits from the shared utilities they offer.  If you're interested, shoot me a DM and I can get you in touch with some of the team to discuss your idea and if interested, how they can help.  Good luck to you."

Keep your head up, everyone. Best of luck investing!","Small word of encouragement. I wasn't into crypto then (wasn't very big at that time), but I did spend much of my savings in courses and stuff. Don't regret it, but the fact is that childhood savings were definitely spent, almost spent up.

You will get the chance to earn them back, especially if you have not yet started on your career / jobs. If anything, it's probably the best time to lose money, if there's such a thing.

Why is this guy given any clout is beyond me at this point.",Put his ass in jail,"The problem here is a very old one, it’s banking 101: the cryptosystem had little to do with the core issue, other than accelerating the demise at the end.

Translating back into conventional finance language:

A bank has to pay interest on deposits that’s less than the interest it earns on its loans. Terra didn’t.  It paid much more on its deposits than it earned, and made up for the difference by issuing more and more equity shares (equity being LUNA).  Which works only as long as the equity price is going up. 

The algorithmic part meant that more and more equity had to be printed/diluted to pay the UST liability. This also has a parallel in trad fi, known as “toxic convertible debt”, where conversion price goes down and down when equity goes down, and is used only by the scummiest of penny stocks and scummiest of financiers.

Obviously if this had been an actual bank, it would be illegal.  It’s precisely why there are banking regulators which intrusively inspect a bank’s private information like assets and liabilities, and prevents them from doing unsustainable scams."

This is shit quality reporting and **OP should be embarrassed for calling this news**.","When a new client with no transaction history connects to a blockchain network, the first thing it needs to do is download the blockchain.  What happens if an attacker in control of multiple nodes is feeding new clients with data for a counterfeit blockchain?  The new client needs a way to distinguish the genuine blockchain from the fake.

Proof of work makes this easy because the work done to secure the blockchain is stored in it.  As long as the majority of hash power goes to securing the genuine blockchain, it will be the longest chain with the most work.

Staking can't be used this way.  Proof of stake networks must rely on a different, and likely less secure, method of authenticating the genuine blockchain.  That's why they will always have security issues that can never be fixed.",The hell is a bitcoin developer

If the SEC/CFTC decides to start regulating, then we'll be okay...but they should start with the fucking rampant disregard for laws already in place in the securities and futures markets FIRST. If they do end up ""regulating"" crypto, there will no longer be anything fair or regulated in the crypto markets which is why crypto has been under attack.

They want the ability to manipulate the crypto markets and centralization under THEIR control - the exact opposite of what crypto stands for.

**The Secret Recovery Phrase**

Let’s start with the Secret Recovery Phrase. When you first install MetaMask, you were shown a list of 12 words known as the Secret Recovery Phrase. MetaMask uses a specification known as the BIP39 to generate these 12 words.


BIP stands for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals. BIP39 recommends the use of a mnemonic phrase (a group of easy to remember words) to serve as a mean to recover your accounts in the event your accounts are compromised or lost. MetaMask calls this mnemonic phrase the Secret Recovery Phrase.


These 12 words in the Secret Recovery Phrase are generated from a list of 2048 words. The complete list of 2048 words can be found from here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt.


The order of the words in the secret recovery phrase is important.


Each word in the secret recovery phrase has a number associated with it. These numbers are used to form a seed integer, which is then used to create a set of public/private keys.","In short, transactions are ""signed"" using your private key and a unique transaction counter (""nonce"") before being sent to validators. A valid signature on a transaction let's the validator know that the transaction was created by someone with the private key, but does not reveal the key itself. So directly answer your question, any operations involving your raw private key happen in the wallet client, not at the validator level.",

BTC was never meant to replace the USD, it was added as a legal form of payment. Perhaps the president had a dream of everyone ditching their USD but people are not stupid. 

In short there hasn’t been much impact on El Salvador. Everyone who downloaded a wallet was given $30 free BTC, which is about three days work for average wage earner. How many actually decided to ditch the US dollar and start transacting only in BTC, probably no one. 

If the UK or Indonesia made BTC legal tender, I don’t believe much would change, unless they literally banned all payments in fiat and only allowed transactions in BTC. Which is never going to happen. 

What makes BTC a volatile asset is the fact that it’s speculated by institutional investors who view it as a high risk asset. These guys can make money on upswings and downswings. As the supply is fixed when large institutions are hoovering up BTC the price explodes and just as we have seen over the past year, when they decide to exit their positions, the price declines. Basically supply vs demand.","There is no takeaway yet.  It’s way too early to say anything yet.  Keep watching the space, or just come back on a couple of years.  Maybe the remindme! Bot thing?",Key takeaway: Don’t. Just don’t.
