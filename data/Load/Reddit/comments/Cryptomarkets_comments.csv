Choosing between Crypto Mining and Crypto Staking,What do most people think of when they hear cryptocurrency staking?,"I would argue than the both approach has flaws such as:

1. Proof of work: based on computing power (HashRate), the flaw that can be exploited by an attacker, is to gather during a given period a computing power equivalent to the power of the entire network. The security of the network is at mercy of the computing power of its nodes.
2. Proof of stake: The main risks for Proof-of-Stake, beyond the somewhat recentralized nature of consensus, are taking control by financial means and for an attacker to be able to concentrate his attack on a few nodes of the network to take control.

So Why Stake and Why Mining, when we can have a strongest approach while maintaining a high level of decentralization with a high scalability.  
This consensus is named **ARCH** (Atomic Rotating Commitment Heuristic) supporting 90% of malicious nodes with 1M TPS.

Greetings r/CryptoMarkets. The mod team is introducing a meme experiment which will be
enforced by a custom bot, ie u/CCMemeBot. Our goal is to test and develop it here so it may one day
replace the current Weekend Memes policy at r/CryptoCurrency.

In contrast to the Weekend Memes policy at CC, this experiment will allow **daily** memes but will cut down on the spam by only
allowing 1 meme every 12 hours. The memes will be selected  from r/CryptoCurrencyMemes based on
which has the most upvotes. The benefits of this new arrangement will be:

1. Meme posters will not have to rely on precise timing or dumb luck to get their meme on the top
page without violating the 2 meme limit rule.

2. The selected memes will be competitively sourced, so they're likely to be of better quality.

this competition, post your best memes in r/CryptoCurrencyMemes. Good luck.",,

Coming soon, to a bank near you.","I like how these negative interest rates articles are gobbled up in crypto forum as if negative rates motivate anyone to change to crypto. What most don't know here, these banks are forced to pass on negative interest rates. Why you ask?

The European Central Bank charges them -0.60 (minus threshold) on overnight Euro.  The real economic cost for the bank of holding your Euro on your current account probably amounts to -1%. So obviously Banks are forced to charge the client negative rates and anything below -0.6 can be regarded as reasonable. 

If you want to point your finger at anyone do it at central Banks for their failed monetary policies.

I'm curious about a couple of things here:
where does this ""thousands per month"" come from?

A)  As in ""thousands per month"" from one computer hacked? Do they target those PC's with better mining hardware (think home PC builder with top of the line graphics card? (do they still use these to mine? I haven't looked into mining in awhile) Is the ""thousands of dollars per month"" an average, one computer (presumably the desktop rig with all the amenities), or the total from all computer hacked in a month?

But keep in mind, that massive short squeeze and then run up to $14k is ALSO fresh in people's minds.  Shorts are piling up right now but longs are as well. A lot of long positions have been waiting to enter the market and the OTC market is going absolutely insane right now buying up.  We complain that BTC is manipulated but if you can't fix the system at least play it's games.  


At this point seeing the huge flows into BTC and knowing the halving is coming up leads me to believe we won't see below $5k, but $5k wouldn't surprise me.  I do believe that at $5k we will see shorts closing positions and a squeeze will be on.  These recent short positions ( a lot of them) would get stopped out rapidly with any real positive news as well. It might be declining but the CONDITIONS and SENTIMENT right now do not seem to mimic that of crypto-winter last year if you ask me.",,

Developed by [Richard Heart](https://twitter.com/RichardHeartWin), the tokens function as time deposits made over the Ethereum network. However, the project isn't without criticism. Comparisons to the infamous [Bitconnect](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitconnect?src=hashtag_click) project from 2017 have been swirling A passage:

*The project‚Äôs hype page encourages users to hand in ‚Äúcheap ETH‚Äù for an asset where ‚Äúthe price can only go up‚Äù. However, nothing ensures the actual price of HEX, and the scheme remains extremely risky.*

*Critics point out that Heart, as the alleged owner of HEX‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúorigin address,‚Äù will potentially control around 45% of the entire HEX supply just one year after the launch. This will be achieved by claiming a constant stream of HEX tokens from various types of transactions, while Heart will also keep the ETH from purchases.*

I've circled each of the largest spikes (or at least the majority) in relation to what the price change of ETH was at the time the respective daily spike occurred. These circles I drew show the daily percent changes from the exact days that these negative sentiment spikes happened. Pretty clearly, we can see that the crowd's behavioral tendency skews toward mentioning that crypto is dead or dying any time there is a sharp move downward. This reflects just how trivial some of the crowd talks can be, and how most chime in *after* the fact on a downward moving day. Almost never before.

Tracking behavioral crowd studies, the way we did with [this study I released a couple weeks](https://insights.santiment.net/read/ain%E2%80%99t-no-lie%2C-buy-buy-buy%3F-a-study-on-crowd-behavior-3229?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=reddit_aint_no_lie_buy_buy_buy_article_brian_122319) ago about mentions of buying vs. selling, is a great way to improve the results of your trading and staying ahead of the curve.

This was due largely to their announcement of [J](https://twitter.com/hashtag/justgame?src=hashtag_click)ust.Game. Though the game that relies on buying ""boxes"" and promoting them smells, looks, and feels a whole lot like a [\#ponzi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ponzi?src=hashtag_click) scheme, much of the project's loyal following seems to be convinced that this project to earn free Tron is a net positive... in spite of the fact that Justin himself had tremendous difficulty purchasing a box during his own version of ""Let's Play on the game. Taking a look at our social metrics for Tron, we see that sentiment recently turned negative after a 12% price spike, which quickly disappeared. As [\#Tron](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tron?src=hashtag_click) gives its loyal following the ""gift of gaming"" this Christmas , we have to wonder whether this was already done correctly back in 1982.

Since global money supply is only around 100 trillion and much of that will be held by governments and institutions too, this number has to include asset valuations e.g property and equities.

Does it also factor in debt/liabilities and liquidity? Lots of asset classes wouldn‚Äôt be worth anywhere near as much if everyone tried to liquidate them, particularly if they are backed by debt e.g mortgages.

It‚Äôs hard to see investors of any generation not diversifying or continuing to hold wealth in property. Even if asset classes get ‚Äútokenised‚Äù as the video suggests, those tokens would still be physically backed by the underlying asset. 

Sure, more will get invested in the sector and it will no doubt grow, but I don‚Äôt think implying $70 trillion is remotely likely to be invested is very helpful.",

I plugged in 15 of the most commonly discussed ERC-20's that we track, and made some fairly simple formulas to calculate what the **top 5** holders (by volume) of each token hold in terms of the total portion of the supply of that respective token.

This tracks the cumulative difference over the last 30 days of how much these top holder bags have increased/decreased (eg. adding 1% of the total supply per day would equal a 30% increase for a project over 30 days). The colors blend a bit, but I'll probably work on some graphical improvements in the coming weeks. But everything works and is accurate up to date. The dark blue you see leading the pack in the top right is none other than Ethereum, which has seen the top five holders increase their bags approximately 13% of the total supply in the last month. Generally, the top holders hold the keys to price direction, so this can be a solid leading indicator for our users.

Anyone who wants to [try out our Sanbase Pro will get free access to this chart](https://santiment.net/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=reddit_top_holders_cumulative_percent_change_brian_011720) on Sansheets in real-time, and they'll also be able to try out Sandata to get further insights on top holder stats and anything else under the sun that we offer.

ICO  as we know it is a failed model for the plebs who don't have like whole week to properly research each and every one of them. So far, we know that you can't trust even the community because they are more intent on evangelizing their pet shitcoins than actually care about the validity. We also know that if you pay money to people, you can even have a bunch of them to hype the coin up. 

I would rather we have more open source coins than promote ICO's in hopes we get another ETH.

IEO's are far more trustworthy because atleast your only point of failure is the exchange(low chance of that happening) and not 7 points of failure because you participated in 7 ICO's.( high chance of getting scammed)

 With most(not all) big exchanges, you atleast know where they are located so that you can seek recourse when things go south."

As a result, the cumulative balance of all ETH mining pools is currently hovering at an **all-time-high** of 1.69M ETH (which has a current value of \~$300M).

These periods of accumulation tend to suggest high confidence levels in the project among the majority block creators, at the very least relative to the current market conditions. On the other hand, major miner sell-offs have often been followed by quick and significant price corrections historically.

The last time the network‚Äôs miners held on to this much ETH was back in late October of 2019, when a drop below $170 prompted some to offload their holdings. Barring major market volatility this time around, we‚Äôre likely to breach this milestone within the next few days.

It is to get buy support to break resistance and actually reverse the trend?  


Is it because we can expect the price to bounce of 10.5k and those in the know want to sell their bags before rebuying lower?

I think Bitcoin will be the most affected by it, and cryptocurrencies will be affected a result of their unspoken peg to BTC. 

There are some things I want to caution you about regarding your logic:

1. China does not need blockchain technology to ""avoid useless physical contact."" The country is already 99% digital currency using the WeChat and Alipay payment systems. Consumers do not carry around physical cash; in fact, it's more likely that stores accept WeChat and Alipay than cash. Even in undeveloped parts of the country, the citizens and businesses accept WeChat and Alipay. Physical cash is so gone that tourists, who have not been able to get WeChat/Alipay accounts until late last year, felt inconvenient traveling around the country since cash wasn't always accepted, but WeChat/Alipay was (some merchants don't even have change to give).
2. A digital currency does not mean blockchain. Any price correlation between announcements of a central bank digital currency and cryptocurrency prices is largely due to ignorance of that fact. Sort of like how people always shill Ripple the company's accomplishments, yet none of it has anything to do with Ripple's cryptocurrency. Ripple's remittance protocol is what its partners are interested in, not the coin, and Ripple is not going to shove the coin down anyone's throats if their protocol system is working fine without it.
3. Blockchain does not store confidential medical data. Medical data is heavily guarded by national-level compliance that varies from country to country. Blockchain may store hashes of the data, but the hash does not contain the data itself. A hash is just a signature of the data. It's like if I signed a guestbook of a bed & breakfast. It proves that I was at the location, but it's not like the bed and breakfast now owns me.
4. Your comparison between ""global markets"" and cryptocurrencies is an apples-to-oranges comparison. I assume that the market you're talking about is equity markets, which has taken a hit recently and the coronavirus is likely a culprit due to China's lockdown response, and the slowdown of global manufacturing that is a result of that lockdown. Your comparison to cryptocurrencies goes back to New Years, though. If you look at the stock market at that time and its performance up until the coronavirus, it has demonstrated some impressive (albeit worrying) growth as well. Similarly, in the recent few days, cryptocurrency prices have also taken a hit, just like the equity markets.",,

Each month, we shine a spotlight on the 10 ERC-20 projects with the highest-recorded developer activity for the past 30 days,[ as calculated by Santiment](http://app.santiment.net/).

Development Activity is an often-underrated indicator of project success, as it demonstrates the month-to-month commitment to creating a working product, continuously polishing and upgrading its features, and staying true to the long-term roadmap.

In this report, we are focusing only on ‚Äòpure ERC-20‚Äô, i.e. those projects that are (currently) committed to developing on Ethereum, and have as of yet no working mainnet or an imminent token swap.

You can check out the latest dev activity ‚Äòpower rankings‚Äô for all ERC-20 assets on[ Sanbase,](https://app.santiment.net/assets/erc20) by filtering the ERC-20 projects by Dev Activity (30d).

Here is the rankings list in text form, according to our metrics:

1. Gnosis (GNO)
2. Status (SNT)
3. Aragon (ANT)
4. Augur (REP)
5. Chainlink (LINK)
6. Simple Token (OST)
7. Raiden (RDN)
8. 0x (ZRX)
9. Maker (MKR)
10. Neumark (NEU)

I think questions like this are great to reflect on, and very hard to answer with a general 'which is better statement'.   

It is equally easy to say that 'Altcoins seem like it's a better market for people with high funds who want to take a chance to strike it big'  1000$ in this sense may be only a small amount of capital compared to the higher portfolio total, in this sense since Alts are higher risk, if they go to 0 it's only like losing 10% - 1% of one's folio. (Think 1,000$ out of 10,000$ - 100,000$ respectively)  Whereas alternatively, if 1000$ is your entire folio and alts go to 0 then you've lost 100% of your folio and your out of the game.    

This is all further complicated by factors of how easy it is for someone to remake the 1000$ they are putting in, what their belief in the market is, what their strategy for holding is etc.    


I know this may feel like no question was answered, however I hope it did help shed light on an answer to the question.  Truly gambling/investing etc is all about goal orientation, strategy, and of course - luck.","ETH > BTC.

[https://entethalliance.org/members/](https://entethalliance.org/members/)

Research the companies on that list it should give you some confidence.

I however am not 100% sure on any other crypto right now everything i own is swapped into Ethereum. Worst case Scenario everything dies and Ethereum absorbs some of the market cap while the people building actual use cases for Ethereum restore the value over time."

They have greatly reduced the amount of capital flowing from larger to smaller cap projects and back, greatly diminishing upward price movements of all, which prior to fiat stablecoins was a strong positive feedback loop. Because of this capital flow reduction, fiat stablecoins have also negatively impacted innovation as many smaller projects that are typically willing to take more risks have less resources to put towards development efforts.

As a separate side note: The so-called ""innovation"" we see today is so-called ""DeFi"", a misnomer because none of those platforms are actually decentralized. These are pet-projects of the large caps. Appropriately enough, these projects get a lot of attention lately with tags like ""We're working with SWIFT"" and ""Central Banks want to use us"".","Is this unpopular opinion bashing stable coins for being stable? üòÇ

Done.

Before anyone tries to come at me with metrics of how crypto works, throwing infinitely harder difficulty at a mathematical problem that needs computing power no solar grid could ever handle as the hash rate pushes said difficulty up, could exist, is a problem that no coin can escape and naturally caps their investments from people having to lose money as difficulty increases. No one runs a coin pool just for charity, that internet and electricity has real costs that difficulty only makes you less likely to profit on.

Right now you‚Äôd be better off investing in tech stocks because they are providing solutions to real problems, not tin hat conspiracies that have yet to be a problem compared to all the other ones we have.

Any person who understands money would see blockchain is just another Forex market created for people who fall for conspiracy memes.

Interesting article,I have heard that BTC is a surveillance coin. I'm thinking of accepting some crypto currency for payments. Why would anybody choose to use BTC over any other coin (especially businesses)?,">As Bitcoin‚Äôs price decreases, a miner‚Äôs net profitability decreases, and margins are compressed. Thus, they have to sell more Bitcoin, which increases selling pressure. Inefficient miners have to sell more, and this accelerates sell-offs. When the price is increasing, miners can hold on to more Bitcoin and don‚Äôt have to sell as much, which decreases sell pressure and can cause the price to spike further.

There's another option here that you don't discuss:  If miners can't make profit, they have the option of not mining any more and getting out of the market entirely.   This is a much more likely scenario.

The more significant elephant in the room is, what happens to the market when mining isn't profitable?  How is the blockchain operated when those who would operate it lose money in doing so?

One problem with the bitcoin ecosystem is that its healthy operation is exclusively based on the price always going up.  But bitcoin has no intrinsic value other than what you can convince someone else to pay for it.  And such a model is not sustainable.  And once there's no financial incentive for miners, the network can collapse.

There's a popular saying in the finance world: ""Past performance is not a predictor of future results.""

It's also interesting to see now, in the wake of independent mining not being practical, that pundits are embracing institutional mining pools -- which by many would be considered a reversal of one of the benefits bitcoin offered, namely decentralization.  This security seems to continually represent one concept, then dance around to another.   This seems worrisome.  With more than 85% of the BTC already mined, and a vast majority of it in the hand of a small number of whales, this money-of-the-future is looking more and more like a traditional, centralized, monetary system."

In 2015 bitcoin was around 300, with a peak of around 15000 in 2017. That‚Äôs a 50 fold change, where is this in the plot?","This graphic is 100% bullshit. As u/uniqueturtlelove pointed out, bitcoin saw a 5000% increase in price within a year; none of those assets - except maybe oil (which everyone knows is volatile) - has seen anything near that level of volatility; and even oil is relatively stable, and only gets unstable in geopolitical tumultuous times.

Crap like this is why so many people don't take cryptomarkets or it's proponents seriously. A lot of it's biggest proponents mislead, or straight up lie just to prop up bitcoin or other cryptos.

From the article: ‚Äúthe asset was created from nothing and has nothing tangible to derive its value from.‚Äù 

Two blatantly false statements. Clearly, it was NOT created from nothing- it didn‚Äôt spontaneously combust into existence like the universe. It was created from a complex computer program. 

Nothing tangible to drive it value from - misses. at least five valuable property unique to bitcoin: it‚Äôs rare but not that rare, it is easily divisible, it is practically indestructible, it is uniform, and it is anonymous. These properties provide value. More specifically, they enable bitcoin to become a legitimate medium of exchange. 

The logical fallacy is this idea of belief. While it‚Äôs true that bitcoin has value because people believe in it, the question is really why do people believe in it? Writers such as this one tend to believe that people believe in bitcoin because everybody else does. But that‚Äôs absolutely false. People believe in bitcoin because of its unique characteristics.",Buy order for 18.5m bitcoin at $0.01 per.,"I think the miners that spend their earnings to power their machines would beg to differ about the ‚Äúno tangible value‚Äù assertion, which is clearly derived of amateur ignorance."

Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange protocol focussed on data collation, sharing, and monetization, has announced a pilot project partnering with Mercedes-Benz‚Äô manufacturer Daimler AG.

Daimler‚Äôs South East Asia subsidiary will use blockchain-based solutions to gather and monetize the firm‚Äôs data.

The pilot will demonstrate Ocean Protocol‚Äôs recently launched ""Compute-to-Data"" protocol to protect the privacy of Daimler‚Äôs data while allowing the information to be analyzed and aggregated by third parties.

Mercedes trials DLT data pilot with Ocean Protocol

Ocean is hoping that the pilot will attract further partnerships with major global firms, describing the pilot as a scalable blueprint for deployment.

Hartmut Muller, Daimler‚Äôs vice president of IT, stated, ‚ÄúWe believe in the power of blockchain to unlock the value of data in a decentralized way.‚Äù

Frank Schur, Daimler Singapore‚Äôs senior manager of IT technology, described the decentralized data marketplaces as ‚Äúan interesting position‚Äù providing ‚Äúan exciting opportunity for aggregation of data with a clear compensation approach.‚Äù

Pilot uses Ocean‚Äôs ""Compute-to-Data""

The pilot will comprise the first major initiative employing Ocean‚Äôs latest release, ""Compute-to-Data.""

Launched in mid-May, Compute-to-Data seeks to allow entities to maintain the privacy of their data while allowing third-parties to perform ‚Äúspecific computation jobs‚Äù analyzing said information. 

The results of the protocol‚Äôs analysis can then be packaged for monetization or shared to inform scientific or technological research.",,

Coins are just one aspect too. Securitized tokens benefit from custodial services and enable virtually anything you can think of to be able to be traded 24/7.  Why is this good? 

Products and services that are trade able in public markets are more liquid, ie can be converted to cash quickly.  Why is this important? Such assets trade at higher multiples due to increased liquidity.  Let me say that again‚Äîassets with higher liquidity trade at higher multiples.  

Thus, securitized tokens will increase the underlying value of....virtually anything within reason.  A farmer could securitize his farming operations and you could buy 10% of his artichoke crop...and sell it.

Its main focus lies with providing cryptocurrency projects with an option to force the locking of liquidity, ensuring no ‚Äúrug pull‚Äù can be orchestrated by nefarious actors. One recent example is the SushiSwap incident, which created a lot of dismay among investors.



That's great. There is a big issue with projects using Uniswap to exit scam.
At auguest I almost invested in one of those projects [Two Token Projects Seemingly Exit Scam Shortly After Listing on Uniswap](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2020/08/two-token-projects-seemingly-exit-scam-shortly-after-listing-on-uniswap/)

From a quick look at LID website I see that's one of the main problems they plan to solve:

here is a Leaked BNT Alpha from private research report i found( I though it was Pretty cool):

""Now the interesting question is what that protocol could be worth.. The first point to repeat here is that Bancor‚Äôs value proposition addresses a pain point of liquidity providers, and can not be easily replicated even when the entire code is published. This means the Bancor protocol has a moat, and this means it will be able to retain a portion of value it creates. The question is what a reasonable trading volume is. Uniswap currently has between USD 300-900m per day, and someone like Deutsche Boerse is at USD 3bn+ per day in equities alone. If we assume 1bn per day at 0.4% fee (two legs) this is USD 4m per day or about USD 1.5bn per year. At a 10x multiple that‚Äôs a business value of USD 15bn. How much of this Bancor would be able to capture in this scenario is not clear but based on this scenario a valuation of USD 5-10bn might not be considered unreasonable, in our view.""",,

""Decentralized finance was created to bank the un-banked, revolutionize personal finance, and allow permissionless lending, borrowing, and earning interest. While the actual DeFi lending protocols themselves have made great strides toward decentralization, the vast majority of value that flows through DeFi protocols is transferred in the form of centralized stablecoins such as USDC and Tether which can be locked and frozen by the issuing corporations. The centralized nature of these stablecoins presents a vulnerability risk that gives outside corporations the ability to freeze funds and block certain wallets thereby negating the entire goals of DeFi. Migrating from centralized stablecoins to decentralized stablecoins should be considered as a way to enhance the robustness and decentralization of DeFi protocols""

Fast run-ups in price put tremendous pressure on transaction fees. Both because it increases network congestion, as well as because gas is denominated in Ether. In USD terms, transaction fees have increased by 1500% in just a few months.

Ethereum's strongest selling point has always been Turing complete smart contracts which power distributed apps (dApps). But deploying and running those contracts requires a lot of gas compared to regular transactions. When gas fees rise so quickly, that dissuades development of smart-contract based dApps. Long-term that means less innovation, and therefore less demand. Bitcoin is purely about being a store of value, so rapid price increases are fine. But Ethereum has the much more ambitious goal of powering a new distributed Internet. Pure speculation drives out the real work needed to be done to make reach this goal. 

I'm as happy as anyone that the Ether in my wallet is worth today than a few months ago. But for the long-term health of the project, I really hope the bull run is over for now.",Do you think there will be a dip or a correction soon as I want to buy more at a lower price if possible.

Crypto currencies more or less move as a basket much like their fiat counterparts.  Currencies are articulated in such a way that they must be compared to other currencies to find their relative value at that moment.  

With that being said, the rise and fall of equities and crypto currencies ultimately rely on the ability of market players to have the confidence to buy them in the first place.  Institutional investors are, by mandate, able to execute discipline much more readily than the average retail investor.  Institutions hodl much better than you ever can.  Retail will more than likely flee first because retail is emotional.  We talk big but let's get real.

This is a good mental exercise to go through.  Be clear with the thesis that you have for your holdings.  Disregard the appearance of  a bear market.  It's inevitable.  It will come eventually because that is the nature of things.  What's more important is for you to figure out, without emotion, if your thesis has changed.  

If the reason why you are in crypto hasn't changed, then there's no need for you to liquidate your position.  If your reason to be bullish in crypto persists, then take advantage of the lower prices and increase your position.  Again, this hinges on your thesis and you actively managing your emotions.","I think crypto will go down if the stock market goes down as it did last March.

I've tested my own strategy with a small live cash trading account. My strategy basically turns the stock market into a risk-free factory production line. Long hours (40-50 hrs per week), and those hours are intense, no half-measures. Here it is:

\- NEVER EVER use leverage, margin, options, calls, puts, any of that crap. Spot trading only. Only ever go long (buy low or sell high - those are both exactly the same thing). If you're trading with any kind of borrowed money, you're doing it wrong.

\- Trade between exactly 4 tickers that ALL pair with each other (so there should be 6 pairs: AB AC AD BC BD CD). One is your home currency (USD, GBP, EUR, etc), another is probably the exchange's in-house currency, and two cryptocurrencies (probably BTC and ETH, but any two will do). Forex is a time-bomb, when a hedgie farts sideways you lose everything. All four of your tickers must be paired with each other and all have a large volume of movement.

\- Learn how to read a 1-minute chart. If you can't predict with 80%+ accuracy when a stock is changing direction, you need to go learn that first (Look up ""Raynor Teo"").

\- When you get it wrong (it happens), look at the other charts for that commodity you hold and see where else you can take profit from the time of your last trade. If, worst case scenario, your stock is losing value everywhere, then just wait it out - This ""lockout"" happens occasionally, but it's rare - NEVER SELL LOW, NEVER USE A STOP LOSS. This ""agility"" to change chart or wait it out is only possible with spot trading. NEVER EVER BORROW MONEY OR BET IN ANY WAY AT ALL, ONLY TRADE WHAT YOU PUT IN.

Doing this in my testing, and going at it hard, I make about 5-10 trades per hour at 0.1%-0.2% net profit each (after broker and tax fees deducted), giving me total of up to 1% profit per hour, every hour, consistently.

This only works with small amounts up to around ¬£8,000 ($10,000) maximum. When you hit that limit, withdraw 75% to your savings account and start the process again. Trying this quick-fire strategy with larger sums of money doesn't work because your orders take too long to fill before the price jumps up your arse. THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU A MILLIONAIRE, but if you put in the 40+ intense hours it can make you a few grand per month, better than flipping burgers or delivering pizza.

*(Legal disclaimer: It works for me but please don't go blindly risking your money on my advice, I'm not responsible for your losses. Do your own testing and research. If you lose money with this strategy, you're 100% to blame because you didn't do it right.)*",Ol' Billy Ball Bag!

[https://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/-/media/corporate/allfiles/document/professional-resources/business-management/central-bank-digital-currency.pdf?la=en&rev=068f9a0272104963b1c0cc0ded28068d](https://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/-/media/corporate/allfiles/document/professional-resources/business-management/central-bank-digital-currency.pdf?la=en&rev=068f9a0272104963b1c0cc0ded28068d)

This footnote is a reference to an experiment in 2020 by the French Central Bank to investigate the possibilities and problems with a CBDC.

[https://www.ledgerinsights.com/banque-de-france-wholesale-cbdc-non-bank-usage-digital-euro/](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/banque-de-france-wholesale-cbdc-non-bank-usage-digital-euro/)

Again, without any direct relationship with Ripple / XRP / BTC / ETH as a CBDC...

In this report from august 2020..

...the French Central Bank also names BTC, ETH and XRP but just to make clear that the use of those three crypto currencies is still higly volatile and that they are not very usable as a digital currency, or as a CBDC. The report also compares Tether as a stablecoin, and they see more advantages in using Tether.. (page 3)

So just because XRP is mentioned a few times as an example, there is totaly NO proof or news that XRP is being investigated as ""the next digital Euro""...

To be honnest, the French Central Bank doesn't decide anything in Europe as it comes to creating a platform for a digital euro. That's up the the European Central Bank...

Out of everyone I know only... 5? of them have bitcoin. One of them has just over 2, and she isn't selling. Of course, she bought hers back when it was under 20,000 I think, so she is very much without anything to lose. The thing is, the more that people buy BTC and just take it off of the exchange completely, the more it will be worth. If you bought in near the peak or something, then absolutely sell or make a stop loss. Don't fool yourself into thinking BTC stays bullish forever, because it most likely won't. After you do what you gotta do for your exit strategy, look at the chart for the past 2 months. Identify the very bottom of every dip that has happened, where the price fell from, and how much these dips differ. You will be able to find a far better entry point like this, but it could still tank. Rather than worry about this treat it like a retirement fund, and if you see a major dip then put a little more money in. I am certain it will go lower, but I doubt it will cross 50000. We'll just have to wait and see.","Well, To prevent this I suggest diversifying.

2. Whitepaper and goals

3. Sector. Will the sector be important for the future? Will the product utilized both by Company and People? 

4. Team. 

5. community","That's tricky.  Everyone will try to sell you their own bags.  Reading white papers can be confusing and tiresome.  It's not too hard for someone to make a fancy looking webpage, create some difficult to understand information that sounds promising, and brag about a partnership with Microsoft because they use Office 365.

Things I look for are

-Being able to see real humans behind the project that I can google and find articles written by, maybe a linked in, twitter, etc.

-Having a message that can be understood easily

-I usually join their telegram to see how active they are and if they are more focused on building a product as opposed to hype.  Discord is also an option

-I try to invest according to how big the marketcap is.  If less than 1-2 million, I might only invest a tiny bit.  If market cap is 5-20, I'll put in a little bit bigger of an amount.

Now, this next part sounds a little shilly, but I figure it would demonstrate my process.  I have invested early in both Ecomi and Rocki because they are NFT's that had a good usecase.  Rocki for example, has a streaming service and launching music based NFT's.  I can see who is behind the project and try out their product.

Another example would be me investing in Parachute, because of their upcoming Derivatives market they are producing called Hedgey.  I saw an established team that cares far more about building an exchange that will be used than hyping something for quick gains.  I figured if I get in early enough,  I could have a bag that could be used as a passive income collecting fee's from staking their governance token.

The final part is how do you filter out all the noise of everyone shilling their coins.  I found a few smaller telegram groups useful for this.  

Hope that helps","Not to shill Coin Bureau too much, but I‚Äôd recommend watching [this altcoin research guide](https://youtu.be/GIfihSBT6Bc) by him and seeing what stats mentioned are important to you."

XRP. If you look into XRP and its history I don‚Äôt think it will be the long term play. I.E,

* It is centralised.
* Though The main issue I see with it long term is that if any banks or financial institutions do partner with ripple, they would use the ripple network with their own token but not the XRP token itself. So what value does the XRP token have then?

Cardano. Technologically a great coin. Strong and active Dev team. Dapps and smart contracts. PoS. High transactions per second. Essentially it is the next generation Ethereum. But Personally I‚Äôm unsure if they will overtake the Ethereum first mover advantage long term as Ethereum seems to be pivoting well, though it has great potential.

BNB. Essentially a centralised copy of Ethereum, in that you Can build Dapps on it and uses the same architecture. But it is deflationary in that tokens are regularly burned. It is Used as the native token of the Binance exchange and can be used to reduce fees paid on trades on the binance exchange. I personally don‚Äôt think that the binance exchange will go away as it is SO large, but I can‚Äôt say whether it will be bigger than Cardano or not long term.

For reference, I have held a large portion of BNB since it was $9. I don‚Äôt hold the other coins. As always these are just thoughts, make sure to do your own research.",[HEX](hex.com)

It used to be less tied together and it may be that some coins aren‚Äôt as closely linked. But correlation is getting higher now than it used to be. Gold and silver seem to be more correlated to stocks than I expected as well.,"Yes and No. Look back to march of last year. In the US the market is open 9-5 mon-fri. Crypto is open 24/7/365. If the market crashes HARD people may liquidate crypto assets to cover/shore up their stock positions. But because Crypto is also global there is access to theoretically more money to buy the dips, and since the market is SO MUCH smaller than the stock market, less money goes alot further in pumping it back up. BTC fell to 3k then within a month.. maybe? it was back at 8-10.","yes, there is some correlation especially short term. Which makes complete sense. If the stock portion of your portfolio crashes, the natural and smart thing, or in many cases the necessary thing to do is rebalance it, which means selling some of your other assets. Crypto and stock prices also depend on the same risk capital looking for a return and will both profit from low interest rates / high liquidity or suffer if/when interest rates go up.

Long term correlation is a different story, no one knows."

Get with the future and buy XRP," This  is all presupposed on the idea of Bitcoin as an investment.  Bitcoin  isn‚Äôt supposed to be an investment or a store of wealth, it‚Äôs a  currency.

It‚Äôs not going to be as  widely used as a currency while it is being treated as an investment.    You can‚Äôt have it both ways.  Either, like Cathie says, pension and  other funds will widely put a portion of assets into Bitcoin, or  institutions will widely accept it as tender.

Think  of it, and think of what intrinsic value there is in: a bar of gold, a  $1USD federal reserve note, a share of a dividend paying stock, a bond  certificate, and 1 Bitcoin.

Gold has industrial and physical uses.  It can be used to produce useful things.

USDs have the US government stating it must by law be acceptable as payment for all debts, public and private.

A  share of stock in a company is a legal entitlement to ownership of a  company with voting rights, rights other people see value in  controlling, and any dividends are additional returned value.

A bond certificate must be paid back, usually with interest.

A  Bitcoin can be used to make things... a Bitcoin is legally required to  be accepted as.... someone has to pay you for your.... um, other people  think a Bitcoin has value?

Look,  buy Bitcoin if you want, but it can‚Äôt be both an investment and a currency.  And the only utility of it is as a currency.  And if it‚Äôs a  currency, the central banks and their servants, the governments of the  world, have all possible means and reasons to not let their currency  powers be taken away from them.  Right now, 'investors' in Bitcoin may time it right, they may realize that a revaluation of Bitcoin is coming, or they will become bagholders in what might be the worst 'investment' of their life.

I mean, consider this.  One satoshi  is 1/100,000,000 Bitcoin, right?  Smallest delineation of a Bitcoin in  the current code.  Unless the community changes the code (which is a  whole new can of worms, the community being able to just change your  'store of wealth' at a whim) you can't go smaller.  So, you'd expect  Bitcoin to come to some valuation where one satoshi is valued use-ably.   Lets consider that in USD.   Lets say for simplicity sake we want one  satoshi to be equal to a cent, it would mean one Bitcoin is equal to  $1,000,000 USD.  THAT'S where people are getting this idea that one Bitcoin will approach valuations of a million USD.

But that's assuming Bitcoin is a currency!!!!  Without status as a currency, it has no value.",

No longer buying, just sell or hodl for dear life.","I've heard this argument a lot, would love to hear the response from the community:

Most cryptos are separate from their institutional use case. For example Ripple the company is separate from XRP. Ripple the company uses the same framework for the institutional transfer of funds cross border as XRP. But the XRP that retail investors are purchasing is separate from the pool that is being used for institutional money transfers. So there is no inherent value in purchasing XRP beyond speculation. Additionally, many cryptos have no current use case.","I only have regret , wished I invested in 2017 . Learned about cryptos on Reddit which I mostly used on manga and anime .  Now I am holding a portion of salary every month into cryptos."

The likes of Goldman Sachs artificially created $4500. People are fomo'ing in to ETH right now. Its dangerous

Im more interested on what quietly went sideways after the dip.  Thats the real story","ETH is obviously head and shoulders above BTC in terms of fundamentals but BTC has been the face of crypto for so long it will take a while before the general public sees it doesn‚Äôt actually have as much value/utility as other alternatives. But crypto is so complicated for the average person that this may either never happen or at least it could take a long time.

Crypto is different from the stock market where the average person can understand: ‚ÄúLet me invest in McDonalds. They sell burgers. They are everywhere. I like them.‚Äù Vs crypto is investing in complex software. That McDonalds investor won‚Äôt be able to immediately understand fundamental value in the same way in the crypto space: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to invest in polygon. Plasma side chains are the future.‚Äù Crypto requires technical knowledge to understand fundamentals. A lot of people even think bitcoin is synonymous with crypto! And until that changes, BTC will still do ok.

That being said, fundamentals should always still win in the long run. So while BTC may still be a safe bet for the foreseeable future - ETH is still the stronger and safer long term bet in my opinion.

This is definitely not happening ;)

I like Cardano a lot but lets separate the salesmanship from reality.  Charles does his job well but central banks are the most clever swines, historically speaking

What is more likely to fade away are smaller banks that still run on COBOL","Without going as far as the disappearance of central banks, it is quite possible to imagine a future world where a real alternative will exist allowing citizens to choose between an unjust system and a more respectful one.

1. Do not do this on a windows computer, windows has enough leaks as it is.
2. Do not do this on a computer connected to the internet, preferably do it on an amnesiac OS loaded from a USB stick and rebooted into oblivion
3. Storing on a USB stick is only fine if you plan to either power it frequently, or HODL for less than 5-10 years.  NAND Flash needs to be powered every now and then or it suffers from bitrot.  In the spirit of this, and assuming a strong enough password, i would opt for different types of hard to get into cloud storage provided as ancillary from a cloud service.

NFT ticketing definitely has advantage over traditional ticketing. I can see NFTs disrupting the sports ticketing market. Industry players like Mark Cuban are publicly advocating the benefits of NFT tickets.  
  
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/mark-cuban-dallas-mavericks-may-use-nfts-for-ticketing.html  
  
The benefits of NFT ticketing include integrating the primary and secondary market, preventing scalping and asking for royalties om fees. Furthermore, crypto collectibles could be added to the tickets for special moments of concert or sports game. Giving attendees collectors item.  
  
I expect NFT ticketing to become a major frontier of blockchain adoption. Forinstance, GET protocol has already sold 700k tickets on the blockchain and has whitelabel solution that allows ticketing companies to easily adopt the protocol.

Calls safemoon a memecoin. But if you look at what they're doing with the project they're doing some decent stuff. Thier own Exchange, safemoon wallet. The list goes on. Safemoon is only a few months old. The largest whale owns around 2% of total safemoon in circulation. This article seems like trash tbh. If anyone has any thoughts I open to learning.","I thought people will learn after bitconnect, i was wrong","Redistribution of tokens is a marketing scam and the average person is too dumb to realize it. To overcome a combined 20% tax when you buy and eventually sell, you would have to gain 20% or more of redistribution which in many cases means you have to hold for over 1 year. The longer the token has been out, the longer the new investor would have to hold to break even on the tax. If someone bought into SafeMoon today, I bet they would have to hold for over 5 years to get 20% of redistribution to overcome the tax. 

The only people benefiting from redistribution are people that get in presale, which they avoid the 10% buy tax and only need to overcome the 10% sell tax, and big whales who just hold and only sell the tokens they receive from redistribution. 99% of holders lose money because of the redistribution tax and they think they're making money."

As other posters said: learn to trade & create a strategy (it's the only way traders survive legacy markets and 24/7 crypto when they don't have a whole workday to trade):  
1. Take trading presumptions 

2. Backtest them (maybe find something out-of-the-box so you don't add too much on your plate while learning trading)

3. See what has potential

4. Work on that

Once you have a strategy you can automate it easily on CLEOone (solid backtester too), Haasonline, or something else depending on what you need.  If you don't want to use builders add coding to the things you need to learn.

It will take more time but you will be lerning a craft instead of stumbling in the dark."

A recent Gallup survey showed that 3 times as many American‚Äôs own Bitcoin today compared to 2018. Still, this only equates to 6% of Americans saying that they own Bitcoin (see the story). Here are a few innovations to increase these numbers dramatically and help Bitcoin move beyond the toddler stage to the adolescent stage.

Around the globe, Bitcoin is seeing a tremendous increase in confidence and embracement. S&P 500 companies, billionaires, sovereign nations, investors, and average people alike are starting to see the allure of having a mathematically based store of value with no central authority that can be purchased and held all over the globe. Many analysts and executives are clamoring for the price to increase upwards of $1 million per Bitcoin in the next decade. Here are a few ideas that could dramatically increase ownership and support these lofty predictions.

Changing the main designation from Bitcoin to a smaller measurement like a Megatoshi

The way that humans frame value and pricing is very emotional. Look at Kohls. Every piece of merchandise is on sale. They have the retail price on the tag and always have a sale going on. Not to mention coupons and other discounts that can lower prices. If people think that they are getting a good deal then they are typically happy.

Unfortunately, as Bitcoin‚Äôs price increases, it can have the opposite effect of sale pricing. People are afraid that they missed a good deal of $5,000 Bitcoin and refrain from purchasing because $40,000 seems like such a large overpriced figure. Human psychology tells us that Dogecoin valued at $0.21 only has to go to $1 to nearly 5X while Bitcoin would have to hit $200,000 for the same gains. Which seems easier, going to $1 or $200,000? Also if I have $500 to invest, would I rather have nearly 2,400 Doge or .0125 Bitcoin?

A Satoshi is only one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin so that measurement is a bit too small. I‚Äôd like to see a Megatoshi that is the equivalent of 10,000 Satoshis. Currently, a Megatoshi would be valued at just under $4. This is a figure that people can grasp and relate to. Instead of having a goal of 1 Bitcoin, I could focus on accumulating 1,000 Megatoshis. If I purchase 10 Megatoshi‚Äôs per week, I would accumulate 1 entire Bitcoin in less than 2 years.

As long as Bitcoin is priced at an unattainable number for the everyday person, it will turn away smaller investors and people who can‚Äôt get over the mathematics. Additionally, if Bitcoin is ever intended to be spent and used as a currency, having a Megatoshi price will be much easier than pricing in Satoshis or fractions/percentages of a Bitcoin.

2.¬†Government regulation

Earlier, I stated that Bitcoin is a toddler. Looking at its price movements we can see that it throws tantrums just like any three-year-old. Some days it behaves well and some days (or months) it behaves terribly. When it comes to Bitcoin, you almost need to expect the unexpected. And like an erratic toddler, Bitcoin needs rules.

Regulations are a scary thought because no one knows exactly what to expect. And regardless of what regulations do pass, there will be unhappy people on both sides. However, regulations will ultimately strengthen the thesis for owning and holding Bitcoin for three main reasons: 1) It further legitimizes the crypto space and shows that it is definitely here to stay 2) It makes the case for holding over a long term stronger 3) It eliminates one of the biggest arguments for not owning Bitcoin

Regulations and rules aren‚Äôt fun. However, we need more than 100 million people worldwide investing in Bitcoin for it to mature and sustain higher price levels.

3.¬†A Bitcoin retirement option

Most people don‚Äôt like their jobs. I could probably write 1000 articles on why they don‚Äôt like them. These same people want to retire someday. In the US, we have social security. Unfortunately, this program is not funded enough to provide a reasonable retirement for most people. And, as lives get longer, the funding for current retirement programs and pensions will dry up.

Right now, the stock market and 401K are the most accessible games in town. However, if there were a way that people could inject 1% of their earnings into a Bitcoin pool, this would benefit both the worker and Bitcoin. It would provide price stability, diversified ownership, and a steady inflow of money to Bitcoin.

Workers would see the greatest gains. They would now have access to the best-performing asset class of the past decade. They wouldn‚Äôt be entrenched in stocks, bonds, and cash. And they wouldn‚Äôt have a retirement option that is structurally tied to government policy. Inflation numbers won‚Äôt dictate payouts and people can finally store their monetary energy.

Bitcoin has a bright future as long as it continues onboarding new people. The system is at risk if it is completely controlled by the wealthy and the elite. It is one of the easiest ways for people to embrace their financial destiny and opt out of the inflate, borrow, and segregate policy we are stuck in today.

Hopefully, you have found these ideas interesting. If you have enjoyed them, please follow me as I mainly publish about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Also, if you have any feedback or thoughts, please include it in the responses. I‚Äôd be interested to hear your thoughts on how Bitcoin can go more mainstream.",,

Their volume is basically the price, so I assume theres only been a couple transactions.

What Is Gravitoken (GRV)?

Gravitoken (GRV) is a digital currency with an elastic supply mechanism ‚Äî it is mathematically calculated to increase in price every 8 hours, thus investments are protected by a constantly growing liquidity pool, which is responsible for strengthening the minimum price, aka the price floor, until it reaches a ceiling of $1,337,000 where it becomes a stablecoin.

The official website of the project indicates that a prerequisite for the creation of the token was the need for a cryptocurrency that can withstand market volatility, and the token is insured against volatility due to the liquidity pool (the developed formula adjusts the liquidity pool to create a stable minimum price level). The creators of Gravitoken guarantee a constant growth of GRV or ""DeFi gravity"" ‚Äî the cryptocurrency is calculated to increase in price by a minimum of 9.81% (every 8 hours).

According to the developers, the growth of GRV will continue until it reaches the target guaranteed value of $1,377,000. This amount will be derived from a 9.81% fee on each transaction, which goes to token buyback and burns, automatic liquidity pool algorithm and the marketing budget, at 3.27% respectively."

The amount of shorts vs longs is way too high compared to everything else. Monero is the only peer to peer digital cash that exists today.

Every sales pitch was trying to cover a slice of the market, but most had the same basic business strategy - and they failed when the bubble burst. Nobody remembers [boo.com](https://boo.com) or [pet.com](https://pet.com) any more, or why they did the things they did.

Even Yahoo is a distant ghost now.

But out of the ashes, the Googles and Facebooks of the world were born.

The same will happen with crypto - the meme coins and the low value corner-cases will drop out of the radar, and new and bigger projects will come together. NFTs will probably implode, with only those with clear artist's value, brand value surviving the bloodbath.","The greed is the same. Potential for big profits is apparent in blockchain. True website & a good idea . Some projects were able to make it thru & be profitable. I‚Äôm actually using dot com era as a cautionary tale - why I‚Äôm in Cardano & it‚Äôs associated cryptos.

Gary Genslers MIT lecture on Contracts has guest Lawrence Lessing - a contracts lawyer. He compares these two eras with the same type of greed / barely a project but worth a billion or more / thinking that a project will automatically solve big problems (ala smart contracts). 

I just go with (very lackluster dyor on my part I admit) good sensible projects doing good honest work - not alot of hype.",You can't compare .dot boom to NFT.

NIMIQ is a sleeping giant in my opinion, the fundamentals, while still developing look quite promising, but we're not here for that, we're here to look at squiggly lines and hope they morph into something, or is that just the LSD?  
Again, I'm just a baby ape, still sucking the mummas tit on TA. NIM chart is looking like it has a long-term upwards channel currently happening (blue).  
Then there are two other triangle patterns in play over the medium and short-terms.  
The Yellow is a slight ascending triangle, that is looking for a breakout in that $0.0103-$0.0105 range, if this happens it should pop, especially with the current market environment.  
The red is a rising wedge, which looks like it's about to breakout in the same range of the ascending triangle.  
MACD is not on the favourable side for these, however, the RSI is in oversold territory, meaning it should turn and have a decent run after that.  
IMO in the short-term, this should have a good run ahead of it. Long-term it will grow but won't be a major growth until some further fundamentals come to fruition.  
If you have time, check out NIMIQ's community on here or on their website. Has a good team and solid foundation to bridge the gap between fiat currency and using to buy goods in bricks and mortar store using NIM and your phone.  
\*Any feedback on this chart from more experienced chartists would be greatly appreciated.","Has anyone done a technical meta analysis - eg taken a whole bunch technical analysis and seen if long term it actually works (so as to remove confirmation bias) I remember reading recently some randomisation (puppy chosing which way to so or other such nonsense) outperformed all the best funds in the market.
This just looks like tea leaf reading, but I obviously could well be wrong.
Curious to see what evidence there is for TA.",Basic works the best. In the end it's pretty much all about risk management.

I ask myself this question myself. As soon as someone achieves significant results, we will immediately see. The main thing is to make web3 simple for the average person, and then everything will be","I'm honestly unsure.
The ""Metaverse"" has promise as a concept; we've seen how much people are willing to dive into games like WoW and SIMs to escape, we've seen eSports blow up and become a viable method of earning a living, we've seen people willing to spend fortunes on digital assets i.e buying skins etc as DLC.

The problem I have with the Metaverse is it's just not fun. Spend some time on these crypto games and you'll quickly get bored. There's little selling them other than they're crypto. Same for the Metaverse ideas. Second Life already exists, online forums exist, I can spend real cash already. 

I think there's going to be a rise of virtual / work from home jobs. Businesses will likely turn to online board meetings more and more but why would they want to tie themselves to a wild variable like crypto?
Businesses want clear and predictable numbers. Risks taken are usually only taken after intense assessment.",I think Metaverse from Facebook will probably go as much without crypto as possible. It's 1000% possible to develop it without a blockchain and I think having chains makes it just so much more unagile. They will want to adapt it quick when it rolls out to please the users more.

To fund a startup in order to achieve new developments in blockchain can be very profitable.

No matter the current level of inflation/interests, crypto world needs these developments to be done for many trends, specially for DeFi (TVL is growing big) and its apps like SwissBorg, Yield App, Celsius and Nexo that are built on a blockchain that operates independently. Smart Contract are also crucial to DeFi and they can't be stopped once released on the blockchain, but we still need much more development on that. It can be more expensive right now to fund these developments? Yes, but we need them asap.","I really love CRO and the whole crypto.com offering, it's considerably cheaper today than it was in November."

This competition is one of the healthiest things to happen in this market.,"Well said. We're growing fast, and the healthy competition would go a long way in making crypto better. Personally, I think Bsc is another great blockchain to look out for. I don't see them settling for the backseats behind their competitors. Only problem I think they've got is the extremely massive amounts of meme coins there. But then again, there's some really great projects coming up as well. Just came across one called HyperdexFinance today, and I couldn't be more impressed. Looking forward to more sweet innovations on all of these chains.",The next step would be blockchains merging together and working as one cohesive unit. Just as Superbots from the upbots platform that now enables the user to trade using bots on dexes. Merging or bridging Cexes and Dexes would have a great impact in the long run.,"I'm glad you said competition is healthy for some growth. Solana knew there will be need for an upgrade to their ecosystem else, they get redundant and same goes for ETH, though we all know of ETH's security

In the same vein, a lot of Layer 2 scaling protocols are springing up and I love the competition in seeing. LRC became quite popular this year, Immutable X and Nahmii are not left behind. They are all fighting for a spot at the top. Let the best take the spot that fits"

I truly despise the complete bullshit articles posted as news. These journalists are awful at their careers and should find something else they‚Äôre better at. 

The reason why Crypto is soaring today has nothing to do with Russia. Hedge funds, which have been bleeding for months, are loosing billions per quarter. They have been diving into crypto as a means to counter the losses on the stock market. Due to the naked shorting with certain stocks, It‚Äôs more feasible to keep stocks shorted and use crypto gains to cover naked shorting fees (if they‚Äôre even paying the fees). There is a relationship with the naked shorted stocks and crypto. As one price increases, the other decreases. NEVER will both rise together. One of the two must be shorted to keep the wheels moving.",What has reassured the market is that America will not go for ground intervention in Ukraine in my opinion.

I‚Äôve invested a lot in LINK and DIA which are long-term investments and plan to buy more. DIA has made a lot of achievements recently, and after it got listed on Coinbase, Huobi, Cryptocom, that affected the price also, as well as after it made a lot of partnerships.

I am thinking of investing in DIA NFTs too. DIA recently launched Alpha pool, which rewards art holders with DIA tokens, a great opportunity for passive income.","I suggest buying some SOL along with some DOT, as well as some really promising low caps like PKR, FUFU, and MPL, to ensure that you are well-positioned for the next bull run.

What's piquing your interest rn fellas?,"I'm a software engineer (but a beginner in blockchain development) and interested in new ideas on digital wallets.

This lead me to RadixDLT (XRD). Since the project allows developers to use XRD's defi libraries and the Radix Engine to build their own DApps, it opens up a world of innovation from people with ideas. More developers contributing, more potential to find gems. I like to use Scrypto (to learn for now) for accessing Radix engine because it is written in Rust language and documentation is just \[chef's kiss\].

This is just an oversimplification but it is very robust and I'm definitely looking forward to that project's future and the developers using their ecosystem like myself.

Another gem which is very new but will offer another neat wallet idea is RoboInu Finance (RBIF). The person who started it was an ex-Google developer, and passed to an experienced software project lead, and she's been kicking ass, in my opinion. Since I'm really into community and collaboration, RBIF's culture has captured my interest. It's not about hyping, it's not about pumping, but about nourishing the community by continued support and offering solutions. RBIF has a special place in my heart. lol

The 2 products/solutions I'm very interested about are their flagship RoboWallet and RoboLaunchpad (which aligns with my interest for collaboration).

RadixDLT is already a mature project while RoboInu Finance is still very very new. I think financially, you can gain a lot from RBIF in a year or 2. ;)","I‚Äôm an $RBIF holder, happy to see it recommended here. Ms. Vy, the lead dev knows her stuff and has connections in all the right places. She is building utility and not interested in getting a hype pump. The hype will come when the utility is delivered and the utility will carry the project into the long term. 

The first prototype of the Robo wallet is anticipated in April. The big point of differentiation with Robo wallet is that it will support cross border transactions. Send crypto and have the recipient receive fiat in their native currency!",I too think the robowallet from RBIF will be a game changer.  I love the idea of being able to convert crypto to any native fiat without the mess of exchanges or uniswap.

Invest in projects that not only have solid fundamentals but also have a good marketing strategy. This is just as critical to a project‚Äôs success as it‚Äôs tech.

Thanks for the write up on stable coins. I was deciding which one is the best to use from now on because I don‚Äôt trust USDT after it dropped to 96 cents.,">Paper backed stabled coins such as USDT inherit more counterparty and regulatory risk than I am comfortable with. Given they are backed by US dollars, they have a single point of failure. They exist only if current administration within the US government allows them to exist.

>Call me paranoid, but I would not be surprised at all to wake up and hear that some patriotically named bill passed in the middle of the night regulating these types of coins effectively illegal.

What would a scenario like this look like? Would the US government actually do something like, for example, confiscating the funds backing these tokens, or forbidding anyone from exchanging them for dollars? Would they order them to use their freeze functionality to lock down everything in defi apps like Uniswap?

The author describes DAI as a hedge against this risk. I like DAI but not convinced about it working for this purpose. It came very close to collapsing a few years ago when Ethereum lost half its value and crashed under $100. They decided to reinforce it by... adding centrally backed assets, mostly stablecoins, [as collateral](https://daistats.com/#/), which are now the majority of it. Considering such a cataclysmic event as the overnight death of USDC and USDT would also cause a massive Ethereum crash, it seems highly unlikely that DAI would be able to retain value when those coins do not.

I don't think sudden erratic action to wipe out the wealth of a whole class of investors is really their style though; seems more likely that any harmful regulation will be of the slow and insidious type, though this could be wrong.","You should check out r/superstonk

You might get lucky and make a few good trades, but it's much harder in a bear market. Now is the time to slowly accumulate with funds you can afford and wait for the bulls to come home.","There is no legit group. Stop looking for an easy way out and start learning to read the market yourself if you want to make money shuffling numbers on a computer. It's a lot of hard work, and you'll probably lose money the first 1-2 years. If that's not for you go look for some other hard work you can do and get paid for."

Let me hear your thoughts.","As far as the price of bitcoin, I believe it may go up, but in fact it also may go down","If you look on any time frame, particularly on the 6 monthly which is what I'm looking at now, BTC has just experienced it's first ever bearish engulfing candle (preceded by a gravestone doji). I would say that no matter what happens in the next few days, that the next year is going to be not great for Bitcoin at all.

Additionally, if you look at BTC overall on a longer timeframe, it looks like it's formed an Elliott wave pattern and has struggled to reach previous gains in this bull market run, ultimately having two attempts and failing, which appears as though it is running out of steam somewhat.

All these things coupled with a bleak outlook for financial markets ahead make me think that we may go further down, and for longer, than most people think.

If that does happen, I for one, will be ready with some dry powder to buy as much BTC and ETH as I can when we get near something that looks like a bottom. I should add that I'm actually buying a little now as well, just in case.","Down to 17K, and will show resistance at that level.

That 74$ was a lesson in spread.,"It's not a fee, it's a spread. 


It's not like when your shopping for milk and the price displayed is exactly the price you will pay. The price you see on the app and exchange is the last traded price, the difference between the bid and ask price is called the spread, when you trade from the app (any app, not only cdc) you pay the spread. If you don't want to pay the spread, you need to use an actual exchange and then make traded at the price you want (and pay the fees).

The app is there for convenience, but it's not a substitute for using an actual exchange, you will never get the same price as if you bought on the exchange.

Here's an explanation of different fees and spread

Lemme explain you:

Basing on what you said, this AI alerts you if there is an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù variation of price on the tokens/cryptocurrencies you follow.
If that‚Äôs what it does, i can simply take a software that sends me an alert everyday at a certain specific hour (or any other interval of time) and see if the price has changed myself‚Ä¶


However that would be different if the AI is smarter and would suggest me what to do basing on its predictions‚Ä¶
Oh dear, the more accurate it is the better!!
More people would pay for it!!

But if you had a so accurate app you wouldn‚Äôt set it public, traders make money on the mistakes of others‚Ä¶
It would be much more beneficial to keep it for yourself.","If you find it useful, it doesn't matter if someone (or majority) don't. But I think you should give it the try and see what will happen. Maybe boom maybe nothing, but you should definitely give it a try."

AT THIS POINT crypto is a gamble, not an investment. There is no intrinsic value and the legal uses to which it is being applied aren't many beyond anonymous purchasing of porn services.
If you don't keep your ledger information in your own (preferably hardware)  wallet, you don't own your crypto, only someone's promise to pay, which is subject to bankruptcy if funds are hacked or embezzled.
If there are potentially many trillions of a particular coin, holding even significant numbers of them will never make you ""Lambo"" rich as you are at the mercy of the ""whales"" taking profits if the market rises. BTC maintains some value by having a maximum of 21 million coins, over 90% of which have already been issued.  
You can't just ""hold"" and ignore coins for years.  You will need to keep track of forks and exploits requiring wallet updates, etc. to keep your coins accessible or face major problems in the future.","Financial system basics

That's not how someone engages honestly, you're just trying to mislead people.

For readers, here's my reply from the deleted thread:


It might be an unpopular opinion, but it's certainly not 'realistic'. The comparison doesn't make sense... and in fact just reads like Polygon shilling.

The security for The Beacon Chain comes from thousands of people operating hundreds of thousands of validators.

In comparison, Polygon is secured by what, 100 validators? They make commits to Ethereum, because it's a more secure chain.

You're misrepresenting the comparison to try and make Polygon PoS seem more legitimate. If your point was valid, why would they be putting so much emphasis on developing rollups?

Assuming we cross off the value of the software part of the company and the debt we are left with $1.4 billion in debt and $2.9 billion in Bitcoin. This means we have $1.5 billion in net Bitcoin and the stock is at $3.6 billion. Assuming there is no change to the value of the software part of the company you could buy Bitcoin and short micro strategy and make free money as the gap closes. You can‚Äôt do this however because there are no available shares to short because all the big hedge funds and institutions are already shorting all of the shares and buying Bitcoin to hedge. 

The people holding/buying microstrategy at these prices are essentially handing over money to the hedge funds. If Bitcoin sky rockets it could still produce good returns but the returns will be worse than if you just held Bitcoin.",Crypto IRA investing has gained popularity as one of the best investment options available to people on retirement plans.,

Noticed that with many new projects. It's either they're building on Arbitrum for cheap fees & high throughput or on Polygon. Those will surely gain users & traction as long their products get delivered as promised.","High gas fees are the only thing that keeps DeFi safe and honest. 

Trying to remove them is dumb af. I want them higher.

The blacklisting sentence is not retroactive and doesn't require anyone to refuse transactions from people who touched TC.

2. Project teams and commentators overreacted and are still overreacting. It looks like everybody tries to exaggerate the situation to **make up** this drama. I guess that some are happy to FUD Ethereum while others hope to prompt a relieving reply from the American government.

3. There exists mixers for BTC too. If a censorship were enforced, Bitcoin miners would be asked to comply as well as Ethereum stakers. _Edit:_ last year, after an OFAC blacklisting of Bitcoin adresses, [some Bitcoin miners overreacted too and started to censor transactions](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/07/marathon-miners-have-started-censoring-bitcoin-transactions-heres-what-that-means).

4. Over the years, the FBI arrested several times criminals who stole BTC or used it to sell drugs. The court never required miners to freeze addresses. Why would it be different with Ethereum?

Telos' performance is unmatched in the industry and has been specially designed to deliver speed, scalability, affordability, decentralization and fairness to the end user.  
Telos offers a developer grant program that provides developers with all the tools they need to create successful and valuable projects.  
The program helps you develop with:  
\- TLOS Token Grants to help you finance your project  
\- Easily accessible documentation and resources to simplify your trip  
\- Direct access to Telos team members and mentors during creation  
\- Introductions to thought leaders, VCs and ecosystem partners as your project evolves  
All on the best network there is for:  
\- SPEED and SCALABILITY: The Telos blockchain can support up to 10,000 TPS and block times of 0.5 seconds, providing the necessary foundation to make your project work at the speed of light.  
\- CONVENIENCE: With a zero-fee native smart contract tier and an EVM tier with fixed transaction fees of less than $ 0.10, Telos offers the most competitive cost structure in the market. Our technology allows you to encourage more users to use your dApp without having to worry about high and variable transaction fees.  
\- EQUITY: Because we are able to produce blocks every 0.5 seconds and ensure first-in-first-out transaction processing, Telos eliminates operations in advance and creates a fair environment for all users. We believe this is a key requirement for attracting wide adoption in the crypto space and will attract new users to the ecosystem.  
\- EASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Our EVM is backward compatible, allowing developers to use the entire Solidity toolchain to easily create dApps and write smart contracts. If you can build in Solidity, you can build on Telos.  
In order to enter the program, you must fill out the application at the following site https://ignite.telos.net/forms/grant-application-origin-form",,

They offer between 18% APY to 299% APY. The only noticeable con in staking is the lock-in period.","Staking is definitely a safer option, especially with an asset that isn't currently in use. However, I'll admit that I find trading a lot more exciting. There's the thrills, the big wins and the loses and I find that to be really exciting. My recent journey in macro trading has been really smooth and I think I've developed a knack for it. Maybe it's because of the much higher leverage I'm allowed to utilize on TakePile. I just know it seems to work out almost perfectly these days. Hopefully, it's all roses from here. Even though I know that rarely happens.","I prefer staking to trading often, as many FAs and TAs will be performed on a token that can result in a loss of up to 80% in the hopes of becoming a diamond hand in leverage trading.

Rather than straining myself with all of that, a wiser solution for DeFi users continues to emerge as a large number of staked tokens like as JUNO, Osmo, Atom, in specific quantities to a validator qualifies for the validator's tokens. However, RIDE and Green are worthwhile as they offer above 25% APR. The only visible disadvantage of staking is the lock duration, which makes it uncomfortable yet far superior to trading IMO."
