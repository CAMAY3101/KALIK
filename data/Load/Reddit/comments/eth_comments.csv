10/1/2019,dbruyz,4,/r/ethereum/comments/dbruyz/gradbase_putting_qualifications_on_the_ethereum/,45,ethereum,Gradbase putting qualifications on the Ethereum Blockchain,In my opinion I think this is a very solid use case.,"This is indeed a very good use case of Blockchain technology in general.

The qualification verification procedures of today are dire. If you wanted to verify the authenticity of a degree or work experience you would in 99.9% of cases know who/what office to contact at the issuing institution. This is before you take into account the eventual language barrier and international payment that may have to be made. Moreover, every institution uses their own method (typically slow and manual) to accept requests and fulfil them. I've seen companies not perform employee checks at all because the system is simply impossible to navigate.

This is because there is zero standardisation in this sector, and all data is stored in different siloed databases at the institution's end.

At a talk in London, UK last year, Vitalik expressed his support for using Ethereum to solve this problem, in particular to check if qualifications have been revoked. Amplifying the discourse to qualification verification in general, whatever method you decide to use technically, storing hashes or encrypted digests of qualification data on a public, robust, decentralised ledger allows every verifying body to instantly verify the validity of qualification data with the same standardised experience all over the world.

You can then start thinking about building a user-friendly mechanism to make the process easy for the lay person. In Gradbase's case, this is a QR code to be added to CV/LinkedIn, but I have seen digital certificates and mobile apps too.

I feel this application of Blockchain is fairly underrated, yet think it will ultimately come to be one of those that will survive all hypes and march on long into the future. Only time will tell; in the meantime I wish all the companies in this particular field the very best of luck.",So is TiiQu [https://tiiqu.com/blockchain-based-certification/](https://tiiqu.com/blockchain-based-certification/) .

Can someone help ELI5 what I actually get out of it and how I can judge the value I'm providing? 

Last I heard/understood, pooling my tokens was more valuable if there was high volume, low volatility (lots of swaps without big price swings). Is there a way for me to account for that? Is there a historical chart of the value of the pool tokens? Or do I just need to keep track of what I put in and what I can take out at any one time? (That's a low bar to clear).",,

First, it's very cumbersome to use, and only works for larger chunks of data. It's not going to make sense in a lot of accounting style use cases like an ERC20 contract, a DEX contract, etc.

Second, it may actually be cheaper to store data this way. `SLOAD` gets more expensive as the size of a state trie increases, but Ethereum doesn't have just one state trie. There's one state trie that has all of the Ethereum accounts, hashes of their code, their balances, their state trie root, and a couple other values. Then, each contract has its own state trie that contains the contract code and other storage data. By the time you're executing a contract's code in the EVM you've already looked up its state root, so if SLOADS are going up overtime it's because contracts have bigger state tries of their own, not because the overall Ethereum state has grown.

So storing data in the code of a contract means you have to look up that contract in the top level state trie, then look up one value in a state trie that only has one value. You only have to navigate the state trie once, and it's a small state trie, so the lookup goes fairly quickly even if the stored value is larger.

While this seems counter-intuitive and mispriced, it actually may not be.","IstaNbul. Sorry, couldn't resist. :)

This actually makes Nexo feel better at this moment: you can only get a loan for 50% of the value of your ETH, so $2000 worth of ETH is needed for a $1000 loan. The market would then need to drop by 50% for your ETH to get liquidated. This is really safe imo, and safer than the CDP ( though i bet you can add more ETH into the CDP and just not take out the entire value into a loan of DAI ). on Nexo the interest is just 8% if you pay with Nexo tokens, and the tokens themselves can be used to reduce the chance of your position being liquidated, while also providing a dividend! However , in the future if your interest rate on a $1000 loan would be something like 5% or lower, that would be pretty sick.",

It's not a concern for mainnet forks, because core devs cannot compete with current hashpower to push a fork.  
  
It may be a concern for PoS. As I believe (could be wrong) that Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation still control a lot of ether.

As for future contentious forks: they'd end up in a chainsplit.

The issue I believe is that in a voting system, you do not want people to be able to prove to someone else for whom they have voted, because this means that people can buy votes or coerce votes (in current systems, if someone pays you, you can just take the money and vote for whatever you want, and the person paying you won't be able to tell if you indeed voted what he wanted). Maybe this might be solved in the future with things like zkproofs and the like, but I am no expert.  But this is not an ""easy"" problem.","because of the security issues inherent in elections, and lack of common understanding of how to secure a private key/mobile device, I'd expect a long wait before this becomes common for national elections in developed nations. 

That said, there's a good opportunity to start building the technology for things like ""\[your country here\] Has Talent"" competitions or even corporate elections, given some regulatory maneuvering.","I’ve considered the thought since Ethereum launched.

Imo, voting on the Blockchain would require a complete overhaul of our identification systems. I always thought something like this *could* work if your SSN or state license/ID generated a private key and public address. 

Registering to vote could be a public transaction to a smart contract, in which you get a token to vote in return. Contact could be setup to freeze transactions until voting day / release tokens on voting day, or release tokens once you verify identity at the voting booths. 

Wallets could be set up for candidates. Token could be deflationary upon transfers (think bomb token), and voting for a candidate could require a minimum token amount  that’s equal to exactly 1 transaction of the token from your wallet. This way a token would be rendered useless if transferred to another person who tries voting with your issued token, as that token wouldn’t meet the minimum amount to transact. Simple UI design at the voting booths could circumvent this as well - issue token upon verification at voting booth, token is released to your wallet at voting booth, and you’re only given options to send a vote to valid candidate address. 

Only problem here is you’d have trust the government could setup a secure smart contract. And you’d have to trust private key issuance and verification has been done fairly. Government would also need to log real identities associated with public addresses, and you’d have to trust they logged that securely - vote transactions should be public so anyone could tally votes, and you cannot have the public finding out identities associated with public addresses, as who you vote for must remain private. Tbh, I’d find it difficult to trust gov’t in any of these aspects."

Next year needs full audio/video support of each talk throughout Devcon, not just the main stage and on Days 1-4. Whether it’s live streamed or just uploaded later that day is a separate question, but this needs to be part of the offering next year. It’s pretty embarrassing how this was an oversight at a TECH conference.","Obviously, there are many things our Ethereum community is doing right and well. 

When it comes to the Devcon, the entire world's eye is on us. It is a way to onboard 10,000s of new developers. You just need to look at the crypto price rally which really began on Monday in anticipation of Devcon and continuing even now shows how beloved and well everyone thinks of our Etherum community.

I think despite some harsh comments I think our community simply feels like a better location could have been chosen. Some of the things that will need to be considered going forward are:

1.) Considerable time needs to be spent on choosing an awesome location and venue. I mean a team needs to vet and go through all possible sites and locations and consider all aspects of the location as in housing availability, transportation, meals, broadband availability, lots of bright open spaces with a view a plus, etc.

2.) Major investment and operation towards professionally streaming live all talks, all rooms, all interviews and have it all available to view 24/7. 

3.) Personalized badges and security pass neck chains need to be dispensed during registration. I have an idea of why they ran out of meals. Catered food service needs to be provided just like in Prague. No one should go hungry at a Devcon.","London.
Shanghai.
Cancun.
Prague.
Osaka.
...Americas.

It's the Devcon pattern. I think the idea is to be inclusive and not host the event in the same place every year. 
There are way more Japanese people attending this year than last... and maybe next year there will be more South Americans.

I think the venue could have been better, and I agree that Prague seemed better in term of facilities and infrastructure... but the talks here are great, the conversations are great, the people are great. I'm glad I'm here and I'll try to go again next year, wherever it is."

The VDF randomness upgrade requires VDF evaluators to run VDF hardware. Those evaluators are orthogonal to validators. In other words validators do not need to be evaluators, and evaluators do not need to be validators.

We need just one honest and online VDF evaluator in the world for the VDF-based upgrade to work properly (otherwise the security of the randomness decays to the underlying RANDAO). To ensure this, we intend to give away thousands of VDF rigs to Ethereans and beyond around the world.","Good question, I always assumed the VDF's would be ran by the validators.","Ok so it goes like this on the last reveal:

1) the last revealer has some amount of time to reveal or not. This time will be less than the theoretical fastest time to run the VDF. If they decide not to reveal or time runs out, they submit a 0 (as an example). 

2) This last bit of entropy is combined with the rest of the entropy from the commit reveal. 

3) Anyone running the VDF can begin to evaluate the final combined entropy and get a result. 

4) once submitted this can be trivially verified as correct by the validators or really anyone running a node.

5) we have created unbiasable randomness on the assumption of at least on honest Randdao participant and that there can’t be an asic above a certain speed.

I'm not so sure.

Keep in mind that most of the tokens representing our DeFi apps (e.g. DAI and the cTokens) will be pretty easily sendable across shards once the token contracts are upgraded to allow for that. So, for instance, there's no inherent reason that Maker and Compound would need to be on the same shard.

In practice, only contracts that are *tightly coupled through function calls between each other* might necessarily need to be on the same shard. Contracts that are *loosely coupled through tokens* can live on separate shards just fine, and ""communicate"" indirectly through users sending tokens cross-shard.

Imagine a theoretical flow like this:

1. User 1 draws DAI from MakerDAO, which lives on Shard A.
2. User 1 sends DAI to Shard B.
3. User 1 lends DAI on Compound, which lives on Shard B.
4. User 2 borrows DAI from Compound on Shard B.
5. User 2 sends DAI to whatever other DeFi app living on whatever other shard they want.

It all works fine cross-shard like this, no? As long as the contracts depend only on tokens and not on cross-contract calls.

Edit: [Posted this in the daily, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/dgrax4/daily_general_discussion_october_12_2019/f3isb4v/)","Cool to see my talk inspired people 🙇🏼‍♀️

But the Parity multisig wallet didn't hit many individuals, just a few *prominient* individuals, so it was easier for the grassroots to resist. I fear MakerDAO has enough small users in it that the grassroots might be willing to trade Ethereum's integrity for cash once more.

On the other hand, the TheDAO hack had a time delay built into it. The fork was able to be deployed before the hacker was able to withdraw the Ether and sell it off. It might be harder to force a fork through if the Ether's already flooded out into the rest of the ecosystem and into innumerable other wallets and contracts - you'd either have to roll back weeks of transactions (a non-starter) or you'd have to mint a huge amount of new Ether out of nothing to restore the MakerDAO balances.

These guys are an obvious me-too cash grab masquerading as a decentralized system. A quick glance at their API confirms that 90% of their functionality involves ways to send them money.

BUT. How on earth can ENS publish this article with a clear conscience? It seems that when ENS created a TLD ""outside of the ICANN process"" they were ""good citizens"" running a harmless ""experiment"" to benefit users and ""prove the technology"". But when anyone else does the exact same bloody thing, they are ""damaging the long-term success of blockchain-based naming"" with their ""flagrant unwillingness to respect the procedures developed by the global Internet community"".

Maybe ENS has forgotten (it's mentioned nowhere in this post or their website), but their entire concept is itself a rip-off of Namecoin's .bit TLD.

Or how about the fact that the success of the .eth TLD (""one of the most successful new gTLDs on the Internet"") was the result of a deceptive bait-and-switch scheme? Originally .eth domains were reserved by depositing ETH which could later be redeemed if you no longer wanted the domain. But after significant adoption, wallet integrations, etc, ENS then switched it so you have to pay yearly fees in perpetuity, with the profits conveniently flowing to ENS Domains Inc.

About the ICANN ass-kissing in this article, this is a contemptible attempt to pull the ladder up after themselves by putting themselves into a privileged position ahead of other blockchain naming efforts. And the DNSSEC solution they propose is an insult to the entire crypto community, it being basically a [government takeover of the internet's cryptosystem](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/).

First, both participants in an atomic swap must be active at the same time. Atomic swaps must be negotiated between two parties through a multi-step process during which both must be online. You can't just post an order for an off-chain atomic swap and come back later to see that it has executed.

The other aspect is that contracts can't ""hold"" an atomic swap like they can tokens. For example, WBTC is accepted as a token on Compound. You can borrow it against your other collateral, or collateralize it and borrow against it. Compound can't be a participant in an atomic swap. Atomic swaps require both participants to to have visibility to both chains, and compound's contracts only exist on the ETH chain. There's simply no way to use an atomic swap as a collateralized asset, since an atomic swap is a transaction and not an asset.

Once you've tokenized an asset you open up a lot of possibilities. You can trade it trustlessly by posting an order and then going offline. You can hold it in contracts with complex rules about how it can be used. You can collateralize it for decentralized lending. Atomic swaps just get you trustless trades - tokenization brings a lot more to the table.","You can keep it in an ETH wallet, and you can send it a lot faster too."

Ah, I imagine it must be a wonderful event discussing technology with you, no prejudice, just fact-based arguing for the best of the company, isn't it....  
Totally makes sense to ask this question completely biased here (and in /r/ethtrader, haha) to really make sure you stay in your bubble, nothing to see here, just move on.... 
 
Just to risk some karma and to show you why management will most likely take the external advice and not yours: what industry are you working for? what kind of projects will need DLTs? why is a public/permissioned/corsortia or ""decentralized"" solution necessary and to what degree? what requirements are there and what regulatory contraints have to be adhered to in your industry?  

Can you imaging that if Corda or Ethereum or Oracle or SAP or Microservices or ESB or even SOA make sense actually depend on several factors and that using public permissionless Ethereum Mainnet might not be the best solution (in terms of Scalability, Privacy, Usability, Upgradebility...) for all use cases on earth? There are several use cases in finance where Corda fits much better than Ethereum, because Corda was created with finance in mind. One day Ethereum will hopefully be the better solution for most of those cases, but today, it just isn't. This is not about technology, just date a lawyer from your company, explain her what probabilistic confirmation means and what immutability and who actually really confirms a transaction in a PoW setting and let her compare it to Corda or any other permissioned UTXO DLT implementation. That would actually make sense to build your own opinion, but beware, it might not fit your already manifested opinion very well.",

Yes, technically anyone else could create their own ENS service, just like anyone else can create their own DNS network and try to compete with normal DNS.

Regarding support, take a look at the official website https://ens.domains/

ENS is adopted by all major wallets, and 2 out of 7 root key holders are members of the EF.","ENS and unstoppable domains are only available in the ‘blockchain’ space, these domains can resolve IPFS websites, with the exception of .eth names which can also resolve .onion domains. 

Smith.eth, smith.com, and smith.xyz can co-exists. Just like name.com and name.net can co-exist.  .com and .xyz can resolve normal websites like reddit.com, while .eth can only resolve IPFS and .onion sites.  The .eth extension is reserved by ICANN for Ethiopia and if Ethiopia decides to start selling domains... well they can. The have the rights to do so. 

Next what ENS is looking to achieve, is enabling most TLDs to be used the same way one would use .eth names. 

I’ll put some links later because this is F confusing.

The reason for this is that ENS is defined as official [EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-137.md) and that EIPs also have official registry and resolver addresses specified.

Of course you can set up custom domain system with `.eth` TLD. But nobody will be using it as resolution process is handled by contract address and not by TLD. And because all wallets use official addresses, your custom system won't work."

Interestingly enough, this client is 100% compatible with the ethereum main net.

Not only will these private nets eventually (maybe) migrate on to the public main net, but also they can sync with it while their private net is being used, and publish some of that data to the public.

They're many reasons why these private nets are important and (according to some) a necessary step in the right direction for companies to start embracing blockchain. Some are privacy concerns, immaturity of the tech and space in general, and speed (much higher TPS with a private net using another consensus algorithm). So these organizations are just waiting to see where this goes, others may just not need a public synced network. Consortiums come to mind with the latter.

> Do they all use Solidity?

I'd note that this flips and becomes an incentive to increase issuance if and when current issuance is not sufficient to secure the network. The presumption that issuance will only ever decrease is not a safe one.

Overall though, it seems like a reasonably well thought out policy to ensure smooth operation of the platform, but nothing more. The mere fact that there is uncertainty over monetary policy while one of the primary breakthroughs of BTC was the first example of a commodity with a mathematical assurance of scarcity puts them in entirely different classes.

On top of that, you're also arguing from a less than neutral POV when your comparing the worst case scenario for BTC (issuance isnt sufficient to secure, and must rise) to the best case scenario for ETH (issuance is more than sufficient to secure, and will fall.)

I'd also suggest that posing ETH 2 as any sort of means to increase security is being grossly ignorant of the enormous dangers in fixing something that is not broken for mission critical systems. Ask boeing how their latest software upgrade went. There's a reason you have nuclear launch facilities using computers with 5.25 floppy disks and banks running their backends on ancient mainframes. It's not because it's cheaper, its because introducing any new variables into a system with a long track record of stability is asking for trouble.

The way they are developing Ethereum makes it almost completely unsuitable for use as a serious store of value. It may make a good or better means of exchange or unit of account, but they're pretty much throwing the digital store of value use case out of the window. The risk of catastrophic failure is astronomically high compared to BTC.  That's fine for cryptokitties and Web 3.0. Also fine for low value hot wallets and transient transactions. Not fine for global reserve currency.

The simplicity of BTC isn't just a narrative, it is practically a law of nature that complexity and security are fundamentally opposed to each other. The continued tinkering and changing of Ethereum so overwhelmingly undermines it's security that any added or lost security due to issuance is a negligible rounding error. You can't build a fortress on quicksand.",Now let’s talk about security and hashrate growth in comparison with each other 😜,"You should've compared to, for example, Cardanos monetary policy because Bitcoin is too different from Ethereum (PoW vs PoS, different vision/goals). Cardanos monetary policy is very similar to Bitcoins. It has a fixed supply and staking will be incentivized by minting new ADA plus transaction fees. And once all the supply is minted staking costs and incentives will be paid with only transaction fees.

&#x200B;

You either pay for network security through transaction fees or through inflation. I, a laymen, think I would prefer paying through transaction fees. This just seems more fair to me and less likely to be abused for financial gain like in the current fiat system (simpler is probably better in this case (?)). But I guess both will work just fine. I just don't see any huge upsides to inflation that make me think Ethereums monetary policy is 'underrated' (maybe compared to bitcoin but that is an unfair comparison imo)."

**Technical Details**

The dapp is purely smart contracts based. Users can directly access the dapp using wallets such as Metamask, Trust, or Coinbase wallet without having to create an account on the dapp itself.

When an order is placed by a buyer, it goes into an orderbook and funds are locked in an escrow contract. Sellers can see all orders on the orderbook, and choose which ones they want to fulfill.

Seller fulfill orders by inputing the code for the giftcard corresponding to the order. The code is encrypted with the buyer's public key.

Once an order is filled, the buyer will be notified and can view the code by decrypting with his private key.

Throughout the transactions, no personal data is provided by either parties.

**Avoiding Spam**

To avoid spam and fraudulent activities, sellers will need to deposit a stake equivalencing to a portion of the order price. The stake will then be held in escrow for a period of time.

If the buyer finds the code inputed to be invalid or purchased through fraudulent methods, he/she can initiate a dispute by depositing the same amount of stake.

Once a dispute is initiated, the platform will intervene as a third party to resolve the dispute based on evidence provided by both side of the transaction. And the winner of the dispute takes all the stake in escrow. We plan to make this process more distributed in the future and allows for decentralized resolution of disputes with some incentivization mechanism in place.

**Avoiding Fraud**

To avoid transaction of fraudulently purchased cards (e.g giftcards purchased by stolen credit cards), all cards must be purchased by cash. Failing to provide evidence of  cash receipt and physical card will result in loss of dispute for sellers.

Any feedback is appreciated!",Interesting idea. Though I feel like the difficult part is finding people that are willing to sell giftcards for crypto at significant discounts.,"It's a cool idea so I hate to say this but I agree with /u/uint256: I don't think people generally care about privacy enough to pay a premium.

For those preferring a quick TL;DR, here is an attempt (although I recommend reading the blogpost if you find any of the points below interesting):

* Meetup.com is the home of over 1 million Ethereans and recently it surprised many people with an overnight pricing change later named a “test”
* The total value extracted from the Ethereum community alone in this new pricing model would touch **$3 million USD** yearly
* Since Meetup.com was bought by WeWork and WeWork is going through some really hard times now, the future of the Ethereum meetup community is uncertain
* Ethereum is a unique mix of financial, technological and social capital.
* It seems like there might be a correlation between these 3 forms of capital.
* An Ethereum meetup exodus would bring with it community fragmentation and a big blow to Ethereum's current social capital.
* We can do something about this together and maybe trigger in the process a “social capital flippening” resulting in Ethereum becoming the #1 blockchain community in the world.
* The Ethereum community is at a point where it can take control of its destiny by leveraging its existent technological and financial capital to increase its social capital
* Since it appears that there is some correlation between the 3 forms of capital, an increase in social capital could lead also to increased financial and technological capital

[At DEVCON 5 we presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaMXa6R-jyI) what is possible with what has become known as “AKASHA Reloaded” - a social media framework enabling the creation of interoperable social media networks enhanced by blockchain technology.

Quadratic voting itself is a novel way for academic nerds to confuse the voting public and is more or less the last thing anyone wants or needs (see the endless fiddling with ranked ballots and the like).

I can understand that some people are following Ethereum only for speculations and don’t really know/understand much about software and blockchain development, and thus might not be familiar with concepts like Proof of Concept or Minimum Viable Product... But only in the US would people use an acronym to racially profile people.","The negative comments are very surprising and, frankly, enraging.

Firstly, they don't seem to know what a Proof of Concept is, it certainly is not a finished product, it just showcases a certain technical relationship as being possible. Not needed, not mandatory, but theoretically possible. This is how technological progress is achieved, btw.

Secondly, the UX of blockchain is terrible and only a tiny subset of technically able people use it and that is not likely to change if things are left as they are. I develop on top of Ethereum and even I don't want to take out my hardware wallet unless it is absolutely necessary (so like once a year). Too much is at stake and it's too easy to make a mistake and lose everything. Account recovery is one of the most under-researched topics so don't shit on people who are trying to improve the situation through experimentation.

Thirdly, if you knew something about account recovery you'd know that there are clever schemes (used by Argent for example) that allow you to recover by using a set of co-signers: a friend, a hardware wallet, the company that made the wallet. The scheme of signing via a an existing auth provider potentially gives you one more option - a real world account you already have, making on-boarding easier without sacrificing decentralization and making things more secure in the process.","This is an interesting gadget, as long as google's JWT website sign on functionality is maintained and continues to work how it's supposed to."

Most sports betting is done with a different system called ""fixed odds"" betting. This is generally considered superior since players will know the odds they are receiving at the time they place their bets, as opposed to parimutuel betting where the odds will change depending on subsequent betting activity. We wrote some more about this here:

[https://medium.com/@Degens/desirable-aspects-of-sports-betting-dapps-6aef34a0713a](https://medium.com/@Degens/desirable-aspects-of-sports-betting-dapps-6aef34a0713a)

Parimutuel is not really compatible with in-play betting either. In your system, why don't I just wait until the 90th minute before placing my bet, when the result is practically certain?

It seems you are implying that pooled betting is more peer-to-peer than fixed odds bets, which is not necessarily true. Our site [SportCrypt](https://sportcrypt.com) has been offering fixed-odds peer-to-peer sports betting on the Ethereum mainnet since 2017.

In the absence of fee market reform won't an increase in the gas limit just make low-end fees cheaper, attract more transactions and make the state bigger? (This may be a good thing in its own right but that's not what's being pitched here.)",Ethereums been fine for me lately as is.

What could happen, now sure entirely. There is a chance, however small, of secret ASIC miners double spending as PoS approaches or suddently switching to another ETHash pool during the transition and dropping hash rate which would endanger the security of the Eth 1.0 chain.

These are pro-progpow arguments that I heard few times before and it doesn't really makes sense to me.

* Why would miners attack the network? Wouldn't this decrease the price and their profit? This is so short term view even for the miners.

* Chips that are constantly mining don't last long and **the big investment** argument is really weak. They all know PoS, lifespan of the chips. If they decide to invest that is their calculated risk.

* GPU miners may not want to lose their investment to PoS too.

* The most efficient ones can switch to ETC if it is profitable.","i think a better approach is to counter their arguments. than to accuse them of threatening you. or saying you feel pressured.

for example, do you refute the audits they cite in their blog?

In the short term this issue is being tackled with eth 1.x. There are proposals to implement state rent / pruning. The idea is that storage could require an ongoing supply of eth to hold on to (paying rent). If you stop paying rent for the storage allocated by your contract, nodes can delete the data associated with it. This wouldn't mean it's necessarily perminately deleted, you could resubmit the data later (if you kept it) along with more rent and nodes would store it again. This plan has raised concerns about censorship resistance though. 


In the long term we're using sharding so nodes will not have to store the entire chain. The current plan is to start with 64 shards and increase to ~1024 shards in 10 years. This will have the same effect as if the blockchain today was 170 MB. That buys a significant amount of time for storage technology to improve. It's not guaranteed that storage capacity will continue to scale with the growth of the blockchain.


Comparing to Google is retarded. To be decentralized, blockchains must run on commodity hardware. Yeah we could blow up the state to thousands of terabytes so that only a few datacenters could store it but that defeats the whole point.

Also worth noting that storage on Ethereum is (rightfully) NOT cheap. Last time I did the calculation it was around $1000 / MB.",[deleted],Is youtube not sustainable in the long run because people won't stop uploading videos?

You'll need access to an Ethereum 1 feed (which could come from infura or a local node), and you'll need to run a beacon chain (the Eth 2 chain), and an instance of the validator client. Since no data is being processed on the chain for Phase 0 you won't need additional storage hardware and the processing load will be relatively light - this will change in the future as transactions and contracts are implemented in Eth 2.

The ""rule of thumb"" that I've heard and kind of like is:

1 validator can run on a RPi4 or a cheap laptop.

10 validators can run on a decent home PC.

100 validators will run on a server.

There is no way to be certain how this will all pan out until client development is done and the multi-client testnet launches (realistically in Q1 2020). Even then we'll see different performance profiles for different staking clients.

The transactions are sudo anonymous since anyone can make a ETH address but that isn't the same as anonymous.  If the ETH was bought in an exchange then they probably have a copy of your ID and such.  Which allows them to trace alll transactions back to you.  This is the exact reason Monero and Zcash and Grim invented.  There are plans in the works to allow anonymous transactions but they haven't been implemented yet. Also,  you are going to pay a fee no matter what you do.  That's how this all works.","You could use a tumbler but you'd have to pay fees, that's the best option.

This was outlined on the hardware audit for ProgPOW. Before the axes come up... hear me out. 

Full disclosure: I do help out maintain a GPU farm for a friend of mine. He's got 2500+ GPUs. We did experimented on ASICs (some  handful of mix E3s and A10s but nothing major). Even with free power, we have to turn off some rigs as we need additional cooling for the summer period at the moment.

The birth of AMAPs like the Hyperminer from Xtend renders any efforts to defend ETH's POW useless. It uses a very efficient decentralized memory which can do 16x perf of a GPU on ETHASH and 8x on ProgPOW. Forget ASICs. Team Green got their own variant of this that they will not release to the general public. Kristy-Leigh Minehan  (aka OhGodAGirl who scammed many customers and colleagues at Mineority) is in Team Green's payroll. Hence, the vow to get ProgPow implemented Ethereum - I will not trust her even with a used toothpick (see the bolded footer on this post).


Proof as per u/Killit_Witfya from thread https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/dx95tc/coinbase_comes_out_against_progpow/ (thanks for pointing this out BTW):
> good. we don't need giant mining farms trying to sabotage proof of stake to help their bottom line. in case you don't know what im talking about core scientific (heavy ties with progpow) finally unveiled their new ETH mining facility last week https://cryptobit.media/en/news/mining/2724/ some of us sniffed this out from the beginning and got chastised for being pro-asic


If we all receive this with an open mind, you will see that the future platform where Web 3.0 will be built on is in danger from corporate capture. I am not alone on this. There are devs that have expressed similar train of thought. So while we all want to get more from participation, we simply cannot ignore the fact that all the bigotry only fuels those who want to ruin the best things about Ethereum.

With all the above, we can safely say that ETH sorely needs to move away from POW. This makes ProgPOW a waste of resources - an unnecessary distraction. Yes - this is true even if there's a separate team maintaining the POW chain. Can you imagine if those resources are further allocated to get POS going?

Our best bet would be to support the move to POS - Even that is under attack. People are insinuating that ETH's classification under Serenity will be changed to a security rather than a commodity when the reality is that the change in the underlying consensus have no bearing on ETH's utility/use (aka that portion stays the same).

For what its worth, there are some people turning around and realizing that ProgPOW is not good for ETH. Take the top reply in: https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/9mhb4i/progpow_overclocks/
The poster intended that document to have the benchmarks for ProgPOW. He's now edited it to contain the reasons not to implement ProgPOW.

Hopefully, some constructive criticism:

1. At several spots I could tell you were reading off to the side. Maybe put it closer to the camera? Above it maybe? I'm not sure what tricks other YouTubers use other than a full on teleprompter.

1. The intro highlights your sexuality, which is cool if that's what you're aiming for. I'm not trying to gatekeep you, just noting that you will aquire a different kind of audience if you keep it platonic and technical Vs. sensual/playful news.

1. English is good, only a few tiny mistakes that any native speaker should easily figure out what you meant. That said, at a few spots, the background music was a tiny bit too loud to parse the accent and hear you at the same time. As a general rule, I might suggest that you want soft/no beat type music when talking technical stuff since each word is more important to hear than general news which is less information dense.

1. In person, when talking about Ether, I never hear anyone say ""EEE TEE ACHE"". I personally switch between ""EE TH"" and ""EH TH"".

1. Presale price was 33 cents, but the price changed over time. The later buyers got a worse price than the early buyers over the 42 day sale. Also, Bitcoin at the same time was crashing and started it's major bear market.

1. Something soooooooo technical you and your audience probably don't care about, but I'll mention anyway, is that ""Solidity"" is not what is run inside smart contracts on Ethereum. I mention it because Solidity may not be the big thing forever. In ETH1.x (current version) Solidity is a programming language that is translated (compiled) into EVM bytecode (Ethereum Virtual Machine language). In the upcoming ETH2.0, Solidity will be translated down to eWASM (Ethereum WASM [Web Assembly]).

There are much, much less used languages like Vyper and Formality and people's pet projects that can also be compiled/translated into EVM or later eWASM bytecode and run on chain as smart contracts without Solidity being involved. Sorry, not wanting to be pedantic, but future updates/news will make more sense if you understand this piece of the puzzle.

1. Ooohhh, last nitpick ;-) TheDAO hardfork was ""an irregular state change"" that moved funds out of the ""DarkDAO contract address"" and into the ""Whitehat group DAORefund contract"". This is different than *erasing the theft*. So the Ethereum fork did not revert or erase transactions in the functional sense, you can still see everything that happened on Etherscan if you like. It was just the hardfork added a transaction that transferred funds from the DarkDAO to the recovery address, without the DarkDAO actually signing that transaction (we stole from the thief, we didn't erase history of the theft).

1. Ok, the actually last point is, again on an Ethereum Classic note... We have a feature in the chain called the Difficulty Bomb which causes an ""Ice Age"" and freezes the blockchain if it doesn't get removed or pushed back by regular hardforks. The Homestead version of Ethereum has long since frozen and cannot be restarted without a hardfork. TheDAO Hardfork that created Ethereum Classic has done the same. Basically all previous versions of Ethereum (every hardfork) have frozen and died.

Ethereum Classic's chain today is not the literal same chain as Ethereum's before TheDAO Hardfork. Ethereum Classic has also needed to do hardforks to remove/delay the Difficulty Bomb.

Hardforks are kinda like the parable of Theseus' boat
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus which is the Ethereum Chain? If every piece is changed one by one, but always called Ethereum...

Anyways, congrats of the first video, looking forward to more!",This feels like a softcore porn intro than an introduction to Ethereum.

Is this possible?

Are you saying a contract that will self execute after some variable is met, such as block number, asset valuation, oracle feed, ....? If so, I think no, though you could allow for the action to be called and inturn executed by anyone for a small reward once the variable is met, which would mean not relying on a small group of humans (who would benefit some such an event being performed by the smart contract) but relying on a bigger network of humans (as a small reward is paid out) - an example of this setup would be [ChronoLOGIC](https://chronologic.network/) alarm clock contracts.

> Are there any tutorials about this?

Depending on what you want to do, there are many abstract tutorials that you could adapt into exactly what you want. For example, [how to build a time locked smart contract wallet](https://medium.com/bitfwd/time-locked-wallets-an-introduction-to-ethereum-smart-contracts-3dfccac0673c)

> I'm So sorry, for the newbie question, just don't know where to learn exactly what a smart contract is capable of autonomously.

No need to be so apologetic, Ethereum is all about building, learning, and helping eachother ;)","Yes. A smart contract has an address just like a regular Ethereum user. To have a contract hold an ERC20 token, just transfer it to the contract's address. The contract will then be allowed to transfer the ERC20 token (via the contract code)",

Eth2 at this point has nothing to do with the ice age. No eth2 dev is even considering this as a factor. 

On top of that, eth2 doesn’t even require a fork of eth1. 

Issuance has nothing to do with the difficulty bomb.","What? It was already delayed few times, what a weird narrative.

The exchanges and users would have to decide which one to use, or whether to keep both alive. At the moment of the split, there would be identical ETH in each fork, so you would double the number of ETH you have.

Such a scenario is highly unlikely. The more likely result is an ""official"" chain that the EF is working on, and a different chain that slowly dies away, like ETC.","Hardfork means a new version of software which isn't fully compatible with the old version.

Contentious means the community is split on whether to use the new version.

The software network updates a database, which stores your eth and is stored on everyone's machines.

What happens is there will now be two networks and two databases, both show you have 1 ""eth"" and updates will not cross contaminate.

It's called a fork because 1 database in 2 databases out.",

Beware of anyone promising more.

&#x200B;

Why? Because it is all supply and demand. If you borrow DAI/USDC, you are betting you will be able to return it at a cheaper rate, i.e. ETH will go up. If you borrow ETH, you are betting it will go down. There are way way more people locking up ETH as collateral than people betting against ETH, this means that borrowing is cheap.

Here's my experience:

1. Author(s) write EIP and gets through Last Call.
2. All technical objections must be overcome. There are hard blockers, i.e. something can't work. For example EIP-1191 is a great idea. but it's written wrong, it can't be passed.
3. The author request promote from Last Call.
4. The author exhibits to the EIP Editors a list of all objections/comments and the resolution for each. Here is what that looks like: [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1170](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1170)
5. Whichever EIP editor that is available looks for any problems and then accepts it.

Note that nowhere is there a check for whether this is a good idea. This is intentional and good. There is no community consensus. Again this is good. You don't need consensus to write up blueprints, you just need good blueprints.

\---

Once Ethereum 2.0 is deployed a different library will be used:
https://www.parity.io/why-libp2p/","You creat your tx (transaction) , send it to a node ,maybe your local node, maybe a remote node, it doesn't change the thing. The first call is made between your client (metamask, web3 library, any other client) using usually json rpc protocol over http, most of the time but can be web socket or IPC. Then your transaction, if your node is not a miner, is broadcasted to the other nodes connected to your node. We call them peers. The broadcast of the tx is made first by encoding the data in a format called RLP. The data is sent to all your peers in this format using the P2P protocol over TCP. Once received by the peers, it's added to their tx pool and either added to a block if they are miners or just forwarded the same way using p2p until it reaches a node that will mine a block and include it in this mined block. Note that P2P is also used for discovery of peers, but using UDP. Hope that helps. Don't hesitate to ask for details.",If you know the OSI model. Then you should know which layer the software that is used by the ethererum network runs on.

I found that there quite a knowledge rift between developers on these three platforms, which is why I wrote this article.

In all seriousness, in response to [this previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ean389/delay_of_the_ice_age_and_its_implications/) on /r/Ethereum and other conversations on reddit and twitter regarding a large surge of community support for an issuance reduction to accompany the next hard fork that delays the ice age for another 1.7 years, some prominent individuals in the space have [expressed reluctance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtUFoKA9-Rg&feature=youtu.be) for reducing issuance at this time over fears about weakening security of the Ethereum 1.x chain.

Instead, there seems to be a consensus forming among the gatekeepers and developers that we should instead drive Serenity to completion as swiftly as possible so that there can ultimately be a **meaningful** reduction in issuance.

And I'd like to throw my support behind that effort if that is where some long-time Ethereum thinkers and developers are leaning.  I hope this is genuine--out of a desire to move to POS as soon as possible, and not because of some kind of capture by the miners.  My instinct tells me that the developers are sincere about this.  For the good of the broader community, let's all hope that they are, and that the choice is sound, because if Phase 0 slips into Q2 2020, there will be a lot of unhappy people with ETH issuance back above 4.5%/year, while BTC issuance rate drops to near single digits around the same time.  On the other hand, if Phase 0 is launched in Q1 as projected, the whole narrative around the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH issuance will change, and for the positive.",,

""Scarcity"" is not a source of value in itself. All arguments for the supposed worth of bitcoin, the halvening and the rest also apply to litecoin equally. Try to explain why they don't work for ltc.  

PoW is much more centralizing than PoS because it's exclusionary: if I can mine 2% cheaper per hash than you, I'm going to grow until you're forced to either stop or mine at a loss. As a result, mining centralizes without limit: already most of hash power is in China.  
There's no such dynamic in properly set PoS, so the network can stay decentralized for eternity.",[deleted],"> 3) PoS is naturally centralizing as the stakers do not have costs so once you have a good chunk of the coins it is impossible to dethrone you.

As I understand it, the current design for Ethereum PoS causes the rate of return to go down as more Ether in total is staked (eg, if 5% of all Ether is staked there's a 10% return, if 6% of all Ether is staked there's a 9% return, etc. - numbers just made up off the top of my head to illustrate). The purpose of this is to limit the total size of the stake relative to the ecosystem as a whole, ensuring that there's always a large amount of liquid Ether sloshing around in the market.

So assuming I'm remembering and understanding that correctly, it should always be possible for new stakers to find a pile of Ether to buy to dethrone a dominant staker assuming they're okay with smaller return on investment. Not perfect, but not ""impossible.""

And they will. Several things will happen:

1) Some will fork ETH, again. They have nothing to lose by doing so, unless there is a place for them in ETH 2.0. Believe it or not there are people out there that believe PoW is superior to PoS, and believe that you don’t fix something mission critical that isn’t broken. So they’ll keep the old chain alive, and it’ll probably be as relevant as BCH is to BTC until ETH 2.0 has had a few years to prove its a suitable replacement. This will prob hurt the ETH price. 

2) Some will go mine ETC or something else, but non-miners don’t seem to understand that this is essentially trying to pour a bucket of hash into a few thimbles of other coins. There’s nowhere near enough capacity outside of ETH. But ETC will def get a huge hashrate bump, it’ll suddenly seem more relevant than ever, and if anything there will be a “war” between the old ETC and the new fork. These coins are going to be relevant, and they will suck a lot of attention away from ETH. It will probably not be good for the ETH price. 

3) Since so much extra hashpower will be unleashed looking for something to do, some big miners will probably attack and double spend other altcoins. Again, the question to ask here isn’t “why?” but rather “why not?” They’ll have zero incentive left to be honest, because the only chain big enough to handle them just kicked them to the curb. Just like a starving man won’t hesitate to steal, neither will a dying mega mining farm. Since we all know fundamentals matter a lot less than sentiment, and eth is still an altcoin, the altcoin chaos will probably not be good for the price of ETH. 

It’s going to be a very interesting transition. I will probably sell whatever ETH I have left and watch from the sidelines, because short term it’s going to be ugly.","That's why Golem was interesting, it planned on recycling all GPUs to do useful computation when switch to pos happen.

You can make proofs for pretty much any statement of this form.

In fact, if you want you can even do something even more powerful with multi-party computation: Alice and Bob together figure out the number of 1's with A XOR B (the protocol inherently guarantees correct execution) without Alice or Bob party needing to see both vectors.",You lost me at Alice and Bob.,"Maybe some special trick exists, but I would just use zokrates or circom, or other circuit compiler.  
First Alice needs to commit to a hash of A, then Bob sends B, then Alice generates a proof for two public inputs: B and hash of A, that she knows the hash preimage (ie. A) and that the number of ones after xoring A with B is x.  

The answer itself inevitably leaks information and can allow reconstruction of A in some cases, but I assume that's not a concern here (random bitstrings?)."

1/11/2020,enjrup,34,/r/ethereum/comments/enjrup/does_ethereums_value_go_up_from_ethereum_based/,1,ethereum,Does ethereum's value go up from ethereum based tokens?,"In theory it should, since you need Eth to pay for gas. In practice it does not help that almost every single token in useless.","Yes and no.

First, in order to get a meaningful answer to this question, you need to establish exactly what you mean by ""Ethereum"" or ""Ethereum's value"". Depending on your perspective, Ethereum the platform may provide ""value"" to you as a user, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the trading price of ETH (the token/coin) will rise. For the rest of this comment, I'll assume you're referring to ETH the coin experiencing price appreciation when you ask ""Does Ethereum's value go up"".

Token contract operations require ETH to be used (as gas) in order to occur, so if a huge quantity of token transfers (or other token-related events) take place, this will reduce the available supply of ETH. However, this alone is probably not going to be sufficient to prop up the price, because relatively little ETH is needed to cover the gas costs of most operations. What may have more of a positive (if indirect) impact on the ETH price is the network effect fostered by its role as the host chain for these tokens. This is a less tangible and trickier-to-reason-about aspect, but basically the idea is that projects building atop Ethereum (and their users) have natural incentives to promote and support Ethereum (and to some degree ETH), and in general more mindshare translates to competitive advantage in the market.","Theoretically? Yes. Practically? Not yet.

In theory, because ETH is the basis for all Ethereum dApps, and gas is needed to make those apps work, then more dApps should theoretically bring in more users, and consequently lift the price, right?

Not yet. As other users have pointed out, dApps are generally not yet useful for much, so the user bases are extremely limited- this has a minimal impact on ETH's price, certainly less than overall inflation. Additionally, and more significantly, tokens actually have a parasitic effect overall on ETH's price- by selling ETH to get GNT for example, ETH becomes less valuable overall- an increase in a token's value does not necessarily mean a commensurate rise in Ethereum's price."

A bit of a personal back story first.

After recovering from a critical health condition due to tampered blood tests and reporting, I started hacking on Ethereum to see if I could leverage the tech to solve this for others. When building a couple of prototypes and eventually my first side project [CryptoVigil](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7iebpe/i_built_cryptovigil_a_telegram_bot_to/) on Ethereum, I realized how painful it was to code on blockchain even for an experienced developer like me. Why wasn't there a Stripe or Twilio for blockchain that I could use to quickly prototype my app with just a few lines of code. With that vision, my co-founder @Anomit and I have been working on this since 2 years.

Whether you are a student, a novice in the world of web development or a seasoned fullstack developer, our vision is to make blockchain development accessible to all. The tutorial framework itself will be open sourced once we collect feedback from the community and iron out a few kinks.  Anyone can then contribute their lesson plans and spin off their own version if they wish so.

Would love to hear first impressions from fellow developers here. Feel free to break stuff on the interface too 😉

(It is a developer tool intended for desktop usage. Experience on a mobile browser will be sub-par.) 💻

If you want to dig deeper, check out the [docs](https://ethvigil.com/docs) of the core API. We dog-fooded it to build this very experience!",,

(Is Aave legit?),"I don't have any experience with Aave but I do have experience with Compound and Celsius. Never had a problem with withdrawing my funds. If you're interested, check out these two videos I made about them. I also made a video about how you can find out more with regards to earning interest on your crypto:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkgMkv-gcUA&list=PLzBkR7WI\_by0rDMRXhQ9Qwp-kZtuKnuoe&index=3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkgMkv-gcUA&list=PLzBkR7WI_by0rDMRXhQ9Qwp-kZtuKnuoe&index=3)","aave is formerly ethlend and they are very legit, they have security audits as well. https://blog.openzeppelin.com/aave-protocol-audit-summary/","Never heard of Aave, and I'm not 100% sure how smart contract lending totally works. But yes, the interest you are paid comes from the people to take out loans. The model is no different than a bank savings account. Though your deposits aren't FDIC insured. And I think banks additionally use your money to invest (not just lending) which provides another source of income to pay you, that I don't believe these lending programs do.  
  
My thoughts on investing in a stablecoin is negative. The interest rates are higher, but you also aren't exposed anymore to the price volatility if you convert your ether to USDC to invest. Meaning, if the ether price goes up, you don't benefit from that, because your stablecoin will always be 1:1. So, in my current opinion, it's more rewarding to invest crypto into these programs, even though the interest rates are lower.  
  
Additionally, the interest rates are variable, and need to be. Let me explain why. The lending works on supply and demand. If there are more people depositing then there are people taking out loans, then there is less money to pay interest on deposits, meaning they need to lower the interest rate to stay afloat. Additionally, they can lower the interest rates on the lending side to attract more people to take out loans... increasing demand and bringing in new loan money to pay the depositors.  
  
So if you calculate the compound interest for 5 years, you probably won't make as much as you calculated. Because I believe interest rates will go down over time, simply because less people will want to take out loans. I think right now, loaning in booming, because there are a lot of people with ideas that want to build businesses in this space and need loans to start up. But that will wind down in time. There is a reason bank deposit interest rates are so low these days, and I believe that is an effect of economy running it's course and that the same will hold true for crypto.

There are also a lot of people with crypto just sitting around not earning them value, especially during ""crypto winter"" so these loaning services provide a way for those people to make money during that time."

During these two weeks, Eth2 teams were working assiduously. Significant progress with development was made. Eth2 Implementers call took place. Eth2Stats is live and now has the Saphire and Lighthouse testnets. Lighthouse update #21 is now out: new fork choice algorithm, 10x faster and more stable syncing, 32x database storage reduction and much more in this update! Another large Eth2 update from the PryLabs team was published. The highlight? More than double the validators expected at mainnet launch already running in the testnet! The team also significantly improved the Eth2 testnet block sync time — going from 0.2 blocks per second to over 20 blocks per second in just two weeks! Furthermore, the Nimbus team has been awarded a follow-up grant from the Ethereum Foundation to continue work on the public multi-client ready testnest, prep for production use, and more engineers who can broaden the scope of work to key new areas. Geth v1.9.10 — light client checkpoint oracle, higher propagated transaction cap, bug fixes, Parity v2.7.1, Nethermind v1.5.8 released.

Runtime Verification has successfully completed a formal verification of the Eth2 deposit contract. This contract is responsible for handling the locking of ETH on the eth1 chain, and then minting of ETH on the eth2 chain to allow for staking.

Eth 2 is coming! Get ready to stake in 2020! Check out “Understanding the validator lifecycle” article by Jim McDonald, which examines the validator lifecycle in-depth, showing what happens in each state and transition, what triggers transitions, and how long each transition takes. “Staking On Ethereum 2.0 — What You Need To Know” interview featuring RocketPool explains everything you need to know about the coming changes and how you can stake ETH to earn rewards by securing the new ETH 2.0 blockchain.

I could be wrong on some things though so feel free to correct me:

So from my understand this is how it works, I’m just gonna use fake numbers here. 

1) He borrowed $10 from ethereum using the flash loan meaning it was practically a free loan. 

2) He sent $5 to bzx and opened a short position. I’m not familiar with bzx either but I’m sure it handles shorts like really any other platform. So he opens the position that will make him money if wbtc goes down. (I can go into detail on how this happens but it usually has to do with selling someone else’s share with the agreement you will pay back the share in the future.). Bzx allows you to trade on margin so if you put in $5 of btc you can short 5x that on margin. But if the price goes up at all while your position is open you can be liquidated and lose all the btc you had to cover the position. Kind of confusing but it’s how a lot of loans in defi work. So if you have a $5 short margined 5x then you actually have a $25 short position. The way this makes sense for both parties is that if the price went up $1 then $1x$5 would mean the entire short position would have to be liquidated. People doing this are counting on the fact that the price will go down. If the price goes down $1 then you can make $5 if you close it right away. There’s other factors at play here like you would be liquidated way before your position loses its coverage. 

3) He sent the other $5 to compound and took out a loan from compound. This is similar as bzx but going the opposite way. So you put in $5 of ethereum and get a $4 loan of bitcoin. If the price of ethereum decreases so that your $5 turns to $4 then your position gets liquidated to cover the loan you took on bitcoin.  

4) He transfers the $4 in bitcoin to uniswap. Not 100% sure on this but I believe Uniswap works by just having pools of currency. If a large amount is transferred to the pool of a certain currency then the price will go down. It’s possible to crash any price especially on a small market like uniswap provided you have enough currency. Here 112 btc was certainly enough to lower the price enough for the persons short. Its important to note bzx used only uniswaps price feed to determine what the price is for shorts. 

5) The price of bitcoin dropped so he was easily able to close his leveraged short position.  So the price of bitcoin went from $4 to $3. His short position was leveraged 5x so he made $4 per bitcoin he has. He lost $1 from the bitcoin he was actually holding going down $1 but gained $5 from the leveraged short position he had. 

6) He then takes the money he made from the short position and buys ethereum to pay back his original flash loan. He keeps whatever his profit is. 

This all works because of a few things. Flash loans which give you the original ethereum at basically no cost. Margin shorting which allows you to multiply how far your dollar is going. Bzx fucking up and only using a small protocol for the price feed.","""Hacker"""

When I came out to make rounds, grab snacks, or visit the facilities, I was overwhelmed by the noise and confusion of it all. My impression was that despite there being a lot going on, it wasn’t very well organized.","I used to work with Adobe Flex, so I attended a lot of their Max conferences. They were massive - 15,000 attended the last one - and they were so much more smoothly run. Aside from the daily kickoff in one large room, where they completely blow your mind with an impressive audio/video/speaker presentation, the individual presos were given in separate rooms so distraction was kept to a minimum. You could choose the presentations you wanted to attend ahead of time and get a customized schedule that you followed so you didn’t continually have to walk around looking for something to grab your attention or consult a big list of everything going on to decide what to do next. You never worried that you were missing something important because you weren’t on the ball. In ETHDenver I felt like a tourist. At a Max conference, I felt like a student. Coming home from ETHDenver, I felt like I was returning home from a road trip to an out of state rave - fun but ultimately just another experience. Coming home from Max I was always excited to put what I’d learned to good use.

I had the same experience at NFT.NYC just a few days later. Noisy, crowded, impossible to focus on anything, even a conversation, for more than five minutes. Like being shouted at by barkers at a carnival."

* You provide your account address (if you want the HoloCard, that is) so the QR printout can be created. No other info than the address itself is needed.

Miners should move forward with it anyway,"This really isn't practically possible.   A hard fork of this nature needs complete community support.

If miners go for it , then of course whatever ASICs that are there are going to resist, right?  We can't accuse them of doing whatever it takes to stop POS and not also do whatever it takes to stop ProgPOW, since to them the outcomes are the same.

So, what we end up with is the original chain still running along, and a new ProgPOW chain running along side it.  One of them will have a head-start and the other will lag, but both will eventually be running and both will have value.  Because crypto-economics.

That is at least a certainty.  How should every other participant in the network plan to behave?


They are going to be forced to make choices.  In order to prevent all hell from breaking loose they actually have to make these choices *before* the fork, not knowing how it's going to turn out.  Because they too have to expect that an unknown number of ASICs are going to continue forward. 

And this is where your userid should guide you. 

But I'll lay it out just in case.  Wallets: at least one wallet will choose to support both.  Firstly, because nobody knows in advance which side wins.  It would suck to choose the wrong side and have no way to support the other one. Second, it's technically the easiest and makes picking the winner a moot point.  More important, users will want it because math: both sides of a persistent fork have some value.  Some plus some is more than some.   

And at least one exchange will support both (because money). 

And it may not be a polar split:  some GPU miners might even be better off mining on the existing chain than following the ProgPOW chain, this would depend on the relative fraction of ASICs currently, and the relative price of the two chains. 

And presto.  Two live chains.  Likely with different prices.   

Which leads to one more wrinkle.   DeFi.  We don't have to dive too far down into that rabbit hole to realize the mind boggling cornucopia of issues that could arise there.  Even with replay protection.  Which *everyone* will have to build in.

The possibility of a contentious fork makes it a very big deal. It's not just a miner decision.  It's an everyone decision.",,

You can fork a project as much as you want and git will keep track of it all. What it won't do is pick out any particular branch of that history. You have to give some particular person the right to select the official branch. 

Bitcoin invented a decentralized way to do that automatically. That's what solved the doublespending problem and allowed Bitcoin to implement money.

Ethereum's smart contracts extended that to other things besides account balances. It lets us all agree on the current state of arbitrary software running on a decentralized network. That's not something git is capable of.","The fatal flaw in the original quote is that it leaves out the operative word, ""decentralized"", thereby being circular.

A chain of blocks _is_ just a merkle tree. A _decentralized_ merkle tree involves decentralized consensus, and that involves the mining and the transactions and the cryptocurrency rewards. The whole thing is a game theoretic engine that forces millions or billions of strangers to mathematically agree to something, which creates value.

The whole point of ""blockchain"" isn't that you can't change the data inside, the whole point is that millions or billions of people agree that you can't change the data inside. That is magic. 

A git repo sitting on a dot com does not allow millions or billions of strangers to agree, but a blockchain does.

The technology is also a philosophy about how society can use digital networks. You earn ""network points"" by helping the network do tasks. In return you spend those network points in the network to other people who care about the health of the network. It's a mutually beneficial relationship that also happens to have all these cool mathematically secure properties.

It's a masterpiece, to be honest. That is if it turns out to actually work ;).","99% of the time when someone says blockchain they're selling snake oil. So it is easy to understand the sentiment.

The idea that those technologies are useful but that combined with other technologies (specifically blockchain but could be anything) is ridiculous. But the idea that blockchain is some magic bullet is also ridiculous and more prevalent.

The commenter is talking about convenience and the fact that less technical people will not adopt this stuff, ignoring the fact that these tools are there to be used by those who have use for them, not to become a panacea (insistence of ""adoption at all cost"" moonbois to the contrary).

The context of the argument has merit. The argument itself doesn't really.

I'd like to see the commenter come up with another way to work around the byzantine generals problem. I'd also like to see more than 50% of blockchain implementations actually solve any problem with one."

3/6/2020,feo3gl,64,/r/ethereum/comments/feo3gl/progpow/,1,ethereum,ProgPOW,"Good answer already if you meant what is the controversy... However, assuming you mean the recent bug, this is a vastly over-simplified explanation.   Because it's complicated.  The details are here: https://github.com/kik/progpow-exploit 

Proof of Work is a race to figure out the right ""nonce"" for a block.  Whoever comes up with the right nonce first wins. 

Finding the right nonce consists of a steeplechase through memory:  you choose a nonce.  You hash it and that gives you an index in memory.  You read a chunk of memory from this index, you hash it, and that tells you were to read next, and so on...  You do this a certain number of times and you end up with a hash.  If the hash meets the right conditions, the nonce ""solves"" the block.   If not, you go back, pick another nonce, and do this steeplechase over again. 

This is ""memory hard"", because each time through the steeplechase you have to read from a lot of memory.  Reading from memory takes a lot of time.   So you can be pretty sure that whoever solved the nonce spent a lot of time and energy running around reading memory. 

Even more vastly simplified, in this algorithm you start with the question and go looking until you get the right answer.   And you know you have the right answer when you hash the question and get the answer. 

However, there is another way to solve this puzzle, which is essentially to come up with the answer first, and then guess which question will fit!        

In this case all you do is randomly pick questions, hash them, and if they give you the answer, you meet the criteria for a ""solved"" block.   And hashing, especially inside an ASIC, is much, much faster than traipsing through memory!  

Which of these two ways is actually the fastest depends in part on the size of the hash. 

If the hash is only 4 bits, you can guess all of the possible combinations in 16 guesses, and on average you only need to go through half of them before you get it right, so 8 guesses.  NO question this would be the fastest way.

But if the hash is 256 bits, the sun would cool before even an ASIC could guess half of them.  

Both ETHHash and ProgPOW work this way. So that's not the bug.

ETHHash uses a 256 bit hash (a sun-will-cool size number), which means that in ETHHash, the right way is the only practical way. 

ProgPOW however, they decided they would cut it back to 64 bits, because GPUs like using 64-bit registers, and, well, you know, the algorithm was designed to fit GPUs.

While not a small enough number for you or I to count in a lifetime, 64 bits is a small enough search space that a set of ASICs could easily solve it much faster than the memory steeplechase.    

So it turns out that ProgPOW was actually EASIER to optimize using an ASIC than ETHHash!!
 
Oops!","It's fairly complicated because it involves a cross section of the Ethereum community, including miners, developers, users, DAPPs, investors, etc.  Basically, it is a controversial proposal to switch the current POW consensus mechanism to a different POW consensus mechanism in the name of leveling the field for GPU miners and ASIC miners.

There have been several problems with the implementation, which hasn't engendered much trust, and most of the user community has serious and legitimate concerns about making such a fundamental change to the protocol, particularly just as ETH 2.0 is getting off the ground.

There has been some movement toward a compromise in which PP would be used--at most--as a sword of Damocles with a strong Schelling point.  In my opinion, the Schelling point should be one that both sides of the debate have vocally expressed concerns about--that ASICs might somehow try to prevent the switch to full POS. **That** should be Schelling point, nothing more and nothing less.",#🐸🐾

There's are reasons nobody has done blockchain car rental yet. You would need:

* A car with an internet-connected smart lock, so that the renter could get in without physically meeting the owner to get a key (unless it's okay to you that the renter would need to physically meet the owner)

* A company providing permissionless car insurance on the blockchain OR a way to KYC your customers on the blockchain and tie that to traditional insurance

* A way to bond the renter on the blockchain in case you needed to charge them for incidentals such as vomit cleanup (like having a credit card on file, or a blockchain bond posted)

* A tribunal of some sort to look at the picture and see, indeed, that the renter vomited in the car and the owner wasn't making it up (like your credit card company, or some independent blockchain entity)

* A rating system so that shitty cars/owners can get banned, unless you want people renting their cars based entirely on word-of-mouth reviews/reputation

Hopefully you can look at each of these points and tell me ""yeah we already thought of that, it's part of our design paper"". If you haven't thought of any of this, then now is time to figure out what kind of system you're actually designing.",The project should be based around the economics of the project it’s much easier to explain the need for blockchain when you have financial incentives for users and investors.,You don't need blockchain for this.

A ZK-SNARK (don't bother thinking about what that stands for, from now on it's just a word) is a proof that you ran a computer program on some input and you got some output. If you run a program `P` with some input `x` and get some output `y = P(x)`, you can generate a ZK-SNARK, which you can give to someone else to convince someone else that `y` actually is the result of running `P(x)`. The proof can be verified much more quickly than running `P` directly, so it's a powerful tool for trustlessly outsourcing computation. If you want, you can also generate a ZK-SNARK where you *do not* tell the verifier `x`; then the proof would just convince them that `y` is the result of running `P` on _some_ input that you know, without revealing what it is.

Sigma protocols are _one kind of mathematical formalism_ for talking about certain kinds of proofs of computation.

Fiat-Shamir is a technique for converting interactive protocols (""I send you X, you send me challenge Y, I send you response Z, you check X, Y, Z and see if my response was valid and if it's valid you accept"") into non-interactive protocols (""I send you a proof, and you can see if it's correct or not without any further interaction with me""). Fiat-Shamir just means using the hash or merkle root of X to generate Y, so the prover can just compute Y locally instead of asking the verifier for Y, but because Y is dependent on the hash of X, changing X re-randomizes Y so there's no way for a malicious prover to create an X that ""targets"" a favorable Y that lets them cheat with more than a very very tiny probability.

An RSA accumulator is a cryptographic gadget that does something similar to what Merkle trees do, except it has mathematical properties that make proving certain kinds of things about the data that an RSA accumulator is committing to easier.

A Pedersen commitment does many of the same things as a hash (`pedersen_commit(X, r)` and `hash(X, r)` can often be used interchangeably with some carefulness), except it has an ""additively homomorphic"" property: `pedersen_commit(X1, r1) + pedersen_commit(X2, r2) = pedersen_commit(X1 + X2, r1 + r2)`.

Attribute based encryption is (this could just be my bias, IDK) honestly not really worth learning about; I've personally never encountered an application in the wild where it's necessary, it's a highly specialized tool for some specific use cases.

Homomorphic encryption is indeed powerful, but it's a quite different tool than ZK-SNARKs. In general, doing things with ZK-SNARKs requires all of the private information to be held by one party (the prover) at the point in time. Homomorphic encryption, obfuscation, MPC, and the rest are valuable because they enable computations where different inputs are held by different people and neither party learns the private information of the others. In the case of homomorphic encryption, one party retains the privacy of their data, and the other party retains the privacy of what program they ran on the data. You _could_ also use homomorphic encryption for computation outsourcing for scalability, but in practice the overhead of homomorphic encryption is too high for that to be practical at present.",,

You just ran into one.

The remaining Bitcoin enthusiasts are capable of understanding that many newer crypto projects than Bitcoin have brought major advancements in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain, and that they are legitimate projects as well.

Ethereum, in particular, is the original Smart Contract crypto platform, and basically conjured an entire new field of programming and technology out of thin air when it was introduced in 2015, and today, a very large fraction of all top cryptocurrencies by market cap are, in fact, tokens on Ethereum, to name just one example of the sea change that caused. Anybody who thinks that it's all just a scam is willfully ignorant and misguided. There are thousands of crypto projects that are 100% a scam, but Ethereum is categorically not one of them.","Damn it he got us! He's right, we're all in on the scam, including everyone here:

https://twitter.com/AdamScochran/status/1217524744909660162","You must be talking about the nonesense on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/fly6hl/btc_bch_or_eth/

Allow me...

1. The articles cited were really biased. The whole thing about quantum computing is all about how Crypto in general can be targeted in the future using the said tech. ETH under Proof Of Work or Proof Of Stake can implement Lamport Signature scheme to safe guard against this. That was all there is to it. When the tech goes mainstream Ethereum will be ready.

2. ""Ethereum tokens as first sold in its ICO might pass the Howey Test, but that doesn’t mean Ether is a security."" Independent and Impatial Source: https://www.finder.com/analysis-is-ethereum-a-security-will-it-pass-the-howey-test

3. Unlike BTC, ETH is a platform - main reason why I am here. I have no holdings on both but I am an avid follower of the tech from which I believe will be the bed rock of Web 3.0. This is important to us and future generations with all that is happening all around us. ETH being a platform naturally evolves over time. The value proposition of BTC is its following to refuse any change in to it. Can you imagine the implication of of a fixed supply in the long term? Even the Universe itself expands and contracts. The rarity attribute that BTC has is very artificial and is pretty much a ""smoke and mirrors"" thing that is used to sell it. Think about it. The last BTC is projected to be mined by 2140. Now unless you can live that long (or anyone alive today), that limit of 21 million is irrelevant. Only the issuance rate is what matters.

4. He talks scaling challenge? BTC can do a mere 4 transactions per second max. ETH used to be able to do 7 back in 2017-18 All Time Highs. The last major ETH update (Istanbul) targeted for it to go 3000tps and it fell short. Real time benchmarks indicate that it can do about 2400. This is not that bad considering that VISA can only do 1800tps. Put Starkware in to the discussion and you get 9k. Specs of real-time measurements (not approximations) stated here: https://twitter.com/starkwareltd/status/1214236179551412232
I say u/bitusher is out of his damn mind and don't know what the fuck he's talking about (yes I tagged you... please come out and play).

5. He must be talking about the whole ETC split. He wants the bad guys to win. The whole ""Code is Law"" BS is flawed. ETH evolved away from that. If code is law that makes devs the sheriffs or God... the dictators, supreme leader or what ever bullshit governance that will never work. Devs are humans and humans make mistakes. To make code be law is stupid. We have seen all that. Ask him how many forks did BTC have so far. It's not like they were improvements either. Ridiculous. NEXT!

6. Final algo?  LOL. Like everything else ETH is evolving. Over the bear market of 2018 to the present day we have non-stop progress on new tech and innovation in this place that guys like him will not know about because they simply refuse to evolve.

About his other post...
Even BTC's Peter Todd wanted to raise that hard cap because it is stupid.

Their proposed scaling solution Lightning (LN) is yet to be implemented to their mainnet because it is yet to be shown that it is working. So will 4tps dumpster fire coin be enough to serve the globe? That's right. Didn't think so."

We think stablecoins might not be great for payments, because of their exposure to their collateral's volatility, or being backed by opaque companies.

Instead, for a local economy, using a dedicated local currency proves to be more resilient. Especially in developing countries, where many people technically are poor, but still have lots of products to sell, a local currency fills a demand for liquidity to trade goods and services.

Research on charitable donations shows this problem especially well. Cash donations in national currency simply leave the local economy, as soon as a foreign company identifies cheap labor and money. Whereas a local currency is to no use to a foreign company, since its only redeemable for local products. And experience shows that local people accept the new currency quickly - merchants gradually accept the new currency as payment and individuals use it to buy products.

We are now testing this theory with our partner Grassroots Economics, by deploying a universal basic income (UBI) to 10,000 Kenyans in rural villages and slums.

[The blog post](https://medium.com/multiply-impact/running-a-10-000-person-economy-in-kenya-on-dai-backed-credit-tokens-53c13d6d5a4) describes how the local currency is set up and what kind of insights we can gain from 10k people using blockchain donations for everyday payments.

At [**multiply.charity**](https://multiply.charity/) we accept donations only on Rinkeby testnet yet.

I believe there was some code added somewhere to stop them from working. Because I tried running them a month ago and get a ton of errors upon opening the apps.  
  
I criticized it tons when it was happening to no avail. It's stupid to not have an official wallet that a user can download the whole blockchain and run a full node with. Core devs argued it was for the sake of decentralization. That they want others to be in charge of creating wallets. Even though those others have focused on only creating light wallets.  
  
Not having an official full node wallet opens of the possibility of people seeking to run a full node running malicious, closed source, and unpopular wallets. And gives less people access to full blockchain data.  
  
geth is the next best option, still supported and updated. But that's command line. So it's more difficult for the average person to learn and use.","If you're looking to run a stand-alone wallet, then once you have the latest geth 1.9 sync'd, you can install and use the app MyCrypto to connect to your local geth."

I’m happy to hear any input or criticism.

I think ideas like this are good for the ecosystem. Even if I would not choose to utilize one of these options, the fact that the option is available and possible is important. 

In my eyes:

More nodes (users) = more stable network. 

More contracts of differing length and requirements = more stable network.

Differing incentive structures and ensured staking, sounds good to me.

I am not expert, correct me as needed.

Edit: Perhaps I should switch ‘stable’ with ‘secure’, not sure why I conflated the two in my head. I was not referencing price and volatility at all, simply stability of the network, which is in a way an umbrella term with security underneath it.",Love this idea.,"That’s what we did with Pareto Network back in 2017, an open source formula that just watches how long you haven’t moved Pareto and gives you more benefits on the platform people run

[Status Nimbus](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus/blob/master/doc/Nimbus%20-%20An%20Ethereum%202.0%20Sharding%20Client_xt.md) is developing a client that runs on cell phone hardware. They have a [test client available](https://our.status.im/the-nimbus-mvp-testnet-is-here/), but I don't know what their most recent status is.

[Prysmatic Labs](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) (Go implementation) and [Sigma Prime (Lighthouse)](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse) (Rust implementation) are developing general use clients that should run on common desktop hardware and even limited hardware like NUC's and Raspberry Pi 4. These clients are fully featured and are maturing very quickly and approaching a public multi-client testnet within the next few **days**.

[Rocket Pool](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/development-update-10th-april-72db7824c8e0) is a third party service designed to coordinate other tools to enable trustless pooled staking. They just released a development update today saying they've made progress on their GUI and have implemented the Lighthouse client into their stack. Rocket Pool is definitely winning the ease-of-use race with their GUI, but as a third party service they are relying on the stack provided by many other parties. So many moving parts does increase the risk a bit, but it appears to be a well managed and developed product.

The liquidity problem should be solved in 2 ways: (1) a CEX/DEX arbitrage bot for liquidity providers and (2) the ""liquidity multiplier"" that is you can use the same funds to setup multiple maker orders (the first filled deletes the others, nice to catch dips)",,

- the main hypothesis is that staking locking will cause 30% of eth to be locked forever, causing supply shock
- however, we know from santiment analysis and others that the amount of active eth addresses is at a 2 year low. In short, I believe that the non-circulating supply is already higher than 30%. These are ""hodlers"" that don't want to risk playing in DeFi, and just hold eth long term already
- So there is a good chance that the 30% locked eth will come not from the circulating supply, but instead from these hodlers, effectively leaving the supply at an equilibrium 
- The post talked about how ""overreaching"" may happen due to the 32eth minimum increment for staking. I think this is just false, because decentralized staking pools are already becoming available via rocket pool. Great tech! Means anyone of any amount can stake. I still think overreaching will be a factor, but a small one
- eth2 phase0 is a great step forward, but let's remember that it will be almost useless. You can't run dapps, or even move funds. Any money you lock in it will be stuck for an indefinite amount of time, until phase1. This is what we call a very high risk speculative term deposit... Not a great mix of words. The post makes it seem like eth2 is ""in a couple months"" and will enable all this great new tech
- In my professional opinion as a developer, I think even phase0 may still be 6 months away. We have a very promising new testnet, but only one implementation up to date (Prysmatic). There will need to be many more rounds of debugging, stress testing, cross client testing, public bounty hunting, and simple waiting - until the eth leads feel confident enough to launch mainnet. How long until phase1 after that is simply unclear

In the meanwhile, I want to remind us that eth1 is here to stay for quite a long time. Perhaps years still. And that's great! It already kinda does everything we need. Check it out:

- we have instant onboarding with tech like Portis, and magic.link. No need to install anything, just username/email and go
- ux around gas has been solved via meta-transactions. It's already possible to pay for gas in any token, including WBTC or USDC
- scalability is partially solved with rollups and plasma
- the cost of nodes and sync has a solution with stateless sync designs. Very excited for those to get implemented because it means even phones can run nodes potentially...

So that's my reality check. Don't want for eth2 to save the day, it's already saved. When eth2 truly materializes and how it will affect the market is unknown","You mentioned the FOMO factor possibly being greater next time round as there was a lack of retail accounts (KYC bottlenecks, etc.) in the previous bull run. I think those bottlenecks led to a scarcity effect which increased demand further, so with more retail accounts in the system now, this might be a lesser factor next time.

This already doesn't work, as right now one sETH goes for 0.977072 ETH on uniswap.

Additionally we now have a few hundred million USD on the ETH blockchain that could easily be traded for ETH or Ethereum-based assets. I think there is some chance that they are prepping for the US dollar to lose value or else maybe the next bull market.

What are the risks? That ETH will be used only for trading USD? If that’s what the market wants and ETH can facilitate it then good for ETH.

That tether will finally implode and lose its value? In that case the whole crypto ecosystem will take a hit, but it shouldn’t change Ethereum’s position as the technical leader.

# TL;DR

* *Coinbase is launching a new price oracle for DeFi with signed price feeds from Coinbase Pro.*
* *Compound governance is live: Community governance has now replaced the administrator of the Compound protocol. From this point forward, all changes (from supported assets, to system parameters) will originate from COMP token-holders.*
* *dYdX unveils perpetual contract markets with Bitcoin swaps first: the swap, which will give traders up to 10x leverage on the BTC-USDC market, has started in a private Alpha before eventually being opened up to non-U.S. locales. Also, dYdX crosses 1billion USD in originated loans.*
* *Zerion unveils DeFi SDK, an open-source system of smart contracts that makes integrating protocols easier.*
* *Dharma introduced Social Payments — a Twitter-native financial ecosystem. You can send USD to any Twitter handle, regardless of where that person lives — even if they don’t have a Dharma account.*
* *PoolTogether Introduces Pods, which allows PoolTogether players to link their tickets together. If any ticket in the pod wins, the prize is split proportionally.*
* *Gnosis officially launched its protocol which is the result of two years of research and development. Moreover, Gnosis is funding and supporting the public non-profit initiative Corona Information Markets, a decentralized prediction markets platform, with the aim of uncovering key information about the novel coronavirus. They’ve provided $50k in subsidy to create 50 information markets covering different aspects of the pandemic.*
* *Maker stability fees changed, now 6% for USDC, 0% for ETH/BAT, (DSR obviously still 0). ‘Black Thursday’ losses spur $28 million class-action lawsuit against Maker Foundation.*
* *0x announced Matcha, a new trading platform that aggregates all DEX liquidity to give users the best price. Launching Q2 2020.*
* *Aave is back with another development update including Token burn PageFire, new menu and HomepageGlowing star, user-friendly liquidations PageDroplet and Risk framework.*
* *Uniswap V2 Bug Bounty Program announced.*
* *imBTC Uniswap Pool Drained for \~$300k in ETH.*
* *Synthetix integrates the new Curve pool.*
* *1inch integrates Curve’s sUSD pool with Synthetix staking.*
* *UMA announced initial Uniswap listing: the permissionless derivatives protocol is listing its native token on Uniswap on Wednesday, April 29th, at a valuation of \~$26M.*
* *Coinbase Wallet has integrated with Frontier’s Mobile interface, enabling users to access Native DeFi dApps on mobile without having to import seed phrases or private keys.*
* *Automation v2 on DeFi Saver introduced. The latest automation system can now react to the next price in the MakerDAO protocol and utilizes flash loans for better optimized ratio and leverage adjustments.*
* *SheFi, a DeFi educational program that is also a vehicle to donate funds to nonprofits that educate women in STEM programs, announced.*
* *dForce attacker returns all $25M back to project*
* *A writeup of PieDAO’s managed Balancer pools.*
* *The Rise of MakerDAO: A Personal Journey on Unchained: Mariano Conti head of smart contracts at MakerDAO, reads from his essay about his personal experience with cryptocurrency, particularly as an Argentine whose family has experienced periods of hyperinflation, and as a freelancer accepting payment from foreign countries.*
* *Dissolving the Foundation and the Future of MakerDAO with Rune Christensen on POV Crypto.*

Check out our latest podcast!,"Please don't dismiss me as an ASIC shill. Farm I manage is composed of many GPUs. I just want to put some objective points in the table. EDIT: To be clear, I WAS pro ProgPOW when it was initially proposed.

**ProgPOW:**

1. Please name 1 node with big hash that's got all ASIC behind it. I really want to see proof of this. From [here](https://etherscan.io/stat/miner?blocktype=blocks) we can approximate that 77% of the hash comes from the top 6 pools. Which one is it? Or [here](https://etherscan.io/chart/hashrate) dice it and let me know the big chunk that belongs to ASICs. Pretty sure it's tiny.

2. Decentralization works best with free and open approach. Inclining towards a set of device centralizes it towards the said devices.

3. In the early days, people also said the mantra that ""code is law"". Things change. There are times where in order for us to do the right thing (e.g.: to take action on that DAO hack) we need be a little less rigid on these things. Sure they sang songs about ASIC resistance in the beginning too. It did not say ASIC proof now, did it?

4. Nothing stops anyone from creating a ProgPOW ASIC. Sure the advantage will be less but it would still be more efficient. I believe the audits covered this.

5. It is only because of the discussions over the last few months that it was considered to be thrown into a testnet which is the next logical step and not scheduling without clear consensus. 

Considering how much push went behind it here in Reddit by it's proponents (let alone everywhere else) makes me very suspicious about it all. This is specially given that the threat that it is meant to mitigate or get rid off is not even backed by solid numbers. I mean do we really know that ASICs are running rampant and is centralizing the network? No. There are ASICs but the way I see it, older GPUs and ASICs a-like are about to stop mining sometime near the end of the year. We don't know how the total net hash is going to look like. Might be best served to get a better idea before we change anything. Billy said it himself, ""things look okay at the moment"". Not saying we should not have plans for the ""just in case"" either but before an emergency plan gets put in place, it should get rigorously tested first.

**Governance:**

1. ETH needs no dictator(s). If there's going to be any, we should know that it should be the wider community.

Ultimately, there should be measures to discourage new batch of big money getting into mining altogether (a more gradual rewards reduction perhaps?). Big money also should be buying ETH in preparation to staking anyway. This should mitigate or even completely avoid  the scenario of a hard fork when it's time to hop on full POS. This will be a balancing act because we need to make sure that the current miners are still gets enough incentive to support the network during the transition. We can't really say that if you oust the ASICs out of the network now that the hard fork will not happen with the GPU miners. This is especially if you give them a GPU specific/biased algo which gives them more reasons to keep going on the POW chain later on resulting to the same scenario of a hard fork.",,

Without a fee, you could spam the blockchain.  That's why they are required. This is very basic blockchain economics.  EIP 1559 will burn fees which is even better.","My gosh, imagine lacking so much comprehension skills that you passed up on a life-changing investment despite having been there early.","* It’s not “fees go to the founders”, it’s “payment for gas goes to the miner that mines the block” (under PoW, where mining is permissionless) / “gas goes to the validator who minted the block” (under PoS, where validating is somewhat permissioned since staked ETH has to be acquired)

* why not a free Turing machine? To create a cost for spamming / DDoS - without it, it would be very cheap to render the network unusable. Making an unpermissioned, safe and secure blockchain without transaction fees is a theoretically unsolved problem."

A sharded POS blockchain that vitalik said could challenge eth? They have launched but we seem to be 3-5 years away.,"I'm all for competition, but comparing this to Ethereum in any way is misleading.

They launched a four node PoA network, that may become PoS in the future. No mention of multiple clients, any form of validation, audits or formal verification. Where is the detailed explanation of the protocol? What are the trade-offs?

For example, they write that smart-contract owners get a percentage of the gas fee. Sounds good, until one realizes this encourages to write inefficient contracts.","Near is also drawing on a Silicon Valley culture of “ship it, and ship it fast!”

You should hire the Parity team.

I couldn't get to an immediate white paper on the protocol, so I really don't care.","A lot can be learned from their process, technology, economics, and especially dev communications.

I can't comment about the protocol design, but I know that the founders are very experienced/skilled in database design and development.

This is a different kind of project -- particularly their emphasis on shipping earlier in the process vs. Eth2's emphasis on researching more thoroughly -- not exactly comparable to in the sense of what is successful. These are two different approaches to creating networks, with different cost/benefit/risks.

Also, ""launched"" has some nuance once you check out the details of what is launching at this point: https://near.org/blog/near-mainnet-genesis/. 

IMO it is a smart strategy to release a mainnet that dapp devs can use today, while the nodes are POA and run by the NEAR foundation w/ an SLA, etc. It allows for an ecosystem to develop while the final rollout work is happening (not a strategy that Eth2 devs and teams would be able to use)."

The mystery would be no one would know if they would receive the rare prize. A non-monetary prize. People could trade unopened cookies because they would still have a chance for a rare prize. 

Or

If you were into gaming you could make something with nominal fee for opening. Some opened cookies would be given a voucher to redeem these fees collected. Others would simply receive the fortune written by the AI bot.

1 token could redeem all fees accrued and has the option to delay redemption. No one would know it has been found unless they redeem. 

10 tokens could redeem all the fees remaining since the last time a redemption occurred. Redeemed when opened. 

100 tokens could redeem 10% of the remaining fees collected. Redeemed when opened. 

1000 tokens could redeem 1% of the remaining fees collected. Redeemed when opened. 

The remaining 8,889 tokens get a fortune and loose the opening fee. 


I like the idea that you can own an unopened cookie. Trade them. But if you take the chance to open, you could get the one. 

The one would be a separate game; to know how long to wait. Because the 10 or the 100 could be opened at any time and take away from the prize pool. 

You could even check in to the progress on that cookie set because if no one had yet claimed the 1 that gained all fees then you will feel you have a chance. But you won’t want to open it and have wasted your money. The game has a lot of complexity.

Maybe the opening fee could be 0.01 ETH. That would make each round of 10,000 cookies have MAX 100 Eth to be gained.",I love this idea! How can I participate?

All that matters for the value of ETH is: How much fee revenue is there, and how much money has already been created by the time mining stops. The fee revenue going forward is split among holders of the money going backwards, and that's the value of ETH.

It doesn't matter how much issuance there is in proof-of-stake, because it's all going to ETH holders, so it's more like a stock split (existing holders still hold the same proportion of the company) than a stock issuance (new holders get stocks, and this money is used to pay for operations)."

While we appreciate the enthusiasm and excitement u/MyFacelessVoid, as I mentioned directly on Telegram when you sent us this link, posts like this many times do more damage than good.

I wanted to a few things clear to anyone who may stumble across this post.

&#x200B;

1. XIO was inspired to create an alternative model to the risky and scam ridden ICO model. For this reason and to show how much we believe in this concept/model ([Crowdstaking](https://xio.network/xio-crowdstaking-staking-how-does-it-work/)), we gave away 100% of the circulating supply of tokens away for free.

We don't plan to raise capital and much prefer readers of this become an XIO Citizen than purchase the tokens.

&#x200B;

2) We also have 50M+ additional tokens set to be given away over the next many years through various programs and initiatives that help push the project forward:

[XIO Social Initiative (XSI)](https://xio.network/social/): The XSI is a system to reward Citizens of the Network for their quick, consistent, and quality engagement across all XIO social platforms.

[XIO Liquidity Program (XLP)](https://medium.com/bombx/xio-commits-25m-tokens-to-liquidity-program-xlp-rewards-calculator-instructions-634a26df3430):  The XLP is an initiative to jump-start liquidity into the XIO Network and reward the Citizens who help make it possible.

3) To ensure we attract the right type of users on our Dapp (XIO Citizens), we have intentionally stayed on Uniswap, building and funding our own liquidity pool. We are not looking for centralized exchanges as Uniswap gives our project everything it needs and more at this time.

&#x200B;

We have been working on the project over the last 6+ months, building a somewhat small but super [tight knit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/xio_network).

It would be extremely disappointing that, many months of work on this project trying to build the community from the ground up in the right way, a speculative post on r/ethereum could paint us in a negative light.

If anyone on this subreddit has any questions about the project, what we are building, please let me know here. Would be happy to answer.

If anyone is looking to become a private beta tester of the staking Dapp, we have been testing for about 5 weeks now and adding new people every day. Reply to this with a comment and I will send you instructions.

**EDIT:** (Last note that should be moved up in importance: XIO is not a true #Defi project yet. The code for the Dapp is extremely centralized as we do beta testing. We have the ability to upgrade the contract where needed. The future goal is that everything from interest rates to stake durations are 100% governed by the XIO Citizens. We aren't there but excited to build towards that vision over time.)","This post was removed for violated the 2nd rule on the sidebar.  Sorry - feel free to re-post without the market talk.

It's entirely a wallet-side thing.,"Its true checksums are not implemented at the protocol level, but they ought to have been implemented at the application level. That's what [EIP-55](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55) is all about. As you can see, most of the wallets (and web3 libraries) already reject invalid checksum addresses, though its a shame that many exchanges don't.

>This is a \~50x improvement over ICAP, but not as good as a 4-byte check code.

There are plenty of attack vectors for this DAO that realistically this will never work. Plenty more ways a user can make mistakes with their destination address: using the ERC20 contract address, typing the address by hand, copy-paste errors, and more. We can't keep making DAOs. There are also too many malicious actors in this space. Hence, I, for one, don't believe that a DAO is the way to go.

But, tons of people with no tech support are coming into Ethereum these days. It's easy to blame the users when they lose their hard-earned money over such mistakes, but we are supposed to be better than the banks. So if we want to go for mass adoption, we ought to be doing something to mitigate the risk."

The year is 2140 and the last BTC halving has just happened.  The block reward is now 0 and the final miner has converted their BTC to WBTC on the ETH blockchain.

Without a block reward, Bitcoin miners only have transaction fees to rely on. But since there are no more transactions, there are no more fees, and no incentives for miners to keep validating blocks. The Bitcoin blockchain is now a dying wasteland.  The last bastion of survival for its tokens are now on another Planet -- Ethereum.

True to the sacred accords of EIP1559, transaction fees are still paid in ETH.  Each time a WBTC transfer happens, a small portion of it is converted to ETH to pay for the transaction fee.  The relentless march of slow and steady WTBC<> ETH conversion continues....

The year is now 2240, and there is only a single satoshi of WBTC left.  It has become a curiosity, to be sold in an auction held outside the steps at the Temple of Vitalik.  Its buyer then ceremonially burns it - sending it to the genesis address, from which all tokens were spawned.

Checkmate Maximalists.","Poor lightning network.  Its cheaper and faster to use Bitcoin on Ethereum then Bitcoin on Bitcoin.

2. The way ETH 2.0 is being implemented is because of these concerns. First, staking is being run without any critical data. It's just to make sure that the validation and staking thing works in the real world with little to no risk. It can be rolled back without any risk to things running on 1.0.  Then, once it is proven secure, the other stuff will be moved to 2.0 in two more phases.","Ethereum 2.0 phase 0 will have it's own token in a separate blockchain running the beacon chain so technically it is a different token.  However this ETH 2.0 token won't be liquid and you won't be able to trade, exchange, use defi with, etc. You will only be able to stake it and get rewards.

So somewhere in the future when ETH 2.0 phase 1.5 or phase 2 have gone live this new ETH 2.0 token and ETH 1.0 will finally merge into one again.

Is it possible that by trying to combine both products something bad happens? sure. That's why ETH 2.0 researchers are trying to figure out the best way for this merger to happen painlessly for users and existing applications. Also there will be testnets that hopefully will be able to catch all bugs before launch similar to what happened with the latest multiclient testnet hiccups. Devs and users hope and work so that these bugs are caught before and not during mainnet.",

But I am confused, by the below.

""Before the Ethereum 2.0 network can be activated, at least 524,288 ETH is required to be collectively staked. Each individual validator account requires a staking deposit of exactly 32 ETH. Individuals can stake multiple times if they want to run more than one validator account and the Launchpad supports the addition of multiple validators during the sign-up process.

Validators earn rewards (paid in ETH) for their efforts. Depending on the total amount of staked ETH securing the network, rewards could be anywhere in the range of 2–18% per year.""

So this means that if I own more than 32ETH and less than 64ETH, the maximum I can stake is 32ETH? Can anyone confirm this? The calculators never mentioned that.

This would mean low returns, locking my ETH for just 2% doesn't sound good. I would still do it to support what Ethereum represents, but that's not good for a mass adoption.",When is pos suppose to start?

6/7/2020,gymeld,2,/r/ethereum/comments/gymeld/how_is_a_zkrollup_constructed/,1,ethereum,How is a zkRollup constructed?,"The basis is ZK-based technologies (ZKSNARK, ZKSTARK as examples).  Zero knowledge is an important part, but they also have other properties which can be just as important (\*\*depending on what your solution requires).  **One of these is creating an asymmetry between the prover and verifier resources needed**.

Example:

Program:  Take public input integer A, private inputs integers B and C, and execute the program successfully showing B\*C = A and that neither B nor C are 1.  

Now a **prover** of such a program execution can create a proof P and send it to a **verifier**.  The verifier takes the proof and is **convinced** that Prover actually ran the program correctly (honestly) for a given public input (A)  (i.e. prover knows B and C such that B\*C = A and neither factors are 1).  But the private values are never known to the verifier.

**An important aspect is that large computations can be verified by the verifier in much less time/processing power than the original computation**.  One consequence is that the prover has to do more than the usual work to create the proof.  This fits with blockchains well though since you have ONE prover (e.g. person who creates a transaction) who does **a little more work** but EVERYONE else (**miners or stakers**) can verify with far less resources than running the original computation.  One reason blockchains have scaling issues is that everyone has to check the state changes by re-doing the original transaction.  It is great if only one person did little bit more computation while everyone else could do way less.

Now for ZK-rollup, there is an on-chain contract on Ethereum that acts as the Verifier.

There is an off-chain entity known as an Operator that receives transactions (off chain) from users, creates a proof of a valid state transition and publishes it on-chain to the Verifier contract.  

Part of this is designing the ""program"" so that it checks that the states A (prior state) and B (resulting state) are a valid transition.  In an exchange that could mean that money isn't created (someone lost X coin, someone else gained X coin) and the transaction was signed by the Users (among a list of other 'checks').  The operator can batch thousands of these valid state changes (i.e. execution of orders on an exchange for example) and then create a proof using whatever computational resources needed and then publish it.

The Ethereum miners essentially execute the verifier (because it is an Ethereum contract that takes the proof as input).  The prover (Operator) and verifier contract are **specific** to a given computation (a program with known public inputs and unknown private inputs).

> Firstly, who selects the transactions, rolls them up and publishes this rollup? For instance, if I try to double spend using transfers on Loopring, someone has to publish a rollup where they only select one of my transactions. Is this done by an Ethereum miner or is it someone at Loopring? 

A valid proof of a specified program ensures that the 'rules' are obeyed.  Each state of the off-chain program will execute checks to make sure state transitions are valid.  The operator simply can't create a valid proof that allows you to double spend.  This kind of system requires careful program (ZK circuit) design.

> Also, how does it work if I try to double spend with one transaction being on Loopring Pay and the other transaction being to withdraw my funds from Loopring's DEX? The first transaction is advertised as ""instantly confirmed"" but this cannot be true since I'm trying to do a double spend here and there has to be a process to select one of my two spends. 

One way to go about this is for the operator to ""Serve"" the withdrawal requests.  So there is a proof published by the Operator which includes some kind of ""free up this much coin for user X"" and then internally, deducts it from your trade-able balance.  **There is a check point that requires the Operator.**

This can lead to some issues.  What if the operator just ignores your request?  What if a part of your request requires you to prove that your balance (you are withdrawing) is your actual balance and not something made up?  But the operator hides the full state?  One solution is just publishing the actual trades onto Ethereum as well.  BUT these are not really analyzed by the miners --- this is simply using Ethereum as a trustworthy and reliable store of data.  (on-chain data solution to the data availability problem).  Then you can design the on-chain contract to lock-up if your request isn't serviced in a timely manner (Operator releases your funds or proves you are lying).  This is just a small portion of the considerations needed.",,

6/8/2020,gywkuc,5,/r/ethereum/comments/gywkuc/geth_v1915_berlin_eips_merged_and_exposed_for/,134,ethereum,Geth v1.9.15: Berlin EIPs merged and exposed for YOLOv1 testnet,"Geth v1.9.15 is a maintenance release containing bug fixes as well as implementations of all EIPs currently scheduled for the upcoming Berlin fork. A *temporary* test network for these EIPs has also been launched at https://yolonet.xyz/ and can be joined via Geth with `--yolov1` flag.

The minimum Go version required to build `go-ethereum` is now Go 1.13.

The `eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas` and `eth_sendTransaction` RPC methods now return the revert reason as a JSON-RPC error when the contract executes REVERT. The returned error includes the decoded reason string in the error message, and also makes the raw REVERT data available in the error's `""data""` field:

```
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""id"": 1,
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": 3,
    ""message"": ""execution reverted: some error"",
    ""data"": ""0x08c379a000000000000000000...""
  }
}
```

Other improvements and fixes in this release:

- The LES 'server pool' was rewritten and can now use DNS discovery to find light servers ([#20758](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20758)).
- Argument checking for natively-implemented console functions is improved ([#21081](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21081), [#21160](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21160)).
- Geth no longer hangs during shutdown while waiting for synced blocks to import ([#21114](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21114)).
- The RPC client now sends WebSocket ping frames when connection is idle ([#21142](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21142)).
- Uses of the `gosigar` library have been replaced by `gopsutil`. This restores building Geth on `darwin` without cgo and makes automatic database cache size selection work on OpenBSD ([#21041](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21041)).
- Prometheus metrics exporting no longer sends duplicate type definitions ([#21068](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21068)).
- Password input prompts in Clef now work when stdin is not a TTY ([#20960](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20960)).
- Internal sync error reporting has been made more detailed ([#21067](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21067)).
- EVM JUMPDEST checks are a bit faster in certain cases ([#21123](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21123)).
- Fix the `puppeth` faucet's tweet retrieval endpoint ([#21172](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21172)).

The following core EIPs are implemented in this release:

- EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations ([#21018](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21018)).
- EIP-2315: JUMPSUB for the EVM ([#20619](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/20619)).

Please note that the EIP implementations are not yet scheduled to activate and will receive further testing and development before the fork.

For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.9.15 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/101?closed=1).

It remains decentralised and doesn't require you to deposit ETH into a seperate L2 compatible wallet before using it. You can use it directly from your current wallet.

I've been on the fence about L2 solutions for years now because lightning network completely ruined the idea for me. I hated the complexity and felt that even with years of improvement the fact you have to load a LN wallet with funds before being able to use the protocol wasnt great. 

Zkrollups are genuinely amazing and I now understand why vitalik is so enthusiastic about them.",Twitter discussion: [https://twitter.com/the\_matter\_labs/status/1271397788174159872](https://twitter.com/the_matter_labs/status/1271397788174159872),">zkSync uses PLONK, a newer proof system with a universal trusted setup

gaslimit: is the maximum units of gas you’re willing to spend in a transaction.

gasprice: this is the cost per unit of gas in Ether.

&#x200B;

Imagine a car - it takes and uses gas at a pretty well defined rate.  Say 30miles per gallon.  It doesn’t matter whether you pay $1 or $100 per gallon, the car will only ever travel 30 miles on each gallon.

&#x200B;

Contracts work the same way.  The contract has a fixed number of instructions (to make it easy let’s bar conditional branching) where each instruction has a fixed gas cost.  When you set a gasPrice, you are adjustping the price you pay per unit of gas.  A gas limit is a way to limit the work that can be done - think of it like putting a certain amount of gas into the tank of a vehicle.  You’re limiting the distance that car can travel on a given journey.

&#x200B;

Before a miner runs your transaction, the entire gasLimit \* gasPrice will be deducted from your account.  This is to ensure that you don’t run out of funds to pay the miner during the course of the transaction.  After your transaction, the difference between (gasPrice\*gasLimit) and the total gasUsed will be refunded.

&#x200B;

Do not set arbitrary gasLimits.  Run estimateGas on your transaction. Maybe pad it 5-10% to account for state changes in the interim.

&#x200B;

As you can see, arbitrarily raising the gasPrice and gasLimit has put you in the situation where your transaction is incredibly expensive, especially if it fails.

&#x200B;

ps: this community is often exceptionally helpful.  Doing your own research is always a good idea and I would encourage you to continue doing as much research on your own as possible. With that said, unless time is of the essence, feel free to ask me or others some of the specifics if you’re still unsure.",">the problem was not the Gwei price (4 Gwei was plenty)

When you're buying something generally you don't want to increase the price. you buy gas every time you send a transaction, but no one tells people that. i probably did a few hundred hours of reading before i sent a transaction. and honestly in four years I've never sent a transaction to a contract. because the cost-benefit isn't there right now, at least for me

>extra data may cause you to need a higher gas limit.

As for people encouraging people to mess with gas limits, that's terrible. Gas limit is for ""holy shit i'm about to call some shady contract code that i don't understand or trust, maybe i should have a little insurance."" I guess it could help if you accidentally mess up one of the other parameters very badly",

If the exchange is down, the user can withdraw directly from the smart contract. However, I'm not aware of an easy fronted for doing this. It will be nice of Loopring to provide this in open-source, along with a web interface to view the balance of every address (it's public information).","Hi celticwarrior. That's the key question :). As many alluded to below, it never 'had' your funds. An open source deposit smart contract has them, and maps them to the zkRollup environment - the off-chain Merkle tree. A rollup design ensures that the system publishes enough data from the Merkle tree to Ethereum, so as any user can 'recreate' the Merkle tree by themselves just from reading Ethereum, and assert that a balance is theirs and only theirs, and can withdraw it by interacting with the smart contract. If the exchange is down, anyone can do this by interacting with the smart contract directly, or anyone else can build a UI to help non-technical people just 'click a button' for it.

Most people think we're super weird so I'm doing my best to explain it from how other people view the space. 

There's a time and a place to name drop Ethereum but sometimes you got to go with Bitcoin for accessibility. 

I want to ask for your support for my Gitcoin grant. I'm trying to get into Ethereum education full time. Starting with my newsletter and also a consultancy business. I'm doing this based on my long held premise that the technology is a 10, and awareness is at a 0. We can RT each other on Twitter all day long about the inevitable mooning but the reality is we're all bobbing along to the whims of whale games while we wait for the rest of the world to wake up to what's going on. I'm doing by best to bring this stuff front and center to every investment and financial professional I can reach out to. My newsletter already has a handful of high profile investors I personally know that would otherwise know nothing about crypto. 

[If you wish to support my grant, you can do so here.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/156/zero-knowledge-education) Every Dai means a lot because of the matching and today is the first day so it would be amazing if I got off to a good start. I'm not going to pretend that a few thousand Dai wouldn't help me a lot. The newsletter at least is truly a public good as it's non-rivalrous and non-excludable. 

This community is in a rare position to play kingmaker for any of these grants as this is home to 90%+ of all people who know how to make a tx on Gitcoin. I can't promise anything but know that I'm doing my best to not just sit here and wait for adoption to come to us. It's a rare circumstance where my incentives are perfectly aligned with the Ethereum community so helping me helps you.

Dragonchain has demonstrated **twice Reddit’s entire total daily volume (votes, comments, and posts** [**per Reddit 2019 Year in Review**](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/)**)** in a [24-hour demo](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4) on an operational network.  Every single transaction on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with combined proof on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. At the time, in January 2020, the entire cost of the demo was approximately $25K on a single system (transaction fees locked at $0.0001/txn). With current fees (lowest fee $0.0000025/txn), this would cost as little as $625.

If you’d like to read the full proposal with formatting go to the [Dragonchain blog](https://dragonchain.com/blog/reddit-ethereum-blockchain-scalability).

## Hello Reddit and Ethereum community!

I’m Joe Roets, Founder & CEO of Dragonchain. When the team and I first heard about The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off we were intrigued. We believe we have the solutions Reddit seeks for its community points system and we have them at scale.

For your consideration, we have submitted our proposal below. The team at Dragonchain and I welcome and look forward to your technical questions, philosophical feedback, and fair criticism, to build a scaling solution for Reddit that will empower its users. Because our architecture is unlike other blockchain platforms out there today, we expect to receive many questions while people try to grasp our project. I will personally answer all questions across two locations. First, I will be live on a special episode of Super Happy Dragon Lucky, Tuesday, July 28th at **6PM EST** where I will answer questions. I will then answer all questions here in this thread on Reddit.

We have seen good discussions so far in the competition. We hope that Reddit’s scaling solution will emerge from The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off and that Reddit will have great success with the implementation.

## Executive summary

Dragonchain is a robust open source hybrid blockchain platform that has proven to withstand the passing of time since our inception in 2014. We have continued to evolve to harness the scalability of private nodes, yet take full advantage of the security of public decentralized networks, like Ethereum. We have a live, operational, and fully functional Interchain network integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and \~700 independent Dragonchain nodes. Every transaction is secured to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum Classic. Transactions are immediately usable on chain, and the first decentralization is seen within 20 seconds on Dragon Net. Security increases further to public networks ETH, BTC, and ETC within 10 minutes to 2 hours.

Smart contracts can be written in any executable language, offering full freedom to existing developers. We invite any developer to watch the demo, play with our SDK’s, review open source code, and to help us move forward. Dragonchain specializes in scalable loyalty & rewards solutions and has built a decentralized social network on chain, with very affordable transaction costs. This experience can be combined with the insights Reddit and the Ethereum community have gained in the past couple of months to roll out the solution at a rapid pace.

## Response and PoC

In *The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off* post, Reddit has asked for a series of demonstrations, requirements, and other considerations. In this section, we will attempt to answer all of these requests.

## Live Demo

>A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions

On Jan 7, 2020, Dragonchain hosted a 24-hour live demonstration during which a quarter of a billion (250 million+) transactions executed fully on an operational network. **Every single transaction** on Dragonchain is decentralized immediately through 5 levels of Dragon Net, and then secured with **combined proof** on **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **Ethereum Classic**, and **Binance Chain**, via Interchain. This means that every single transaction is secured by, and traceable to these networks. An attack on this system would require a simultaneous attack on all of the Interchained networks.

**24 hours in 4 minutes:** [**https://youtu.be/pSfBid1\_US4**](https://youtu.be/pSfBid1_US4)

The demonstration was of a single business system, and any user is able to scale this further, by running multiple systems simultaneously. Our goals for the event were to demonstrate a consistent capacity greater than that of Visa over an extended time period.

Tooling to reproduce our demo is available here:

## Scaling

>How it works & scales

## Architectural Scaling

Dragonchain’s architecture attacks the scalability issue from multiple angles. Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform, wherein every transaction is protected on a business node to the requirements of that business or purpose. A business node may be held completely private or may be exposed or replicated to any level of exposure desired.

Every node has its own blockchain and is independently scalable. Dragonchain established *Context Based Verification* as its consensus model. Every transaction is immediately usable on a trust basis, and in time is provable to an increasing level of decentralized consensus. A transaction will have a level of decentralization to independently owned and deployed Dragonchain nodes (\~700 nodes) within seconds, and full decentralization to BTC and ETH within minutes or hours. Level 5 nodes (Interchain nodes) function to secure all transactions to public or otherwise external chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These nodes scale the system by aggregating multiple blocks into a single Interchain transaction on a cadence. This timing is configurable based upon average fees for each respective chain.

For detailed information about Dragonchain’s architecture, and *Context Based Verification*, please refer to the [Dragonchain Architecture Document](https://dragonchain.com/Dragonchain-Architecture.pdf).","> Security. Users have full ownership & control of their points.

This is the most stringent requirement in this document. The consequence of having this level of security for user assets is that it must auditable by all parties, and therefore must be made available to all parties. At this time, the only known solution to the data availability problem [[1]] are blockchains themselves. A probabilistic solution has been proposed [[2]] and is currently being implemented in Ethereum 2 Phase 1. Any scaling solution that does not post all input data on-chain is insecure with respect to this requirement.

Only one category of scaling solution possesses this kind of security: rollups. They come in two flavors, optimistic [[3]] and zero-knowledge [[4]]. Because avoiding ""moon math"" is preferred and ZK-rollups are generally very expensive to compute, let's focus on optimistic rollups (ORU). The ORU derives its name from the fact that its values should be treated optimistically. To update an ORU, a relayer will submit on-chain all the transactions they wish to include in the ORU's next block + the resulting state root of the next block. It's possible that the relayer submitted an incorrect root, so users must treat this root optimistically until either they i) verify for themselves that the txs do evaluate to the new root or ii) reach a level of confidence (k-deep some might say [[5]]) in the current progress of the chain. Because all data is posted on-chain, all parties can verify all transactions from the beginning of the ORU. Assuming a robust leader-election algorithm, the ORU will inherit the same safety and liveness properties of the base chain. So how much is it going to cost?

The requirement for the POC is 300,000 txs over a 5 day period. That's 6MB per day if we assume transactions are roughly 100B each [[6]]. Ethereum is currently seeing around 6,400 blocks [[7]] mined a day with an average size of 28KB [[7]]. That works out to 179MB a day -- plenty of room for Reddit's 6MBs.

As of EIP-2028 [[8]], that would cost 16 gas per non-zero byte or around 96,000,000 gas a day. A reasonable gas price right now is 22 gwei [[9]], which would come out to 2.112 ether a day. At the current exchange rate of $231 [[10]], that would be approximately $488 a day spent submitting data on-chain. We're simplifying things by not taking into account the intrinsic cost of a transaction [[11]] or any execution in the EVM that will occur, but $500 a day is a reasonable estimate.

A major improvement to this would be batching the signatures together. Unfortunately, the current ECDSA signature scheme that Ethereum uses is not amenable to batching [[12]]. However, BLS [[13]] can prove n signatures in constant time and the specific curve, BLS12-381, has been implemented as part of EIP-2357 [[14]] and has been accepted into the Berlin network upgrade of Ethereum. If we recalculate the daily cost, replacing the tx size with 34 bytes, it would only cost 0.704 ether per day to post all the Community Points txs on-chain.

Some implementations of ORUs that are at varying degrees of production-ready:

Anyway, Matter Labs is one of the most successful and respected zk teams in the space. They are a likely forerunner to getting generic smart contracts running in zk

It's worth noting that they are working on a new programming language, Zinc, made explicitly for writing zk circuits for their zkSync platform, but it's not ready yet

To better understand how they stack up against others, read this page: https://zksync.io/faq/intro.html#zksync-in-comparison (there was also a more in depth blog they did on the differences)

Zk rollups are overall the most secure l2 design. Every state transition is mathematically proven. But for now, there is a temporary cap of 300tps with this solution (expected to get much higher though)

This is all quite interesting for me, since my game (flowerpatch.app) is appraising l2 solutions. Over a month of gas congestion has meant that our profits are pretty much just going straight to the miners...

Overall, MATIC is the most advanced and complete solution, but has some small security tradeoffs. OMG, imo, is behind MATIC, doing very similar tech. OMG and MATIC are both Plasma based, but OMG only handles ERC20/Eth so far. Optimistic Rollups have largely failed, because they require a week long withdraw period, and are generally inferior to zk and plasma's abilities. This zkSync is a big step forward, but, again, only handles basic tx so far. If they can get the tps and smart contract functionality launched, it will probably be the best solution technically",Twitter thread: [https://twitter.com/the\_matter\_labs/status/1273617094031138825](https://twitter.com/the_matter_labs/status/1273617094031138825),"Amazing.

They make way more in fees by not doing so.  Maybe they're misguided on a technical level, maybe not.  But they're doing this at their own expense, so they must be doing it for what is, in their mind, the greater good.  So perhaps not the time to completely shit on them.","Idk why there are so many people saying blocks should be small or stay small. It's legitimately crazy to me

For the record, Ethereum handles just ~1.2mb of data every 10 minutes. This is basically just on par with grandaddy Bitcoin. Yes, that produces about 5gb/month. But what's the actual cost there? I can buy a terabyte ssd hard drive for 120$ currently. That would allow me to store 200 months worth of Ethereum blockchain growth!! That's 16.6 YEARS of storage at current rates. By then, storage may be 100x cheaper again

Meanwhile, we have had absurd fees for months that literally eliminate most use cases. Like, just transferring an NFT costs >1$. Guys this is not cool. This directly fucks up my business, flowerpatch.app, and gives most of our profits to the miners

Even if you truly believe in l2, that only works if we can actually scale the base layer as well. Remember, people need to use l1 to move funds in and out of l2s. Also, l2 adoption is clearly not ready

Meanwhile, ETH is working on several mitigations for the amount of data stored. We have alternate data structures, stateless sync, partial sync, and Eth2 sharding coming up

In short, we have had high fees for 1.5 months, driving out many usecases. The storage need is at the same level as BTC. We need bigger blocks even with l2. Miners are making the right call here, to raise the gas limit!

Edit: one metric that shows whether eth can raise the gas limit is the uncle rates. This signals all green currently, with historic low rates: https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_uncle_rate",Low fees are important for the long term health of the project. Increase the storage gas costs if there is an imbalance don’t lower the max gas limit and stifle the network.

Ethereum is hitting the ceiling really hard right now and has been for a while. Crippling growth and momentum will 100% have major consequences vs increased storage requirements and hypothetical short term ddos attacks.  Those drawbacks are minimal and if serious miners could always respond like they have in the past and lower the limit. There is demand and interest right now and if we turn it away it isn't going to wait around for us to get our shit together.  It will go somewhere else.  Same way Bitcoin lost its massive dev lead when they stagnated.

DeFi projects better take their smart contracts and economics seriously.

I'm not sure why they don't think these things through.  Compound decided to use interest yields as the metric to distribute COMP.  Wasn't it obvious people would game that and over-borrow to drive up their yield curve?  They are now switching now just to gross borrow which is a much fairer and harder to game metric, But according to their blog posts, the update will not be professionally audited (since they say the change is minor)!

I fear this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Unless DeFi platforms think through the game theory of their designs very hard, there are going to be weaknesses and hacks all over the place.

\- Stake is used in many crypto programs for rewards. [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) MCO stake can be unstaked after x days. I believe 180 days?

\- [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) will always be able to pay back your staked tokens because they are not paying back USD equivalent. They are just paying back the number of coins you stake. A lot of their benefits can outweigh any money lost in staking, but not everyone will take advantage of those benefits.

\- [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) most likely uses collateralized loans to help maintain higher interest rates. Though, their earn rates aren't much different than rates found on other platforms like Blockfi. There can be exceptions like Link/USD, but it's very common for corporations to take a loss on certain offers. They don't sit on all your money earning rewards. [A](https://Crypto.com)lso, they have been one of the fastest-growing platforms. Everything would definitely suggest they have a lot extra cash to throw around.

\- You can buy/sell/trade MCO without staking it too

&#x200B;

You have not found a Ponzi. The original holders of every crypto tend to make more profit. The idea of MCO is literally the utility of it. The more people that desire the related service of MCO, the more MCO will be staked out of circulation. Still, there would always be an inflow and outflow of locked MCO. Either way, the biggest benefactor is OBVIOUSLY always [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com). That is why you need to weigh the perks vs the possible loss of value by holding MCO.

We don't know enough about the financials of [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) to make any determination. Even if their current path wasn't sustainable, we wouldn't even know if they intend to change things like their earn interest. There's nothing evil about a corporation offering services/goods at a loss. It's almost impossible to calculate anything without more insight as they have many sources of possible revenue.",Looking at this guy's '3 month history' and +7k karma something doesn't feel right.. goes on posting shit about CDC in every inch of crypto sub on Reddit.

7/3/2020,hkq90t,60,/r/ethereum/comments/hkq90t/fyi_swarm_is_ditching_eth_launching_their_own_bzz/,36,ethereum,"FYI - Swarm is ditching ETH, launching their own BZZ token (ðŸ™„), and going multi-chain...","Here's my point of view.  It should go without saying, but of course none of this represents anyone else's opinion but my own:

A fundamental question for the Ethereum Foundation is: should it narrowly focus on the Ethereum chain or scope widely on web3?   

There's lots of arguments that could be made on either side.   The Ethereum ecosystem is already quite large, and needs lots of attention, and EF has traditionally not done a great job operationally of expanding beyond the purview of Ethereum (probably in part because it was never clear that Ethereum _needed_ native storage/messaging and it's a very different problem from building Ethereum)   

Plus naming anything as the ""Ethereum"" system has a chilling effect, when decentralized messaging and storage are both very wide design spaces.   

Choosing just one as the ""Eth"" solution may be a bad idea - when it's quite possible that multiple storage systems will be used for different things by devs building on Ethereum who prefer one set of tradeoffs versus another.  On the other hand, sometimes it is great to have things natively integrated.  It's the vision that many of us bought into.

With Swarm in particular, many folks around the project that I've talked to felt like Swarm was in a little bit of a lose/lose situation.  EF has nearly run out of money a few times in its history, and iirc Swarm got mostly cutoff one of those times.  There was never a chance that Swarm would be funded to the tune of hundreds of millions like Filecoin, nor was there necessarily the confidence that it should be, given how huge/ambitious the scope of Swarm has become and that it was still dealing with fundamental r&d.

From what I understand, Swarm and EF made the decision that Swarm would go stand on its own.  The Swarm team went out and got funding from Rootstock and ETC and decided to do a pre-sale of their token, so of course given the funding that they took, the approach will include ETC and Rootstock.

Swarm has been around for about 6 years, and this month published their white paper called the Book of Swarm:  https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/

I've checked with a lot of people and some think it is quite impressive academic research but it's also still a decent way away from execution.  That's Swarm's challenge right now.

This a long way of saying: I don't think it's fair to call this a money grab from the Swarm team.  It's fine to feel disappointed about who their investors are; it certainly isn't an Ethereum-centric vision anymore.  If executed successfully, Swarm will eventually be one of many decentralized storage tools for Eth developers.  If you want to support that journey with Swarm, then there's a token you can buy.","It’d be interesting to know what support the Swarm team received from the EF over the years, and how it ended up diverging from Etheruem. For a long time there was a prototype Swarm client included in Geth, but I remember a bit of a Twitter spat between @peter_szilagyi and @zeligf where Peter seemed obviously frustrated that after so many years the Swarm client basically didn’t work. I think perhaps he saw the Swarm client as bloat on Geth.

That after all this time they’ve decided to do a crowdsale is a real disappointment.","What’s the solution and how can all dev teams learn from this? 

There’s clearly a problem if there’s essentially unanimous surprise regarding the swarm teams decision (here as well as on /r/ethswarm). 

Whether it’s a lack of communication, an issue of ethics, a safety of the data issue (like what some of the BTC on ETH bridges worry about), etc., there’s clearly an issue and the entire ecosystem needs to discuss and can likely learn from it.

Loom, Raiden, OMG, RPL, etc. The list goes on. When are these teams going to rally around ETH and stop opting for the easy money grab + adding friction to this ecosystem.

This highlights yet again why fundraising needs to be contingent on milestones, not a complete handover of funds up front (EF, ICO, And Gitcoin funding included)."

I even took the time to go and do a little test drive. 
I placed bets on a few items and launched one of my own. ( https://omen.eth.link/#/0x9a4a884216e229eec51946314b9df370cb2d3e8e )


My first impressions:

1) It looks like it is up and working! No obvious failures. I have a little bit of UI feedback that I will get to, but pretty good for an early launch

2) It's pretty obviously *empty* in there.  I know you just fired it up, but it's like a great party space with no one in it. This is a big problem. I would suggest that the Omen staff sit down and create/bet on a bunch of predictions so that there is a somewhat meaningful selection of things to interact with.  

3) From a UI perspective, they *need* to get a ""show me the bets I hold positions in"" filter in there. 

4) From a UI perspective, it would be nice if when creating a market you could set or change the percentages after typing in all your options. Less critical, but it would also be nice if you could change the order of your options after they were typed in. 

I will try to stop back by this comment in a week, when some of my bets have closed, and describe how that process went.",'agnostic' oracle seems like it will be problematic down the line.,"""A side-by-side comparison between Omen and Augur as taken from @gnosisPM's recent blog.

This architecture is bad for the interoperability of assets also. If for some reason a smart contract is not popular, the investment funds participating in it lose their reputation.”

I struggle to understand your point that public data on financial transactions in DeFi reduces the interoperability of assets. Doesn’t game theory, history, and common sense prove that two unfamiliar entities will be willing to “interoperate” (interact) if all relevant data of their potential behavior, liquidity, and credit worthiness is completely public? In my mind it seems that public financial data is positively correlated with interoperability in a financial ecosystem - this is the same reason many of the largest private entities in traditional finance have to regularly report their activity in public despite their “private” status. 

Additionally, you mention that investment funds would lose their “reputations”. Lack of clarity on this point aside, don’t any funds in an underperforming or suboptimal smart contract/protocol simply get reallocated (in a public way) to those with more promise? I struggle to understand how “funds” can lose “reputation” - In my mind the reallocation of assets into better protocols and markets do nothing but make the market more efficient and create value for investors. This is the same reason bad stocks are not included in the S&P500, for instance. Do you have any clarity to add to these points? I struggle to understand the claims that more privacy would somehow add to the efficiency of DeFi rather than detract from it.","What can you do in DeFi that you can't do in regular finance?

Bitcoin made transactions faster, cheaper, and available to people where banks can't reach. Is DeFi somehow faster or more profitable or something?","[**u/vbuterin**](https://www.reddit.com/user/vbuterin/) **why did you hide my post from the others?

EIP 1559 will solve the problem of miners spamming the network, at the same time as improving the UX, at the same time as reducing inflation.","Could someone help me understand why this proposal includes a tipping fee to miners and relies on the assumption that high gas prices acts like a deterrent? Isn't this design just a different way of replicating the same functions as we have with the current system + burning some ETH? 

- Issue 1: miners have economic incentive to include the transactions that pay highest

- Solution: implement a system where users can pay more to get their transaction included

- Issue 2: network is operating at full capacity, raising the gas limit has never solved the issue, rising gas prices hasn't acted as a deterrent

- Solution: Increase the gas limit and increase gas prices slightly when network is busy

Why wouldn't this just result in every block being full and the basefee being at a constant max and users engaging in a bidding war of tips to make sure their txs are included? Doesn't the inclusion of tips make this design unpredictable just like the current system? 

I hope I'm misunderstanding something and someone would correct me","Why am I not surprised there are no links to the modeling that show that fees for the average user will be orders of magnitude larger during any sustained periods of congestion?

Even 100 blocks being full push the amount a user must pay to include their transaction beyond the current fee levels.

No amount of motivated reasoning makes this change a net benefit for the network. The only set of users who benefit from this EIP are bagholders hoping additional deflationary pressure will cut supply and increase the dollar value of their coins.

And even then it's not guaranteed, especially if it kills network usage."

Built by Ethereum developers, for Ethereum developers.","While many dApps are emerging every months, the complex buying process creates still barriers to Ethereum and DeFi mass adoption, as billions of adults don't have the necessary bank account to buy ether or ERC20 tokens to interact with a particular Ethereum app. 

Whether you're working on a decentralized application, a wallet, an exchange, a protocol, or simply an application that uses Ethereum, the Dether protocol is here to help you create a bridge between cash and your Ethereum-based solution.

With the Dether protocol, you can: 

**1. Add a cash-to-crypto on/off ramp for your app** 

**2. Give your users the ability to cash-in/cash-out their cryptocurrency** in a peer-to-peer way. 

**3. Build new applications on top of the Dether protocol** and save time trying to solve the first and last mile crypto issue. 

**4. Charge fees on stakings** that happen on your application (if you wish to). 

&#x200B;

What can you build using the Dether protocol? Here is a non-exhaustive **list of uses cases**

Local P2P Market 🏪

Create your local P2P market by enabling individuals & retailers in your area to trade any crypto, goods, or service without a middleman. Just like a decentralized eBay

Remittance 💸

Disrupt u/WesternUnion u/MoneyGram that take major fees by building an international network of tellers that transfer fiat currencies from point A to point B while benefiting from crypto's speed. 

Crypto Cash-in/out Gateway 📱

Welcome unbanked populations in your dApp by adding a cash-to-crypto gateway for them. Any cash holder will have a technical solution to join and start using your dApp.

Endless possibility 💥

Anything you can imagine on top of a network of crypto buyers and sellers. 

&#x200B;

For example the blog post you listed explaining atomic swaps mentions swapping ETH / BTC 

As far as I can tell you can’t actually do that on Switcheo 

In order to do so on Switcheo you have to go to a different exchange, buy DAI or Dollar pegged coin 

Swap it for ETH (or buy ETH from afore mentioned separate exchange) 

Then swap it for wBTC 

Then find an exchange that will allow exchange from wBTC to BTC? 

Please correct me if I’m wrong but I will also incur Fx fees on each one of those trades 

That’s a completely different proposition than “you can atomic swap ETH to BTC easily for 2 years on Switcheo”",Keep the news rolling,"Beat it mate

I’d wager that very few people have 32 ETH and fewer of them are willing to risk them.,"There are three big reasons the total staked Ether might not be as high as people think.

1. You can already earn 3-7% APY compounded monthly for lending your ETH. 
2. 32 ETH minimum may be too high.
3. Eth staked on ETH 2.0 will be virtually unusable for at least 1 year, more likely 2 years. It isn't until phase 1.5 that it will start to have any real purpose. Do people really want to lock their ETH up for that long? 

Here are some counter arguments however:

1. ETH 2.0 may yield up to 20% 
2. 32 ETH minimum may be a high barrier now but for those that hodled since the $2 price range will have plenty. This means there may be whales locking up thousands or tens of thousands of ETH by themselves.
3. There are pools for staking less than 32.
4. Long term hodlers won't care to lock their ETH up and wait 1-2 years for it to be useful."

One bit of recent [news](https://provide.services/baselining-the-north-america-coca-cola-bottling-supply-chain/) is that the Coca-Cola bottling supply chain in North America is going to use the public Ethereum chain, building on a system from EY that gives corporations a way to do that sort of thing with strong privacy.

Also, the public ETH2 testnet just went live, which puts us on track for deploying proof of stake this year. Several implementations of ""rollups"" are live, which are layer-2 systems that enable thousands of transactions per second on today's Ethereum with security equivalent to putting transactions directly on chain. And with ETH2 on track, it's looking good for getting phase 1 sharding next year, which multiplies the capacity of rollups by a factor of 512.

So for simple things like transfers and exchanges, we're looking at a capacity of hundreds of thousands per second by the end of next year. A while back I did some googling and figured out that's enough for all the USD payments in the US plus all the trades on NASDAQ, with room to spare.","My view of eth's future is:

ethereum 1.0: Let the users remove the middle man in their financial transactions. They can create decentralized organizations where trust is not necessary. Think a decentralized Uber or AirBnB. Lack of middlemen create opportunity and lower costs.

But wait, why haven't a decentralized Uber or AirBnB kicked their legacy competition in the groin? Because of the limited throughput of today's ethereum a mass market can never be reached. Thereby no network effect.

ethereum 2.0: Let's scale this! Also if ethereum is to be the world financial computer, we can't do PoW (proof of work) since the value of eth would be so high that an insane amount of CO2 would be emitted to secure the network. Hence PoS (proof of stake).

DeFi: Necessary since real large scale economical activity can't happen around an asset like eth that is volatile to say the least. But driving the price as some claim? If true it's just another destructive bubble.

Cool apps today: Golem, take a look!

Cool apps in the future: Swarm, could revolutionize the internet. Will super-charge innovation on the net if successful. Will crush any censorship, for good or for bad.

No one knows if eth2.0 will be successful technologically. No one knows if ethereum can hold on to its first mover advantage. No one knows if crypto will revolutionize the world."

I did search around, but I don't really see much that talks about validator latency or bandwidth. Shocking, I know.

These requirements also cannot be made in bubble...because there are actually 3 things needed to be a validator.

1. An ETH1 Node
2. A Beacon Node
3. A Validator Node

A Validator connects to a Beacon Node.

A Beacon Node connects to other Beacon Nodes AND it connects to an ETH1 node.

ETH1 nodes connect to other ETH1 nodes, obviously.

You don't HAVE to run all of these yourself...but you probably should. Which means you have to consider the bandwidth requirements for an ETH1 node, and a Beacon Node. They're what go out and talk to the rest of the network. The validator only talks to the Beacon Node, so it's not all that important.  


EDIT: Oh and I should point out that there's no simple solution for high availability either. You can't run multiple validator nodes, they'd slash each other. You can run multiple beacon nodes but there's no best practice method for load balancing them, same goes for the ETH1 nodes. So...if you're going to run your own setup, you'd better have some stable and reliable hardware ;)",Have a look at /r/ethstaker . Full of documentation,

Most stocks don't even offer dividends. They are just bullshit paper without any relevance to the company beyond advertising for private capital raises.

Tokens typically offer benefits within the ecosystem, voting rights, yield, etc.

Bringing accountability back to the stock market. Skin in the game. Huge improvement.

Nevertheless some tokens, like many stocks, are still crap.","It's useful for a sharded ecosystem or seperate-chain like Polkodot or Cosmos is working on -- but how ETH is currently structured it's useless garbage in most cases that just was a way to raise funds.

Imo coins like Kyber, 0x, Loopring, and Omisego are going to 0 in the long-term and have sold them all recently after coming to this conclusion. 

The only case this isn't the case is in the case of projects like REN, SNX (lesser extent), BAND, LINK, and others that use the token as collateral/hostage for node-operators, but ultimately such tokens prices are determined by network-security requirements, much like Ethers price will be in the future, rather than actual adoption. This means you need to price them differently -- they're based on network value and the security demanded by it's users, not adoption. Link could provide oracles for everything in the world, but remain at $20/coin if there's no need to have more collateral locked up in the case of a naughty node operator -- this is especially true when t comes to when many oracles come out, as if one operator is behaving badly the contract could ignore them, and thus they wouldn't be as reliant, and thus need less collateral to be locked in case they behave wrong as less impact would be had by such behavior."

Eth2, first and foremost, is a layer 1 data availability machine, providing ~100x more layer 1 data. This data can be leveraged by rollups for massively more scale and rollup diversity

It's normally created in JSON format when you compile the code.

For example, this is the YFI token - someone has uploaded the source code to Etherscan, so it can show you the ABI data.
https://etherscan.io/address/0x0bc529c00C6401aEF6D220BE8C6Ea1667F6Ad93e#code

If the contract you're calling is written in Solidity and you've got its source code, you can generate the ABI yourself with something like `solc --abi WhateverToken.sol`.

However, the `balanceOf(address addr)` call of a token contract is standardized, so it should look the same for all tokens unless they're really weirdly written. So even if you don't have the source code of that token, you should be able to use the ABI of a different token, or just make it yourself.",,

High gas prices do make a lot of arbitrage unprofitable. You need volatility. Check for that [here](https://www.orfeed.org/defiarbfinder/#) (scroll down). In times of high volatility and/or low gas prices and/or with huge amounts at stake, gas prices become trivial and profit via arbitrage may be possible.

There are services popping up to help in these regards in any case e.g. [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/) lets you create any type of flash loan you want, without code.  [Tutorial: Create Flashloan Combo on Furucombo](https://medium.com/furucombo/create-flashloan-combo-on-furucombo-c7c3b23267f0). At these gas prices, don't even bother, unless you are trading with big numbers.

Of course, the more people doing this, the more efficient the market becomes and the less opportunityfor arbitrage there is. Youtube channels like [Proof Suite](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKDNphVF9TItP7PP9wJPM6g/videos) are good places to learn all of the above.",Good questions.

So if you have a project that only works if you have a token that you can increase its supply then its a good candidate for using a custom token.

Of course a lot of projects will find ways to use their own token as a funding mechanism even if a token is not needed by the project because either they just want money or they recognize that the project would not get funded otherwise (little bit of column A, little bit of column B for some projects)

An example of a use case where you might want to be able to inflate the supply is in a governance token. You might want to issue new tokens to users who do desired tasks or burn tokens of users who do undesired tasks. You can also burn tokens to cause deflation as a reward to all holders and issue tokens to cause inflation as a punishment. MakerDAO MKR governance token has this property where if loans in their system fail new MKR tokens are issued to both buy back excess stablecoins and to punish MKR holders for the bad governance of loans. 

A good rule of thumb for me is to ask whether app token holders have to do some sort of work. If not then whatever project has the token could probably be re-written without them to make the system better.",[removed],

1. I made original payment from nano ledger, can I replace the transaction sending the 0ETH txn from ledger again? 
Or 
Do I need to replace the txn from my etherwallet? If so.... how do I replace the txn from a different “from” address? 

2. Also can I leave the “to” address as the same? So the payment makes it to where I wanted it to go? Or do I need to redirect it to myself? In which case surely I can’t replace the transaction through MEW as both the to and from address would be different?

I think the thing you are looking for is the ERC721 token standard. have a look at the openzeppelin implementation here: [https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc721)

just inherit from it and define your specific properties (don't attempt to write it on your own, solidity has lots of pitfalls)

I don't exactly get the passcode part of your code. i think you are still thinking in old web2 terms. with the new paradigm you would not need this since you private key is your ""passcode"".

if you want to understand these token standards from the ground up i would suggest the tutorials from loom that can be found here: [https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/)

hope this helps.

good luck. and stay save. :)

also i always have to write to the mods to green light my posts since i don't have the 20 karma to post here. so i would appreciate if you could upvote this, i am missing 2 karma, so i can finally post in this reddit without always bothering the mods ;)","Why would you need a ""passcode"" what is wrong with ethereum's built in security?  Solidity allows you to set it up so only the owners address can pass ownership.  The passcode is signing the transaction to transfer the asset.",I think you're looking for an NFT for the car. Then the owner of the token is the owner of the car and they can transfer the token.

Action 'Repay Debt':
1. Wallet sends 500(ish) DAI to DSProxy
2. DSProxy burns the DAI
3. MakerDAO subtracts repayed DAI mount from debt
4. There is no debt => Market buy WETH and add WETH to vault
5. Automagically withdraw the market bought WETH

All these transactions can be followed, I'm certain now that you did get your DAI back in the form of ETH.

If participation drops below 2/3 then the inactivity leak starts picking up, motivating all the 25% stakers who were offline to start really making sure they are online. The equilibrium is that the participation level will just continue hugging the 2/3 line and we see finality at a slower rate than usual but still happening (eg. once every 5-50 epochs), until the attack eventually ends. We've basically lived through this exact situation for a couple of days on Medalla; the network can handle it fine.","LOL article should be called, Cost to attack eth 2.0: 10s of millions of USD, cost to attack POW chains: hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Someone can just 51% attack a POW blockchain and just not put in any transactions.  It would have the same effect.  It would be cheaper just to attack eth 1.0 before 2.0 comes out.  Also there's a benefit to 51% attack where you can reverse transactions equal to the time you've 51% attacked the network.  What do you get for stopping the eth 2.0 network for an hour?","> “Let’s assume that 10% of the ETH is now staking and that network participation is 75% (which is pretty much what we see on testnet now). In this case to drop the participation rate by 9% to halt the chain only requires control of 0.9% of the ETH in circulation. Certainly achievable by a large whale or a mid size exchange,” Yaffe told Decrypt. 

0.9% is about $369M at current prices. So a whale or exchanges would be the culprits of such an attack."

A centralized service, 1broker offered ""synthetic"" longs and shorts on forex, crypto, and stocks.

The first threat 1broker faced was the fact that they were offering infinite liquidity with insane leverage. The only way the operators could mitigate this risk was by having ludicrously high fees. 

The second and biggest threat was regulation, and of course, this was ultimately took them down. SEC and CFTC were all over them with securities law violations. Soon after, their domain was seized and they were forced to pay fines and disgorgement.

The third major threat, that 1broker didn't face, is the SNX token structure. As Frameworks Venture's Vance Spencer put it, the token's value is recursive both to the upside--and to the downside. 

Of course, they have made strides to address these issues; for example, by increasing decentralization, holding off on offering leveraged products, and encouraging stakers to use their sUSD to follow the global synth portfolio. 

That's just my viewpoint as a former 1broker user and someone who's waiting for an SNX entry. I'm sure the token will blow up, one way or another.",I don’t see how it’s too different from the typical derivatives market. Why not bring that on chain? It’s done regularly anyways,">Their inherently speculative nature makes derivatives a game of Jenga that inevitably collapses.

Isn't that part of the crypto fun? It's not a roller coaster if it doesn't go down once in a while."

However, there's a limit to how many unmined transactions a node can queue, so if there are lots of other transactions around with higher gas prices waiting to get into a block, other nodes in the network may stop broadcasting your transaction and forget about it. If that happens your wallet would normally be able to rebroadcast it. Depending on the wallet it may do that automatically if you just leave it open, or it may be too stupid to know how to rebroadcast it at all, or you might need to take some kind of action to prod it into resending like increasing the gas price 1 gwei.",

How does this even work (not work)?

One of the leading L2 devs recently said this to me on discord:

>Hey Zach!!! :slight\_smile: Totally agree - Eliminating browser extensions / etc will be huge! Our approach for handling this is actually pretty minimalistic. We are working extremely hard to provide all of the same APIs and tools that we have on Ethereum main-chain. The reason for this is because we want to make sure that all of the great work on meta-transactions, burner wallets, etc can be seamlessly utilized on \[**redacted**\]. So instead of us building the tools, we're building support for the awesome existing (/soon to exist) tools!  
>  
>That said, my personal opinion on how these tools will integrate is that we will see light-weight wallets which are integrated directly into applications that provide the key-signing / backup functionality. And then on top of that, we'll see more and more sophisticated ways in which frontends can be built that ensure users are not being lied to by their application about what actions they're taking / what their balance is, etc. Vitalik always wants a really good ""auto-generate frontend"" which is great for this purpose but those can be hard to make look good / stylish enough",,

For me it's a lot of unjustified hype for something which is basically just a simple gossiping algorithm + stake,"> It is currently not finalized how it will be released but at least Ethereum holders will receive 1:1 Athereum. It is still to be discussed if ERC-20 tokens will also be included and if big whales will receive a cap when airdropping ATH.

I don't understand this, aren't ATH just the ""ETH"" balances that you get when you move the state over?

Its success proves that proof of work based Nakamoto consensus, the consensus mechanism pioneered and used by Bitcoin, is viable through fees.

I think the exact opposite happened, high fees on ethereum proved that arbitrarily reducing throughput to increase total fees doesn't work. Don't forget bitcoin started at 100% domination and 100% of all fees. Fees on bitcoin are now slowly trending to zero, as even the only remaining use case - speculation on bitcoin - is moving to ethereum, with ethereum's congestion as the only blocker to a full switch.  

https://btconethereum.com/  
Given the recent attack on Bitmex, kycless leverage trading is only going to survive on ethereum, so even btc speculators are going to be forced to use wrapped btc.  

Ethereum has a much stronger network effect because of interacting smart contracts, but without scaling it would get replaced eventually too, probably also by wrapping eth and erc20 tokens.  
Fortunately turing complete smart contracts make trustless layer2 scaling actually possible via rollups.",,

Each shard will have it's own gas price, and the ETH 1 shard will likely be the most expensive.

If you need to do complex, high-value DeFi  swaps, you'll probably stay on the ETH 1 shard.

But if you're just moving tokens, doing small trades or building a new application, it's much cheaper to use a different shard.",proxy contracts will allow using eth1 shard into other shards,"It's a possibility but unlikely to happen in reality. Eventually the ETH 1 shard will become too expensive and people will use the other ones. Other new contracts might be more interested in a fresh shard, etc.

Shard specialization and heavy use / lack of use of certain shards is being predicted by some though, so expect some shards be very different in fees and things available than others.

Alternatively, if that rollup-centric plan actually comes to fruition, shards might be used even less so might even resemble less to that image of smart contacts on the ETH 2 base layer and shards could be used for things more generic like storage and such while most contracts being developed on top of L2.

For both it's too soon to tell as functional ETH 2 is at least 2-3 years away and L2 composability is non-existent."

I'd pay for everything in crypto if I could. A wallet which would automatically convert currencies through a decentralized exchange would be good, but the real problem is finding vendors which accept crypto in the first place.

2. No, but I'm considering it to provide liquidity through DeFi. I don't want to 2 expose all my savings to the volatility of crypto, but this would allow me to take advantage of a better interest rate.

3. No. The only payments I receive are fiat from my employer.

4. I don't know what venmo is.",Why not use the OMG Network? Stellar is not decentralized.,"1. Difficulty finding vendors who accept crypto. Even successful payments are complicated by tediously subtracting the exact transaction fee and potentially also accounting for any fees if I'm using a swap service or something. And then the inevitable excruciating 10 to 45 minutes as I wait for it to be confirmed and worry that I input something in wrong. So I tend to avoid it...

2. Yes, to take advantage of interest rates

3. No. Keybase makes p2p payment easy with people I know.

4. Probably not. I only use Venmo if that's all the person will accept, but otherwise I don't really mess around with it much. Maybe it's just a matter of my annoyance with the social network element of it, I dunno."

10/20/2020,jen4jp,4,/r/ethereum/comments/jen4jp/is_the_ethereum_network_a_public_good_thoughts/,1,ethereum,"Is the Ethereum network a ""Public good"", thoughts?","Interesting question. What you could explore is whether open source software is a public good. I say it is. So Ethereum the software is a public good. But is the Ethereum network? I don't think so. You have to pay to use it. It's not free. Sanitation and street lights are paid for by tax payers but you don't actively pay each time you use them. But you do have to pay to use the Ethereum network every time you use it. Ether is probably a commodity like gas or oil as you pointed out.

I see three distinct things here, Ethereum the network, Ether the gas, but also the open source software published by all of the developers. I don't know if people generally see that as separate but it is. You can download the software, tweak the settings and spin up a complete blockchain network with its own crypto called Freether with zero transaction fees. You could be the only miner and make the hash difficulty zero and charge zero minining fees. In that scenario the network is a public good and freely available to everyone to use. You a private citizen (or a government entity) would be paying to maintain the network in the form of electricity and hardware. That sounds like a public good to me.

So the software is a public good. But also, and separate, you could create a blockchain using that software that has the characteristics of a public good.


Interesting topic. Good luck!","Perhaps under Paul Samuelson's strict definition as you have stated it, Ethereum mainnet is not a public good. However it can be said that under this definition few things actually are, because all public resources must exclude access in some way. Answering this question probably requires a lot more research on Samuelson's work, and I can see that there is a lot there! 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuelson_condition

> the public good should be provided as long as the overall benefits to consumers from that good are at least as great as the cost of providing it

Would incorporating some of that cost directly to the user, or restricting their access automatically disqualify it as a public good? It seems impractical. A public park has hours of operation. A court charges fees to its users. Fisheries can be depleted, and fishing boats coordinate to restrict access in order to ensure that the resource is sustainable.

The Ethereum network requires ETH in order to be economically sustainable and to maximize access to the resource. This cost is a reasonable and pragmatic attribute, necessary to maintain this commons in good working order.","You're right. Being Non-excludable is not a property of Ethereum. You need to pay gas to use it by design. Because non-paying users are by definition prevented from accessing it. Its software, same as all open source software, is public goods however because anybody could access it, manipulate it, compile it and nobody needs to pay to access it.

Even I wouldn't consider Ethereum non-rival either (consumption by one person does not reduce the amount available for others). As we've have seen that the block consumption of users have reduced the available block space to the point where only people paying high fees are able to use it.

Anti-rival is a better definition if you approve of Steven Weber's ideas, as most software networks created by people it becomes more valuable when more people use it.

If he doesn’t, the contract will recognise that he didn’t get good grades and resend the money back to me.

With proof-of-work, supply is very expensive to holders (whose tokens get diluted) and damaging to the environment. So you want as little supply as possible, consistent with sufficient security.

We don't know how much supply will be needed to pay for sufficient security in future. If you set a cap, and you reach it, and you don't have enough security, your system becomes insecure. This would be bad, so there's no cap.

Since cryptocurrencies can be changed if the people using them change their software, no cryptocurrency really has an unbreakable cap. Bitcoin has a strong ""social consensus"" that new supply will keep decreasing and eventually stop, then security will be paid for by transaction fees. But nobody knows if transaction fees will really be enough to keep bitcoin working securely, and if they're not, either Bitcoin breaks or the social consensus changes and they ignore the cap and increase issuance.",I wouldn't worry about it. They have been reducing rewards and EIP-1559 would burn a portion of the transaction fees. If anything inflation will be around Bitcoin levels. They are committed to reducing it.,Because its absolutely not sure that fees alone are sufficient enough to pay the miners/stakers to run the network as soon the max is reached.

  * Isn't used in commerce
  * Doesn't have any revenue
  * Is bought in the expectation that it's going to go up.

Such things are quite common in this space, and for the average investor, such a thing can't possibly work: It's a pure negative-sum game, any profit that one investor appears to make can only come from an equal and opposite loss by some other investor. It will appear to work because people will look at their paper profits, multiplying the coin price by the number of coins they hold, but the money they think they've got doesn't exist anywhere, and if they all tried to cash out then they couldn't.

He's also probably right about proof-of-work ETH. It's not really used as money (let's be honest), and it's strictly negative-sum: Money is constantly drained from the system to pay for mining, and that money comes from new investors. If we had EIP1559, and the fees burned were greater than the block reward, then it would become positive-sum, and at that point it starts to look more like a regular investment: You lock up some capital, it creates value for somebody, they pay it in fees, the fees are higher than the operating costs, and the resulting profits go the [token|stock] holders.

Once PoW stops the value proposition is much clearer, because the operating costs are trivial (the costs of running validator nodes) so it's way easier to turn a profit. It's also easier to grok as an investment if the fees arrive in the form of *revenue* rather than a block reward or a burn, but ultimately it doesn't really matter - all that matters is that value is created, and it's captured by token holders, either all of them or just those who stake. This is fairly conventional economics, and I think it's actually something that Buffett would understand if he took the time to look at it.",

I just saw the launchpad link with how to send Eth but other then that? Those daily Vitalik breadcrumb throwing on twitter about less slashing, less uptime requirements, etc is what should have been written from the beginning in a comprehensive documentation. Most people with 32eth would probably take an hour of their time and read this guide before thinking of sending 14k$ to some contract blackhole.

The Cardano POS rollout has been butter smooth in comparison to ETH. 

But that one-way dynamic with indefinite locking does indeed seem to spook way too many people. Testnet participation rates has been abysmal as well. Too many engineers and not enough game theoretists on the Eth team to predict such an outcome?

Note that although the gas *used* by the first one was lower than 136,833, you often need a higher limit than you end up using. This is because some operations (like when you delete something from storage) end up freeing up storage, and that gets you a refund, but the refund isn't applied until the end of the transaction.

In general, more demand can cause value to increase, but there are many macro factors that could cause an equal amount of supply to flood the market.

TLDR; maybe.","As long as eth is mined, there's no direct connection between adoption and price. Adoption manifests itself as higher total fees, but miners are free to dump it all instantly, which means there's no price appreciation. At best, it works as a way to market eth to speculators.  

This changes a bit after fee burning is going to be introduced, as higher fees would cancel part of rewards to miners, potentially even leading to deflation (but that's unlikely given how high the inflation currently is).  
This changes drastically after mining is gone, for two reasons: as inflation is going to be cut a lot, deflation is much more likely - in fact given current fees it would already be happening.  

Secondly, staking is going to be extremely cheap resource-wise (like below one million dollars *annually*, compared to several millions per *day* now), so there's nothing forcing stakers to dump a majority of their eth income just to pay bills, meaning all paid fees are likely to end up as effective deflation for a long time.  

To summarize, currently, not really. In a year, a tiny bit (assuming eip1559). After full PoS (2022?) - yes. The change is going to be drastic - from ethereum burning billions of dollars per year to function, to ethereum generating hundreds of millions (potentially billions, assuming adoption grows) per year.",Most do not understand that protocols and services are built on Ethereum network.  More adoption could occur but affect the tokens in Ethereum without moving the price of Eth.  Defi is a good example.  You would see 100x moves in defi alts but Eth would displace less than 10%.

A simple plan B is to change the *min\_genesis\_active\_validator\_count* to whatever validator number is present on November 24 to allow eth2 to start on 1st December.

I ask because the ETH economy has changed enormously since the planning of eth2 started with many options now available to obtain high yields from ETH. Today there is no logical reason to have a minimum of 16,384 validators as a requirement to start the eth2 chain. Game/economic/greed theory suggests that people will FOMO into something if there is a known financial reward greater than exists elsewhere. Furthermore, people get upset because of opportunity cost losses if they deposit ETH into a contract and it does not start producing rewards because the future start date of earning rewards is an unknown or individuals withhold depositing until a start date is known. Also, don’t forget about giving an advantage to POS competitors by delaying the eth2 launch.

&#x200B;

 Edit 18 Nov. 

It is now apparent that pool funds like Rocket Pool will not be able to send funds to the deposit contract until sometime in 2021 which excludes people with less than 32 ETH from participating in eth2 until contract interactions with the deposit contract are sorted. This may also be the case for other pool funds.

It would be great if the 16,384 validator number is achieved by November 24 as it has been a long hard road for the eth2 research team over the years and the eth2 client developers (with community help) and they deserve a successful genesis launch. However, nobody likes uncertainty and regardless of what plan B is it would be a very bad look if the EF does not articulate a plan B by November 24, better to be proactive rather than reactive. Imagine the coindesk headlines if there is silence.

The point to invest 32 eth is you getting a very high reward initially (chart on launchpad ethereum says 21.6%/year), decreasing as more validators join in. Yes there is still a risk
No you cant participate to the launch with less than 32 ethers, you'll have to wait until pool solutions are ready.
If we dont reach the min. amount by genesis date, is automatically postponed by one week (by code), until is reached.
Keep in mind that lots of people are still installing, trying it out,.. there were still a few small issues on testnet until yesterday so we could see an increase in deposits in the next days. People might be reluctant to put real 32 ethers on mainnet until they manage to get it to work on testnet :)",Mods we need a stickied thread/FAQ thing,

Ideally you would run a server yourself, or at least rent it. It's also possible to stake eth in a custodial pool (they charge fees though).  
https://launchpad.ethereum.org/  
https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-pyrmont-prysm-a10b5129c7e3 it's a guide for a testnet, but mainnet is going to be almost identical.","Staking is like the new mining, they both run the network and they both earn rewards. It won't affect regular users on the front end because regular users don't set up mining rigs or in this case, validating nodes. However, when staking services come online in the future, you'll be able to send your ETH to them and they will stake for you so you can earn some passive income. By that point, be careful of scams and people asking you to send your ETH to them for staking.

If you really want to stake now, and if you hold other alts, check out the ones you hold, they may have delegated Proof of Stake, which is basically what I described above but built-in to the wallets. Cardano and Polkadot are some examples, and they are non-custodial, meaning you keep your money. It's just like a bank account that earns interest passively to keep up with dollar inflation. It doesn't cause any restriction either on your money."

Think the same but in real life, for each 5$ bill someone gives to you, you destroy it and sign a paper saying that is 5$, nobody would do that","Your mechanism prevents the price from rising above $1 - if the price of your token goes up people can burn ETH to mint more and sell it for a profit - but it doesn't protect from downward price movement.

Basically is the first step to go from proof of work (mining coins through server grind) to proof of stake ( nodes that have more than 32 eth locked inside validate and generarte coins)

Pos is better than pow, because its less taxing on the environment and allows more tx","The update on dec 1 does not change anything for normal ethereum users. It is an intermediate step toward future updates that aim at reducing electricity cost and improving transaction throughput. Those updates come later though.

The planned updates are:
- use eth2 as collateral instead of burning electricity to secure the network. this also boosts tx rate by about 2x because blocks are created at a more consistent frequency
- use zkSNARK rollups like zksync.io to only record summaries of several transactions instead of all individual transactions on chain. this will be about a 100x boost to tx rate.
- split up the blockchain into multiple shards that live next to each other so that it is no longer necessary for every node to validate each individual transaction thats happening. should be another 20x boost.
- enable lightweight clients that can sync quickly without compromising security.

estimates are just ballpark, for now nothing changes. there is a new eth2 chain to start gathering experience with proof of stake, and you can run a validator on that new eth2 chain to earn interest. but eth2 does not support basic transactions like transfers or withdrawals at this time. eventually as eth2 reaches feature parity with eth1 all eth1 will be migrated to eth2 and mining with electricity is no longer used.","Super tldr:

Transactions per second

Btc : 3-5

Eth : 15

Visa : 1400

Eth2.0 : 100,000


Mining:

Btc : need a warehouse of machines to compete

Eth : need a lot of gpus

Eth2.0 : need 32 eth and a computer to make 3-5% per year.


So right now if you want to send something on eth or write something into the chain, it costs like 5 bucks. Eth2 is going to make the price much lower. You could then use eth2 for apps that record gps data for instance where now it wouldn’t be feasible."

There's a tendency in this space for the loudest voices to be people who have something to hype, which is often quite shady. Progressive policy wonks will have their mental shields up against fintech flimflam. They won't be persuaded by just saying ""you will destroy this wonderful business opportunity for people trying to make money"", you need to be able to explain how you're making society better, and that's what the people working on the tech mostly care about, but I'm not sure it's always communicated to a wider audience.","She's not trying to protect you with this bill.

**WARNING: long technical answer incoming but I have tried to make it as accessible as a technical deep dive realistically can be.**

First of all, a voting system has many very specific requirements that it must meet in order to be secure, some of which are counterintuitive and stricter than what you might expect. Paper-based voting satisfies all of these requirements. There are different ways of stating these requirements; this is simply my presentation.

* Correctness (the result actually is the correct result given what the votes were, and each voter can only vote once)
* Only registered voters can vote (this is easy: the voting authority maintains a list of public keys and enforces the one-per-person rule, and this can be made publicly verifiable)
* Censorship resistance (if you want to vote and are eligible, nobody can prevent you from voting, and your vote gets counted)
* Privacy (no one can see how you voted, or even whether or not you voted)
* Coercion resistance (you can't prove to a third party how you voted, even if you wanted to and even if you and the third party were cooperating throughout the process)

The first and third can be solved easily with ZK-SNARKs; it would be a simple retool of Zcash or tornado.cash. The second can be provided with a blockchain (yay!). But the fourth (very important to prevent selling votes) is much harder.

It turns out that there is cryptographic technology that can solve the fourth, but it requires a trusted intermediary. It basically involves everyone publishing their votes encrypted with the intermediary's public key, and the intermediary publishes a ZK-SNARK of decrypting the messages and verifying the result (there's also a bit of trickery that allows voters to change their keys to trick anyone trying to coerce them or buy their vote). The intermediary has no way to break the first three guarantees, but they can do one of two nasty things:

1. They can prevent anyone from learning the result at all, forcing the election to be repeated with a different intermediary
2. They can run a trustless vote selling marketplace

This is actually already not that bad, because both forms of attack are highly visible and can lead to the intermediary being quickly replaced. But if we want added security, we can do one of a few things:

1. We can put the intermediary's software code inside SGX, preventing the intermediary's secret key from being used to do anything but compute the result and the proof (thereby preventing vote selling) as long as EITHER (i) the intermediary is honest OR (ii) the SGX works
2. We can use [multi-party computation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/) to turn the intermediary into an M-of-N system, so you can choose eg. 10 participants where 5 of them would need to collude to stall the election or run a vote selling marketplace

[MACI](https://github.com/appliedzkp/maci) is an implementation of the above (though without MPC) and is being used for quadratic funding via [CLRfund](http://clrfund.eth.link/) already. There is also a 20-year-long academic discipline trying to create electronic voting systems, and it has settled on [solutions with very similar properties](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165.pdf), except with the MPC already baked in as part of the protocol.

Now, we get to the question that the academic cryptographer might ask: what's the point of using a blockchain instead of just using one of these academic schemes. To answer this, we should first compare and contrast the blockchain-based approach and these traditional approaches. To achieve correctness while preserving privacy, the schemes are similar; the only difference is that the traditional approaches use special-purpose proofs whereas MACI uses ZK-SNARKs. To preserve privacy itself, all the schemes rely on some form of encryption, where a decryption key is secret-shared between N participants. To achieve coercion resistance, basically all the schemes rely on some ability to give third parties invalid keys that they cannot tell are invalid. **But to achieve censorship resistance, the two schemes are different**: traditional schemes piggyback on the same N participants that hold the secret key, whereas blockchain based schemes use a different N - the entire community maintaining the blockchain.

We should note also that while the _current_ version of MACI has the property that the intermediary (or the M-of-N if it's upgraded to a decentralized intermediary) can break privacy, future versions can be designed with more layers of ZK tech to allow a stronger zero-knowledge property, where the intermediary cannot even break privacy; they can only break coercion resistance.

To summarize:

* Traditional schemes: small N (like a permissioned blockchain) for coercion resistance AND for censorship resistance
* Blockchain based schemes: small N for coercion resistance, large N for censorship resistance

Clearly, the second is better than the first. If you are someone in a more traditional academic background, this may not come naturally, however, as you might be used to maximizing the number of things that need to break to _any failure to happen at all_; the idea that 5 units of protection against X and 20 units of protection against Y is better than 5 units of protection against both X and Y is imo systematically undervalued (you can see this bias in consensus algorithm literature all the time).

In particular, a failure of coercion resistance is less bad than a failure in censorship resistance. If some people's votes get suppressed, and they have no way to prove it, this is utterly terrible for a voting system. But if the intermediaries collude and run a vote selling marketplace, then if they do it at scale, this will be publicly known and the vote could be stopped and the intermediaries replaced. So having a small N (smaller cost but less security) for coercion resistance and a large N (higher cost but more security) for censorship resistance is actually optimal! And this is exactly what blockchain based voting provides.

Finally, the caveats:

1. Blockchains need to be scalable for this to be possible. Eth2 sharding (even data sharding alone) is sufficient; its data layer would be able to process all votes for an election with 100M voters in less than 1 day.
2. ZK-SNARK tech needs to improve.
3. The teams that are technically competent enough to understand the above, and the usual teams shilling ""yay blockchain voting!!!1!"" are not the same
4. I strongly oppose doing any of the above at scale until it's very well-tested in smaller contexts (local elections and non-governmental things, eg. quadratic funding in the ethereum community and maybe decentralized social media systems, go first)
5. This all requires average users to have secure computing environments. We as a crypto community should work hard toward this.

This could usher in the normies in the US once the regulation has past...  You have to understand Americans are slow and fearful of pretty much everything.  I know, I live among them.  That aside, once they accept these new regulations the US will become quite friendly with crypto and dealing with personal wallets.  Then FOMO will happen and price would rise even further. 

As for the stable coin.  We'll Brian Brooks released it at Coinbase in Sep. 2020 or was it 2019?  Anyway USDC want to be more legitimate than the Federal Reserve as USDC is audited.  Audited just means it has value and integrity which in turn gives value to the product.

1. When you sign a transaction, you identify both your adress and the address you intend to send to as well as the exact amount you intend to send. You send this information with a unique signature that essentially cant be replicated without your private key. If you send this transaction out to fake nodes, the worst that happens if your transaction is never broadcast to the network. If the node tries to change your transaction without your private key, the signature wont match and the transaction would not be valid

2. If you are setting up an account and get your wallet from a bad source, you could potentially jepordize your funds. This is why you need to be very careful with how you set up an account to ensure only you know the keys

3. The most likely to succeed attack I can think of is if you owed someone $200 and wanted to pay in Ethereum, a third party could repkrt to you that 1 Eth is only worth $100, so you sign a transaction to send 2 eth as payment. Meanwhile, you just sent a payment for $1200.

Unless you are talking about sybil attacks on voting-style contracts where you would need to verify in some way that the vote is unique. Either account verification (could be done with tokens distrubuted when you confirm an email), or have the user stake something finite/costly for each vote (similar to how eth2 is set up)",,

I agree there is a need for better, user friendly interfaces to make sure people don't send funds to wallets to which they didn't intend to send (or even a wrong amount). But I'm not sure how asking for people to answer a question would help.

If anything, your wallet client should be able to let you configure a whitelist of addresses you like, with names associated to it and a maximum amount per unit of time you allow yourself to send globally (or even specifically tied to a given address, or even simply making the whitelist a simple list of references rather than forbidding the use of other addresses). 

You could even have a time you define before which any added address can't be used to send. All optionally set through toggles. And requiring your passphrase / password for any change. And if you have set a timer before any new address is usable.

With all this, I guess cryptocurrency uses would be way easier to non-tech people and increase security against human mistakes.",,

A hack that large that early on in Ethereums life could have derailed the project.

This is a huge problem! If you suggest that owning the token might give you a share of future profits, then it is a security and thus subject to securities regulation. I strongly advise against starting out like this.
Also, token holders expecting profits or even just ""number go up"" are some of the most burdensome people you will ever encounter on your message boards and chat channels. Stay away as long as you can.


I think that formality is such a cool project, you could probably get quite a lot of funding from donations - gitcoin style, or grants. Or maybe even standard crowdfunding where the fundraising goal is ""hiring one extra dev"" and the rewards are simply thank-you NFTs that may **or may not** be useful in the future.

**I think formality first and foremost needs a little publicity to (re)introduce it to the community.**

How would this work with a currency?,"Ethereum isn't just a cryptocurrency. It's an entire decentralised computer network that anyone can (pay to) use. If you're only interested in the currency aspect, check out the original open-source peer-to-peer currency, Bitcoin. Ethereum is much more powerful that Bitcoin. You can write computer programs that run on Ethereum, program autonomous banks and lotteries, and even create your own cryptocurrency on top of Ethereum. Ether, the currency of Ethereum, is just the fuel that makes the network run. You might even say it's... gas.","Yes, Ethereum is fully open source. Hundreds of highly skilled engineers are working on it, spread all over the globe.

You will find plenty of discussions (on here) and websites explaining the idea and vision of Ethereum. However, in short, most decentralized blockchains have their own currencies in order to pay fees for using (send/receive transactions) the network (aka the blockchain). The ones operating the decentralized nodes of this network are being compensated resp paid out with these fees (in currency of blockchain). At the beginning fees are rather high, because traffic is low. Over time , fees will lower, due to adaption and high traffic.

Also make sure that you understand the difference between Proof-of-work (PoW) network like Bitcoin and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) like Etheruem 2.0. This is basically the crucial point about decentralization of blockchains.

The following points try to simplify/abstract:

- A cryptocurrency has its own blockchain to store all the transactions that occurred.
- A proof of work/stake algorithm are different methods (or algorithms) to achieve consensus on which block will be added next to the blockchain
- [Proof of work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work)(PoW) requires proof that work of some kind occurred. In the case of Bitcoin miners are required to do this work before any of their blocks is accepted by others.
- [Proof of stake](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Stake) (PoS) requires users that have a high stake at the currency (i.e. hold a lot of coins) to determine the next block. This has a high risk of some party achieving monopoly of the currency but there are several methods to prevent that (by allocating random stakeholders to agree on a new block, and others).",The reasons you’d use an opensource decentralised currency are that you’re not a fan of modern monetary theory and that you don’t want any entity having controls of your funds who can ban you from their platform if they feel like it

On the other hand, if the queue is very long, BETH may also reflect the rewards until a deposit made now starts validating.

It is strange that they give BETH at 1:1. To make this fair, the actual ratio needs to adjust for the amount of rewards already collected prior to the buy. For example if you joined with 10 ETH on day 1, and your ETH already accumulated 1 ETH by the time I joined, it's not fair to give me 10 BETH for my 10 ETH, as your 10 BETH is already worth 11 ETH.

12/22/2020,ki8jai,3,/r/ethereum/comments/ki8jai/noob_developer_question_regarding_the_logic_of/,1,ethereum,Noob Developer Question Regarding the Logic of Dapps &amp; Smart Contracts.,"A few questions for you:

 * If I understand you correctly, you want only yourself to be able to add or remove people from this on-blockchain register?

 * What is a 'person' to you? A name? An email address? An Ethereum address?

Blockchain and DApps solve the problem of having many people modifying some shared state trustlessly, but according to rules. If the only person modifying the list is you, you don't really need  blockchain at all, just a centralized database that only you have control of. The only reason in this case I can think of to use blockchain would be to prove that you added or removed a certain person at a certain time, but the state of the register at any given time would be completely under your control, and hence centralized.

That having been said, you could easily implement it in a smart contract. It's trivial to [create a smart contract function](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/62978/how-to-restrict-access-to-a-function-to-the-owner-of-the-contract-only) that can only be called by the same Eth address that created the contract, or by any other arbitrary address(es). And again, you'll need to decide what a 'person' is in your system. An Eth address would be easiest, but mapping those to real people is an extremely challenging problem.

A much cooler question would be, ""How can I allow multiple people to change the state of the register?"" Imagine you could assign permissions to people to add/remove folks from the list, or allow anyone to add their name to a 'pending' queue of registrants and then all you, as the 'owner', have to do is approve them? Or what if the earliest registrants eventually automatically gained the power to approve new ones? There are all sorts of more interesting setups one can imagine, which would actually start to make real use of Ethereum's smart contracts.

With Ethereum, it pays to try to think outside the old, centralized box, because you have all the power in the world at your fingertips to build something brand new under the sun.",,

Last years ETH evolved a lot while BTC didn't and the result is that ETH will become a better store of value, with POS it will become more secure, thanks to smart contracts it allows for more decentralization, with sharding it will be scalable and ETH is fast.

In the other side BTC is more robust but devs are very slow, prioritize features that the majority doesn't need, are extreme in their thinking and the BTC community became a kind of dictatorship where any critic is rejected and banned and where speculation is king. BTC was meant to be a electronic cash system but you cannot use it given that a transaction is taking 1 hour if your lucky. 

When people hear about crypto they hear first about Bitcoin so my opinion is that Bitcoin will stay king for several more years, especially when the first will of people is generally to speculate and not decentralize.
In the same time ETH is younger and probably has more upside room to grow, it is also cheaper per coin.

If you have at least 32ETH and you are OK to stake it for at least a year, probably more, until Ethereum reach their next phase, you can use this guide to learn how to do it.

* exploitation of a smart contract on a decentralized service
* centralized failure on centralized services such as pools
* underlying assets crashing

Potential upsides:

* permissionless entry / exit where it applies
* realtime interest payouts
* possibly unusually high yields due to being an early adopter

At the end of the day, the point of these decentralized systems is that the trust resides in the code. But, if the code fails, you're kinda screwed. The more abstraction layers there are, the more points of failure there are. An unsavvy investor might not be able to assess those risks, perhaps due to lack of technical understanding of the system they are trusting.",Been wondering about that for a while too,"I normally try to explain this in the context of what people are already familiar with. Peer-to-peer lending cuts out the middleman (the bank in this case) in the same way that other aspects of the peer-to-peer economy work (AirBNB, Getaround, etc.).

Now, think about what the bank is taking as a fee for acting as the middle man. When you lend the bank money in a savings account, they offer you some insultingly low interest rate like 0.01%. But... when you borrow money from the bank interest rates are at least 2-3% in the case of a mortgage, but more like 5-10% for a car loan, and 20% or higher for credit cards! If we cut out the middle man, we can give the profits to the people actually doing the borrowing/lending."

I do believe there is a major asymmetry between individuals and governments. Individuals have rights, governments do not. This one observation leads us to a paradoxical situation where there are many things true of individuals which are untrue of the collective. However, that does not mean that nations do not exist, or that they are completely illegitimate. That conclusion does not follow.

Crypto is not a tech which will somehow save the world. Right now we have iPhones manufactured with slave labor paid $7 per month (not an exaggeration) and a hyper-toxic political climate caused by mass-scale political corruption. Crypto may be able to make things better, but it can't change the fundamental nature of humanity. Human beings have the potential to be both smart and evil. Any system crafted by a human can be broken by another human for fun and for profit, and that includes crypto.

I do think we're at the cusp of a major paradigm shift and that Crypto will play a part in that, but I also don't expect this to be an easy transition. The world's old sociopoliticla paradigm made a lot of people *very wealthy* and you best believe they won't give that up without trying to fight back. (In fact, I think that's part of the reason our politics here in the states has turned so sour.)",Tldr?,"We are experiencing a major paradigm shift for sure. Whether it's on the scale of the industrial revolution, cognitive revolution (invention of abstract thought), or just the early 70s (which was crazier than most realize, and weirdly similar ways), history will have to judge. 

I think the biggest shift is that consensus reality is becoming primarily defined by dopamine loops on social media. And the fundamental axioms there are very different than what most imagine today, e.g. political science."

I got confused by the decompiler output. Good job u/vicnaum. I'll keep the original posts because I think they show an interesting engineering details.

\---

So... This only looks like a tool to create ERC-20 Tokens. But I did some digging.

TL;DR: This tool creates a smart contract that is definitely not an ERC-20 Token. The output contract is now harmless but may be malicious in the future.

\---

If anyone submits the form, they send you 0.05 ETH and call your function createERC20(). So far so good.

Transaction calling the function: [0x5bcc2b0334459d5758c253bafabe6a8bd2930dbc1b84c9880a00a89841c5967f](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5bcc2b0334459d5758c253bafabe6a8bd2930dbc1b84c9880a00a89841c5967f)

But. This method createERC20() **DOES NOT** actually create an ERC20 token. It creates a different smart contract.

Example: [0xa81043fd06d57d140f6ad8c2913dbe87fdecdd5f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa81043fd06d57d140f6ad8c2913dbe87fdecdd5f) (you can look it up as an internal tx from the first posted)

Any developer who has some experience with Ethereum will tell you that the newly-created contract binary looks too short to be an ERC-20 token:

`0x363d3d373d3d3d363d6f10fd301be3200e67978e3cc67c962f485af43d82803e903d91602757fd5bf3`

Finally, if anyone interacts with the newly-created contract, it redirects all calls to address [0x10fd301be3200e67978e3cc67c962f48](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10fd301be3200e67978e3cc67c962f48). Currently it doesn't contain any smart contract so the transaction will revert. But it's possible the the address was pre-calculated and there is going to be a smart contract later that might do anything with the sent funds - including stealing them.","Sorry, bit of a noob here: I don't exactly understand what this does - would using this be mining or somehow otherwise allow me to collect ETH?","\>> How do you achieve such low transaction fees?

Yearn is ok ish, but I find it has lower yields on average and is more complicated for noobies.

Note both Year and Harvest (and pickle and everyone else) have had strategies hacked before. So balance how much you put in with a mind to risk/rewards. You don't get 100% APYs for nothing...

If pure yield isn't your thing, then both a Uniswap pool or Balancer pool are good strategies. I'd say they have near zero smart-contract hack risks, but you expose yourself to price swings. But if you have a long time horizon, passive fees from a pool do compound over time and could be huge if/when ETH hits $10K in a few months or later this decade.

The critical strategy for AMM pools is to pick similarly volatile, but correlated assets.

For example DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) paired with ETH in a Uniswap or Balancer Pool. Pair the UNI token with the BAL token. Or UNI with ETH. Or ETH with wBTC.

For lower risk/reward and lower volatility (but still nice yields) you can pair ETH with USDC, but everyone will scrram at you about ""impermanent loss""... which is a bit of a silly concept IMHO. If you want exposure and not too much through a full bull-bear-bull cycle, impermanent loss is a non-issue (so 5 to 10 year time horizon). If you are only around for 6 months and gonna dump... then don't both yield farming anything. Just hold ETH and dump it at a higher price than you buy it at.",I am looking to hear about this also.

In short, yes you can stake on that hardware, and you would need 32 ETH if you want to run your own node, short of that you'd have to join a staking pool just as PoW advocates without dedicated rigs join mining pools. 

If you are generally familiar with crypto best practices surrounding security you should be fine along that axis, and I'd say your risks are more protocol and economic related, and fairly low imo long-term. Again, r/ethstaker can provide some color to this.","Can I run a validator on a Mac? Is it easy out of the box or must I tinker a lot with terminal and stuff? I was going to try it on a mac, but most of the walkthroughs that I found are for Ubuntu.   With that being said I feel I did have to tinker with it a lot.  I got stuck a couple of times, but there is some good help on discord.   You should first run the validator on testnet.  You would use GETH instead of eth.   the walkthrough will show you how to get the amount of GETH you need to test.  I would consider myself a beginner in this and was able to get the testnet setup, but then I ran into an issue and honestly did feel I was ready to do it with real eth. 

Must I have 32 ETH on it to make it work? Yes, if you will be running your own.   You can use a pool if less than 32, like rocketpool (not sure if they are setup yet) and I believe Kraken is already allowing ETH staking.   Coinbase to come in first quarter of these year. 

Security-wise is it actually safe, would I be constantly under the focus of hackers?  The walkthroughs that I followed setup some basic security measures to the computer. 

The walkthrough I followed is from Somer Esat he has many walkthroughs and some of the most detailed instructions.

I personally use a Ledger Nano X (and S) and have been for a couple of years. I really love it ! Plus Metamask can do the interface, so you can use dApp like Uniswap etc without losing the security of Ledger. 10/10 !

Regarding storing the 24 words, one could use this tool : [https://bs.parity.io/#/](https://bs.parity.io/#/)

Basically you create 5 QR Code, and you only need 3 of them to recover you 24 words (this is in general, you could create N QR codes and you would need N / 2 + 1 to recover). You could dispatch those QR codes with different members of your family, making it so that even if your house burns, you could still recover your words (and btw even if you die, your family could probably recover it too, which is nice to have \^\^)","Depends if your going to spend the time to figure hardware wallets and crypto out and if your okay with the risk of sending crypto to the wrong address.

I have a Ledger, I use it for long term storage. I also have a metamask wallet for transacting and so I dont have to hook up my Ledger whenever I want to work with the crypto world.

Also you might want to find a reliable interest service so you can capture some of those 6% APY on ETH and 10% APY on USD deposits for some of your holdings if you havent already.","If you're starting out Torus ([https://app.tor.us](https://app.tor.us)) would be the easiest way to create your blockchain wallet.

I created these NFTs as digital gifts for patrons who participate in a drawing I am holding to win an original art piece. Creating a digital asset seemed like a fun and creative way to further engage with my supporters, whilst also speaking to the times we’re in with blockchain technology. I am more or less a lay person when it comes to all of this, but I do know we’re going to continue to see NFT/digital assets proliferate not only the current crypto communities but also industries at large. 

I wrote an article, [here](https://app.voice.com/post/@stacy/how-i-turned-my-artwork-into-nfts-1612053988-50948770), where I discuss using my NFTs as gifts, and as ways of further engaging with my patrons—and, potentially even other communities in the future. I did throw a few up in a marketplace to experiment, but giving gifts to my supporters is the objective of my project. I plan to include them in future projects as well. 

The buying and selling are only a couple aspects of NFTs.  They can be used in games, as collectables, for trading, artwork, community building/DACs, to vote, as engagement incentives, rewards, and the list goes on.

Right now, we appear to be in a bit of the Wild Wild West with NFTs. Many, such as myself, are curious and want to play around. I also saw what I thought was a fun opportunity to spread the energy of pro blockchain architecture and engagement. I’m also a content creator on Voice, one of the social media platforms running on a blockchain (in this case, EOSIO). 

I think all of this is the future being created now, and it’s exciting and full of possibility/potential. I look forward to learning a lot more about all of this, perhaps from some of you!"

Are you willing to automate that process? Or alternatively, are you willing for your payment history to be easily seen? 

2) How will you present the address to your customer? Do you need to generate a QR code. 

3) How will you match a specific order with a specific payment? Does that need to be automated? How many transactions do you expect to do?

4) How will you process refunds, overpayment, and underpayments? Are you willing to pay the transaction fees when those occur? 

5) How will you keep track of _both_ revenue AND gains on the crypto for accounting and tax purposes? Will you sell immediately? Will any gains belong to the company?

6) Do you expect you'll actually have customers who will pay in ETH? Do you want to accept stablecoins (e.g. Dai, USDC) as well? What about BTC?

You are absolutely right to point out that using a service to accept crypto is missing the point to a degree. Crypto DOES allow you to be your own bank and payment processor, but that doesn't mean it is convenient. If you can solve the above problems for yourself (perhaps with the assistance of a developer?), then you can do it. If not, then using a service may be worth it.",commenting to come back later

This allows users to read precisely what they're signing even when their computer or phone have been compromised.

If you can't read what you're signing, there's no point in using a hardware wallet with Ethereum.

Legacy hardware wallets were designed with a focus on Bitcoin and basic value transfer where there was little to verify beyond the recipient's address. But if you YOLO sign a complex transaction on Ethereum without verifying that the data does exactly what you intend it to, you gain no additional benefit - it's just security theater.

Our driving focus is to make the Lattice1 the hardware security standard for Ethereum, and we believe human-readable transactions displayed from the secure computing environment are among the key differentiators that emerged from our Ethereum-centric focus.

As the post states, this is just the first implementation of ABI parsing on the Lattice1 - there's a lot more work to do. Right now users must manually enter contract addresses to preload ABIs. There's a lot of friction in this approach and we are looking to automate it as well as eventually pull ABIs from a decentralized repository like [Sourcify](https://twitter.com/sourcifyeth). Another short term option is allowing users easily load packs of ABIs grouped by topic like top DEXes or top DeFi protocols.

In the meantime, we plan to pre-load the ABIs for all the dapps that have implemented direct Lattice1 pairing and signing in the next firmware update. If you've already added support please reach out to us and we'll include your dapp or service on our new user setup page and include your ABIs.

If you're a developer you can use these libraries to easily add support for the Lattice1 and other wallets:

* [Blocknative Onboard](https://www.blocknative.com/onboard)
* [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react)
* [sushi-web3-react](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushi-web3-react)

People think that there is 21 million BTC. That is wrong. There are 18.6 MM BTC nowadays and it will increase up to 21 MM in the future. It will continue to be a slightly inflationary coin.

ETH2.0 next phases will include EIP-1559 as an heritage from ETH1.0.","Define ‘scarcity’. 

Will ether have fewer coins than Bitcoin? No. Is that important? No. Will ether be more scarce than Bitcoin? Yes. Is that important? Yes.

Scarcity simply means short supply. Therefore if demand exceeds issuance, something can be scarce. 

Demand for Ethereum will increase and issuance will also decrease. This makes ETH scarce.

On the supply side, issuance is currently higher than Bitcoin, however this will change. Firstly with EIP-1559 and secondly with the transition to PoS - this means that issuance looks something like this - [https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png](https://docs.ethhub.io/assets/images/issuance_graph.png)

Throw in the fact that issuance can actually be negative when transaction fees are burned under EIP-1559 you get deflation and something that looks like this - [https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1352734923703123968?s=21](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1352734923703123968?s=21)

All this before you even start looking at demand. Ethereum  already has a network with more transactions ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/730838/number-of-daily-cryptocurrency-transactions-by-type/)), greater fees ([https://cryptofees.info](https://cryptofees.info)) and greater value movement ([https://money-movers.info](https://money-movers.info)). 

This is only going to increase in the future with adoption and dapp development.

ETH is scarce.","It’s projected to be deflationary. More scarce. Basic how it’s used. Bitcoin and ETH current have the same issuance, roughly 4%.

Bitcoin has a cap, but it won’t reach it until we’re all dead. We also have no idea of a cap will make it secure. Some think it won’t.

Ethereum has no hard cap, but issuance is small, irrelevant compared to daily swings. Also, it gets burned and deposited by far more ways than Bitcoin is even able to. As a result, it’s projected to be deflationary."

Here's an infographic that explains what is actually happening with a TX behind the scenes.,"This graphic explains the mechanics of adding transactions to a block, but doesn't really explain why the costs are high.

Basically there's a limited amount of transactions that can be added into a block because of fixed block sizes. When the network is 'congested' it means the pool of pending transactions is quite large and so users are outbidding themselves in terms of gas fees to be included in blocks faster, and other transactions stay in the pool longer.

Important sidenote: This is how the protocol works by design, not something miners have come up with, so congestion or high fees cannot be blamed on miners. It's just a limitation of eth until eth2 ships.","I'm posting this because a quick scroll of /r/ethereum shows like 15 different posts asking about gas price and this infographic has helped me explain the transaction process many times.

The short of it is that as adoption increases (or if some really hype project comes out and everyone tries to use it at once), the number of users sending transactions increases. The # of transactions that miners can confirm at a time is limited, so they prioritize the transactions with higher gas prices. This builds and builds and gas goes higher and higher.

Another factor is psychological. If your TX costs $5 in gas when ETH is $500, that same TX costs $15 in gas when ETH is $1500. The amount of ETH it requires is the same, but the value of that ETH goes up so it feels like it's way worse.

Layer 2 is on its way, thankfully, to help all of this.

I paid bid $93 in gas on a transaction and it's stuck in pending.  I have a loan that may get liquidated by volatility if I don't bite the bullet and drop $100+ on a single transaction.

As an investor I'm fucking pissed.  But as a software engineer I sympathize with the situation.  Every organization goes through scaling issues and growing pains.  Scaling to a global network of tens of millions of people is fucking hard even using traditional centralized server tech.

Imagine how difficult it is to scale up an experimental system based on theoretical computer science and math inventing totally new paradigms as you go with all your code out in the open for people to analyze for vulnerabilities.  Ethereum and smart contracts expose exponentially more attack surface then traditional web apps hidden in private networks behind firewalls and malicious attackers have enormous incentive to exploit any tiny vulnerability.

So building for blockchain is fucking hard, scary and you only get 1 chance to deploy to mainnet.  If most tech companies fuck up a deployment they can just roll it back.  Not so much with Blockchain.

Does this excuse development teams for not being prepared for scaling challenges?  No they must have to accept some of the blame.  Stop working on stupid fucking NFTs for a year and work on scaling solutions.

But Blockchain development is fucking difficult to get right and while I'm really pissed at the current situation, I'll begrudgingly choose security of the ecosystem over velocity if it really comes down to it.  But the need for scaling is URGENT.  The ETH Dev community should be LASER FOCUSED on scaling challenges instead of new features.  We need MORE developers in the space!  Try to learn to code if it's interesting to you there are lots of great resources.

I just try to look at the big fees I'm paying as the price of admission as an early adopter and I've made exponentially more in airdrops and earnings from DeFi then I've paid in fees.  So all things considered, I'm ahead.  Still sucks.  A lot.

The situation super sucks big time but we have to all contribute to the community however we can to move the ball forward.  Just my 2 gwei.

Because of its popularity, the network currently has to process too many operations, which increases the gas fees.

In addition to that, the ETH price is at an all time high, which is a multiplier of the dollar value of each transaction.

The problem with Ethereum (and most other networks) is that they have a single currency for everything. So if the price of the Coins go up, the price of the transaction goes up as well.

Refusing to upgrade to the new version of Ethereum that includes it? In that scenario there'll probably be a fork and the upgraded version will wind up with the majority of the value (since it seems to be what the *users* prefer). The miners that mine that version will make a fortune, the ones left behind on the old version lose a fortune, and eventually the hashpower rebalances out. I don't see this scenario as particularly concerning.

More concerning is if the miners upgrade to the new version and then try to play games with block sizes to ""nullify"" EIP-1559. In theory, they could do this. In practice it'll require a large cartel of self-interested miners to hold together and not betray each other for personal gain for a long period of time. I don't think that's particularly likely either, but if they do manage to pull that off then that just means the blockchain will behave similar to how it's behaving now.

That'll probably lead to an increased drive to PoS, since PoW miners are now actively subverting Ethereum's progress. Hopefully it won't cause PoS to get rolled out before it's fully tested and ready.","what's the point of 1559 except drama ? Hard fork risk.

Eth was never meant to be day traded.,"ETH2 won't solve all issues straight away, but yes, it will solve them

In my opinion, it's like when the new PS4 hardware appeared. They had 8 cores and all this wild stuff. In theory, games could run way better than on other hardware. But the issue was that the tech was so new that it took years for devs to figure out *how* to best use the system, and make quality productive apps

More specifically, eth2 takes the ideas that not every node in the network needs to store/verify all the data. We can split it up into network segments that each hold only a sliver of the total blockchain. Thus, we can achieve potentially infinite scalability, by adding more and more segments (""shards""). This is also btw what a big part of polkadot's design is... Rip off ethereum and try to do it sooner, pretty much

This, combined with layer2s, should allow for a truly decentralized network of networks, with a core ""truth engine"" in the middle that allows the shards to communicate

Ethereum computation is quite expensive, so it generally doesn't do insanely complex computation. Generally the bottleneck is reading from and writing to disk, so a mining or validating node usually needs an SSD drive not an HDD, and that drive is often quite busy.

The cost of each operation depends how much stress it typically puts on the computers doing the initial computation and subsequent verification, so for example adding two numbers together is very cheap, storing something temporarily in memory then reading it again is quite cheap, verifying a signature is a bit more expensive, and reading to disk is quite expensive. Occasionally we have a system upgrade and change some of these costs relative to each other.","The programming logic isn't necessarily complex. It's just a series of simple steps. For example:

1. Start with an input number
2. Add 10
3. If the result is greater than 15, multiply by 2
4. If the result is less than 15, multiply by 3 and add 10

Gas is charged per step, which is known as an ""operation"". In this example above, imagine we charged 5 gas per addition or multiplication. If the input was 7, the gas charged would be 10 (2 operations), but if the input was 3 the gas would be 15 (3 operations). In this way, we can specify the per-operation cost (5), but we can't say for certain how much the total gas will cost until we actually run through the steps with the real input and see. However, by looking at the code we can usually calculate the minimum and maximum possible cost at the quoted rate (10 or 15 for this example!).

Aside from different types of operations costing different amounts of gas, programs aren't really more or less complex, they are only longer or shorter. Ethereum miners take the programs submitted by users, calculate the results, and save them in the global ledger. To get your program processed quicker, you can offer to pay a higher per-operation price and outbid others (this is the gas price). Gas is paid in Ethereum (what you called coins).

The simplest program is a transfer of Ethereum from one account to another. This is what you are doing when you send Ethereum between two accounts.",

I understand Lyn’s views, however don’t necessarily agree with them myself.

It’s summed up nicely in in the 8-9:30 segment:

She states Ethereum has implementation risk. That much we know is true. But she’s vastly underestimating the reward aspect (she is “open about higher reward” of ETH) and her main reasoning is the Pfeffer argument (value doesn’t accrue as well on utility protocols), but rightfully so Raol slams this as outdated.

Raol then states that their asset allocations, and this is significant as it’s likely the stance of asset managers, follow three things:

- Liquidity preference 
- Time preference
- Risk preference 

Time preference will always be in Bitcoins favour, however as time goes on it becomes proportionally less significant. 

Liquidity preference is where I see a change, as with DeFi growing the way it is, ETH will become the preference. 

Risk preference is purely down to risk management and so this will vary. But because ETH is earlier in its network effects, **”the chances of more exponential price rises are higher”**. From an individual standpoint this becomes a no brainer, but I can understand why asset managers may feel different (and indeed Raol states that as the rewards are potentially greater, they only need a smaller allocation to have the same impact).

However my main conclusion is that once ETH 2.0 is implemented, there’s literally no more excuses for anyone and fundamentals will play out. 

Looking forward to the future!","i have read Lyn's article on Ethereum and she is spot on.

Hey man, I like your sentiment and the optimism but even for a mainstream coin like Ethereum this is still an extremely, extremely difficult space for a normal person. I think sometimes people don't realize how non tech-savvy people view the world. Many of them (rightfully) see the whole thing as a deathtrap full of scams and avoid it like the plague, and honestly that is the right attitude for a lot of people.

Even on this subreddit, there are shills and even the common Elon Musk scams lurking in many threads. The mods try to catch them as soon as possible, but they exist and you cannot truly stop them instantaneously unless you have a super advanced A.I. that can neutralize scam(ish) intent--and even then the scammers would simply evolve and adapt. Same with shills and so on.

I know more than one normal person who tried to get into this stuff but it's just so overwhelming if you are not tech savvy and willing to learn a LOT of things. Creating a wallet and keeping it safe is already a huge and difficult task for even many reasonable people. 

So what does an optimal side bar look like? Well the thing is it's already pretty good for what it is, but an all-in-one center of information is so difficult because the space is evolving every day. The highly intelligent tech savvy persistent person will go and read the bitcoin whitepaper until they GET IT, multiple times if necessary. Then the Ethereum white paper, then Vitalik's blog, then all the material on Ethereum, and so on. They will experiment with everything the space has to offer.

And I guess that's why it's so difficult to have ONE PLACE WITH ALL THE INFO--because the really good info is everywhere else on the Internet! And there's a ton of good stuff hidden in the depths of certain discord, IRC and other hidden communities.

...and so the side bar can be little more than a **""hey, welcome to Ethereum--here's some resources to get started and such, but you're gonna have to seek out things on your own and be willing to learn a lot.""**

I do hope for a future where this whole thing is easier, I truly do. But for now, we can show people the door to the temple of knowledge and they have to put in effort to learn.","I'm currently working on something like this.

2/17/2021,lm6cv7,2,/r/ethereum/comments/lm6cv7/new_to_crypto_and_a_lot_questions_about_ethereum/,1,ethereum,New to crypto and a lot questions about Ethereum,"Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert.

Ethereum the blockchain is simply a ledger or record that is safe and secure using cryptography. This security is provided by miners in Proof-of-Work Ethereum (1.0) and will be replaced by Stakers providing security in Proof-of-Stake Ethereum (2.0). Miners and Stakers are rewarded Ether for providing the security required to transact safely on the blockchain.

The basic functionality of securely recording transaction is being abstracted to create a ton of different types of Dapps (smart contracts).

There are two types of accounts on Ethereum: user accounts (also known as externally-owned accounts) and contracts. Dapps are accounts we can transact with that have code injected into them that execute whatever function they are meant to execute. The more complex the code execution the more expensive in terms of resources the Stakers and Miners need to provide it.

To answer your questions: 1. The benefit is securing and completing the transaction. And yes, they help secure and complete transactions. Dapps are just a type of account we transact with.

2. Ethereum is on a matrix of computers all connected to one another running the blockchain. Currently in Proof-of-Work the computers compete to mine the blocks. In ETH 2.0 the load is compartmentalized, so certain Shards (groups of computers) will be tasked with certain transactions.

3. There is a post listing the system requirements for running Staking Nodes on the Ethereum website. Since your computer will run a different type of consensus mechanism in 2.0, Proof-of-Stake rather than Proof-of-Work, the execution is different therefore your hardware will be working differently. And yes, if you are Staking or Mining your sole job is to secure and complete transaction done by Users to Dapps (i.e. smart contracts) as well as User to User, Smart Contract to Smart Contract, etc.

If anyone else can correct any mistake I made, feel free. Like I said, I'm not an expert.",,

Try doing ZK-Rollup validations on Bitcoin and you’ll find you can’t. 

Having a more complex base layer makes it possible for new, more advanced layer2 solutions to be developed without having to change the core protocol like you do on Bitcoin when you need new features.

Even with Layer2 networks, you still need to enable people to withdraw from a layer2 to layer1, so layer1 needs some support to represent those objects. Without the richness that Ethereum provides, you’d have constant hardforks anytime someone needed a new primitive in order to represent their layer2 asset, or you’d actually put hacks into the system to avoid hardforks. 

Having hard forks (which are planned releases) has no bearing on whether Ethereum is implemented well or is a poor foundation. If hardforks were constantly happening due to the need to fix bugs, I’d agree that the number of hardforks were a bad signal and were a symptom of a series of failures, but that’s not what’s happening on the network.","> I don't think there's a need to begin with to have such a complex smart contract infrastructure in the blockchain.

People who say this kind of thing about building systems on bitcoin have generally not tried to implement them. If you're prepared to have trusted parties like with Liquid then you can do a lot, if not then you can't - you can always sketch out a toy system that looks like it might work in theory, but it turns out to have impractical edge cases.

One of the sad things about bitcoin culture is the tendency to define all its bugs as features and create a religion around them, so bitcoin people all used to agree that trusted third-parties were security holes, but then when there was a rival system that could support stuff that bitcoin could only do with trusted third-parties they started to say, ""what's wrong with trusted third-parties"". I think this habit started out in a positive way where we had a weird new kind of system with interesting and unusual properties and we had to think of things it could be useful for, but it's got to a point where it's actively preventing you from solving problems, because you have to pretend they're not problems.",

Until then, it's another diversion like dogecoin for fools to stumble over.",If decentralization is a real benefit ( it is) then they can't compete in the long term.,"I haven't been that concerned with the rise of Binance.  In fact, this is probably the best thing that can happen to Ethereum.  You want people to play around on a pseudo decentralized chain like BSC while gas prices are so high.  Let them learn to use Metamask and learn to swap coins, etc.  It only expands the market.  Ultimately, BSC will fail if their goal is to replace Ethereum.  Only a fully decentralized chain can win long term.  Do you think Bitcoin would still be around today if there was a person (CZ) governments could subpoena?  Hardly...

My vision for the future is a solar system, with Ethereum 2.0 (L1) as the sun, and lots of different projects (planets) circulating around Ethereum's L1:  BSC, Polkadot, Cosmos, Ethereum L2's, Solana, etc.  

So how to play this?  Ethereum core devs should stay focused and continue to deliver according to plan.  That is our key success factor, God bless 'em.  Ethereum will win, if they, and the community, stay focused on 2.0.

Also, look at projects that connect all of this together, the ""gravity"" that holds the planets in orbit around the sun.  Projects like REN, RUNE, and others that help connect our multichain worlds together.  They will be key over the next 3-5 years.  Not just for BSC, but for all of the projects that come on line over 2021/22.  There will be a lot, and connectivity is key.

Also, to any Ethereum maximalists out there, please stop having breakdowns on Twitter and Reddit around BSC, it's embarrassing.  You are making things much worse by freaking out over this.  BSC is a gift, having a credible, properly decentralized chain suck away a lot of business would be much worse.  You are so lucky CZ is there to give people a playground until 2.0 is out.

1. People should be able to run arbitrarily long programs as long as they halt. The easiest way to do this is by letting the user set an upper limit
2. Execution costs miners (or later validators) time and energy. To avoid either a DoS with very long execution times or frequent rejection of long programs by miners out of Fear of DoS, paying for it makes sense.

It also incentivises programmers to keep programs short (reducing overall load).","These is a hard limit to what can be executed per block, that is the gas limit. The question then becomes how to divide this between all participants. Having a limit per transaction means a non-technical decision has to be made; how many transactions can be done per block? If the gas limit for transactions would be too high, it would disadvantage those who pay just as much for simple transactions. It's also possible to circumvent this limit by simply submitting multiple transactions.

Making the transactions priced per used gas gives nice economical pressure to optimize the gas used by transactions, and it allows the market to figure out how to best divide this scarce resource between market participants. (Although the gas market is not really efficient, but EIP1559 will help.)"

It's like creating a piece of art and then saying ""Look at this deed I made!""

The NFT contract is the rights to the piece of art, but not the art itself.

Right now, I buy a piece of comic art and sell it to you.  I don't kick that back to the artist. At all. They really have no right (in my view) to any money since it's not their property.  It's mine.  I am not sure I like the concept of buying something from you and kicking back 15% when I sell it.

I know that this kind of exists in the blockchain world, but what right does my contractor (for example) have to any portion of the proceeds on my house when I sell it? Even if I have Martha Stewart herself design my house, she doesn't get any money if she does it for free or did it for a million dollars.  It's my property. I paid them to do their craft and they go away and leave me alone. 

This fundamentally goes against my understanding of property rights IMO.  Also, I am a private person, so what right does anyone have to know what I paid for something or who I am?  At any rate... I don't like this, but I may be in the minority. 

People who turn their noses down at this should look at Beeple's art and others.

I know Marvel artists started doing this a few weeks ago publicly and their works are sold from about 2-4 ETH on [portion.io](https://portion.io) . Without much fanfare, the art sold very quickly as I understand it. However, it's paired with the actual physical art and we're dealing with (in my view) a very interesting way to launder money out of the blockchain, hah.  

Other than a store of value (like gold) and a source of income for an individual in perpetuity, I don't see the value in tokenized art. Moreover, I could in fact just dodge the whole thing and just send my friend the token and exchange for money outside the system, which dodges your royalty.  

I suppose it would show as a sale for a very absurdly low price and devalue the token to a degree, but maybe the publicity is the defense.  I don't know.  All I know is that I probably will buy something to see where it goes and have it in my portfolio, but it's not my preference.  

IMO artists who create an NFT of comic art are attempting to have their cake and eat it too by eschewing original art / pencils / inks and benefiting from this digital world."

There are several kinds of scalability solutions for Ethereum: State channels like Plasma, sidechains, or rollups.

State channels are only usable for simple transfers so they are of no use for scaling smart contracts. Sidechains are essentially a separate blockchain with their own set of validators; and mostly the number of validators is quite low which introduces centralization issues.

Enter optimistic rollups. They support the EVM which means they can scale smart contracts. Any existing dapp on Ethereum can literally copy/paste their code to Optimism with little changes and get going. Optimism can do anywhere from 500 - 2000 TPS, with super low fees. 

It's also secure and decentralized (if you want to get into the nitty gritty, read these two articles: https://research.paradigm.xyz/rollups, https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)

Now, why is this so huge? Because every single dapp on Ethereum can port over to Optimism starting in march. Users can deposit their funds with a single transaction and then enjoy the complete ecosystem of Ethereum with extremely low gas fees and high TPS, while being entirely noncustodial and decentralized.

Uniswap has already announced they will migrate there, and if Uniswap moves there, a significant part of Ethereum's ecosystem will move there.

Coinbase has also indicated support for Optimism, which means: You can withdraw your funds from Coinbase straight to Optimism without ever having to touch Layer 1 again. 

This effectively eliminates the high gas fee issue for Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization.

Farm 2 - ETHash selling to NiceHash - .03625 BTC

We are far exceeding what we thought.  We calculated about .06USD/MH but we have been getting .11USD/MH on average.  I know I shouldn't be calculating in USD, but I liken it to me not being able to think in Kilometers and resorting to Miles.

(The ""law"" could have bugs in it, but it's still immutable, deterministic, and objective.)

The best summary of Ethereum I've heard is that it's trying to be a World Computer. (Perhaps ""the"" World Computer, if it wins forever.) That's really the most interesting and exciting part about it.

Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are world ledgers, but maintaining a ledger is just one of tons of different things you could do with a computer. A world computer still has the same flaws as regular computers; it doesn't matter if you use a password if [someone can just hit you with a wrench until you divulge it](https://xkcd.com/538/). But it's still a very useful tool, and it'll probably have many future use cases which we can't predict right now.","If you would indulge me, I think the title and the body of your message are asking two different questions.

1. What problems is Ethereum trying to solve?
2. How will Ethereum impact the financial system?

There is some overlap between those two questions, but the answer to the first is much different than the answer to the second.

1. Ethereum _is not_ ""a decentralized financial system"". Ethereum is a decentralized virtual machine where anyone in the world can pay to issue one of (currently) 15 transactions per second to use some CPU cycles on this extremely slow computer.

2. This virtual machine, powered by a swarm of math and network packets, _may_ be used to try to build a ""decentralized financial system"" by building programs aka smart contracts to programmatically control things like changing number values in system memory (aka digital money). 

This virtual machine can be used to build any number of other things besides financial systems. You could try to build some sort of legal agreements, internet of things applications, election stuff, anything else where a bunch of different, possibly global parties need to coordinate and trust each other on a shared infrastructure with authentication and cryptography built in. 

Ethereum is shared public infrastructure that these applications can run on, that anyone can contribute to or participate in."

Data sharding will allow rollups to scale to 100k TPS and more. Rollup interoperability is *already* a thing with Connext, Hop protocol, etc.

If you make the mistake and compare Ethereum's Layer 2 to Bitcoin's Layer 2 (Liquid, Lightning Network) you are not plugged in to the space. Bitcoin's layer 2 has failed to see meaningful adoption because it's state-channel based, has an extremely clunky UI, and is just generally a mess.

Ethereum's layer 2 is literally a single tx to deposit your funds and you're in, enjoying your favorite dapps with super low fees and high TPS.

Just wait until the mainstream media find out about it...","This is what happens when everyone has to compete head to head. If someone simply wants to send Ether to a friend, they have to compete with the arbitrage bots, investors, gamblers and others whose business model involves outbidding everyone else.

Part of the problem is also one of the blockchain's most important benefits - transparency. Arbitrage and gambling bots don't have to guess what's going to happen in the next block because they already know, and use that to their advantage -- and our expense.

So now it costs $5 to $10 just to do anything. A $5 Cryptokitty would cost around $10 to $15 after fees. It costs a couple hundred dollars to deploy a small contract.

It's hard to blame the bot developers, when there really is no law or set of rules to govern this. .. at least none that I know of. As it stands now, the solution probably requires change at some level. It will be difficult to change the EVM, so maybe smart contract logic can address it.

On the other hand, maybe this will start a boom in mining. As miners compete the price will go down.

BNB is a fork of Ethereum but entirely run by a handful of high-spec Binance nodes, DOT has less than 250 nodes operating the network and similarly ADA has 1k nodes that can only be run by quasi-professional operators and uses DPoS (which incentivises cartels and bribery attacks).

As a former BTC maxi, I am sure you understand that decentralisation is key - ETH puts decentralisation at the core with a thriving development community that actually gets this stuff.","ETH is actually decentralized. All those “ETH killers” use DPoS instead of PoS or PoW. DPoS uses delegated pools controlled by a few hundred individual groups. And within those groups, just a few of them together basically hold the majority, so they can band together and reverse transactions if they feel like it etc. Just nonsense.

The carbon marketplace started with the Kyoto Protocol (1990's — 25ish years ago).

Before the Queen of Hearts gets you, I would suggest looking at both sides of the story (not just the marketing copy written by Uphold).

Here is a Reuters piece looking at the pros and cons.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-carbon-offsets-idUSKBN2AP1FZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-carbon-offsets-idUSKBN2AP1FZ)

Also, and not to be contrary, but carbon credits are not ""basically"" anything. They're super complex. The rules for generating the relatively straightforward REDD+ ones that the Uphold coin (currently) uses fill up a 330-page book. You can find it here (follow the links to download or browse the MGD 3.0).

[https://www.reddcompass.org/frontpage](https://www.reddcompass.org/frontpage)

You can boil it down though: The projects that generate these credits either reduce greenhouse gas emissions or prevent something that would have made greenhouse gas emissions.

Maybe buy a tree? It would probably be a more fruitful endeavor (depending on the species, of course).",Saving the planet through... taxation... so that the funds can be collected into the general fund and wasted like every other tax,

It's harder to implement and we already have a good record of Proof of Work, well, working. 

As far as I can see, there are no real downsides to Proof of Stake. The only argument that comes up repeatedly is that ""the rich get richer"". It's an absolutely true statement, but the same goes for Proof of Work - having a lot of money gives you the opportunity to buy more mining hardware. I'd say it's even worse for PoW since large amounts of money actually give you better access and prices to mining specific chips, whereas your 100th validator on PoS will cost just as much as your first.","While I currently see no downsides to PoS (higher security per locked capital, lower energy waste, lower issuance for equal security and more predictable block time), there are two main reasons why PoS (except delegated) has yet to be used.

1. Crypro could not have started with PoS. Once a system already has agreed value, it can be used. But to start a system from zero, value from outside needs to be used. Bitcoin did that brilliantly. He who is willing to spend most (in CPU time and electricity), gets the block reward (probabilistically). Now if you spent 0.05$ per BTC, you would value it at more than that. And we would all agree you got it fairly. But if the holder of most BTC would get more BTC, without a fair sale for a long period, no one would view it as fair, and the holder may not value his BTC as much. We had that long period with ETH. Everyone had a chance to buy and stake, so there is no question of fairness. The return rate is also known (and not very high compared to alternatives in this space), and determined by supply and demand, so we can agree it is fair.
2. It is hard to build. Other chains used delegated and other solutions, because this has never been build before, and some questions have never been answered before the beacon chain.","Proof of Work coins create real digital scarcity as you cannot have an infinite amount of PoW chains exist in parallel. Ones with very low market cap will be 51% attackable. With PoS you can create an infinite amount of chains.

PoS scarcity is basically relying on the network effect that the chain you're betting on has. If it switches you better be quick in exchanging your coins. But in a world with a hand full of PoW chains these chains could agree to stop all emerging competing chains and thereby limit the amount of existing PoW coins."

It's not as simple as just flipping a switch, there are a lot of things to consider.  The 2.0 software will have to be updated to take on the responsibilities currently being performed by the miners on 1.0.  Before that can happen, a spec has to be approved. Recently, a pull request for the initial spec was initiated.  That's the first step.  That will need to be reviewed, and some early code will need to be written to see if this makes sense. Security will need to be analyzed.  Then loop back and do it again.

3/14/2021,m50gig,20,/r/ethereum/comments/m50gig/ethereum_as_currency/,1,ethereum,Ethereum as currency.,"A bank check is closer to a transaction on the network than ether itself. It's a piece of paper that allows someone to transfer money from one account to another. The bank check itself holds no value. It's the currency in the bank account that has value.

Ether in the wallet is like the currency in the bank account. Except, ether is inherently smart, as it is connected to a protocol and database that is the blockchain it runs on, and is controlled by the logic of that protocol and database. Fiat currency, by itself, is not smart. It is the centralized systems that are built around it that control it. But because those centralized systems are not native to the currency, and are rarely built to talk to each other, there is a lot of inefficiency in the system. Whereas, with ether, the smart logic is built into the system already, and everything can be connected and just ""work"" with each other.

A real-world example: A company called Plaid, worth at least $5 billion (per the acquisition price Visa was going to pay for it), exists simply because bank logins can't natively connect to anything else (think financial planning app, cash payment app, other banks, etc). On Ethereum, all smart contracts and wallets can interact with each other, natively, out of the box.

That's just one facet of having a currency that is based on a decentralized network where computation is native to the system. You can add to that list things like cryptographic trust, transparent code, and decentralized organization, all of which increase trust and reduce friction and inefficiency in the financial system.

Do you see the value of Ethereum and ether?",Imagine if bank checks couldn't be faked because of the paper they were written on. Would that paper have any intrinsic value?,"Imagine Ethereum is like the internet which has a native currency, Ether. Ethereum is full of decentralized applications which you can think of like websites. These applications can vary from NFTS to casinos, market places and exchange, or even exotic financial instruments which can only be created on Ethereum. Whenever you interact with anything on Ethereum, you need to pay a transaction fee which can only be paid in Ether. By owning Ether, basically owning a share of Ethereum, or Ethereum processing power."

Bitcoin's next halving will be in three years. ETH is less than a year from fully migrating to proof of stake. Right now the proof-of-stake network only inflates at 0.3%. The exact amount depends on the total staked, but it's unlikely to go above 1%.

This July, EIP1559 will deploy and start burning most of ETH transaction fees. At current fee levels that's about $4 billion/year, maybe 3% of supply. So that alone may get net ETH inflation below BTC inflation.

After the PoS merge, with transaction fee burn and lower block rewards, net inflation is likely to go *negative*, which Bitcoin will never achieve even in the 22nd century, if it survives that long.",Just read about EIP 1559. The supply will get less inflationary very soon: [see here](https://decrypt.co/60395/upgrade-reduce-supply-ethereum-gets-launch-date-eip-1559),"> I understand that ethereum has an unlimited supply

I think you may understand wrong. As of right now, Ethereum has had a total of 115,237,542 Ether issued - a limited supply. Even more limited when you account for a large portion of that having been burned or staked or is otherwise inaccessible right now.

Perhaps you are thinking that it has an unlimited supply at infinity, some theoretical point in the far distant future. Well, in the long run the universe will be a dark and empty void bereft of usable energy as entropy reaches maximum. What is the plausible horizon of your investment or usage plans? Does it *matter* whether there's infinite Ether an infinite number of years from now? Ether's issuance is tailored around its utility *right now*. Its issuance rate is such that the value of Ether isn't currently being noticeably depressed by it, and the issuance rate isn't planned to be rising in the future.  The contrary."

- ETH 2.0 deployment schedule (“will it ever be released/ released on schedule?”)
- Gas and transaction prices post-2.0 (“will they actually drop/become cheaper?”)

Ultimately, if either question is proven negative at year’s end, 

- The biggest bag holders in the Ethereum ecosystem wi be unaffected since they can afford the status quo
- The first blockchain with smart contracts, dapps, and a **demonstrable ease-of-transition from the Ethereum network** will experience a sharp increase in migrating and new users. (No conjecture on what that might/should be.)
- Eventually Ethereum and Ether will be left to those who can afford it. If the group is small/specialized enough, Ethereum either begins to compete directly with Bitcoin as a store of value, or fades since new things are less frequently built on it.

also as I got it, first they need to do the merge which is planed after 1559 and only afterwards sharding goes(which will increase scaling)."

It would combine all of these solutions in a manner where they are not siloed and devs can move from one to the other when necessary. 

Not to mention, their SDK program is allowing devs the modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Imo, I think they're gonna come out ahead of the pack, as suggested by the crowds running to implement them, especially when they come out with optimism/zk roll ups.

Guess its an extra wei or two for transferring another digit, 1 ETH compared to 10 ETH. But over all its ""fixed"" and not based on amount.

However cashing out doesn't cost any gas at all, thats just coinbase fees. Think they are fixed as well. Fixed to eth though, if eth pumps a lot they might lower it.

4/13/2021,mqj5ym,9,/r/ethereum/comments/mqj5ym/ethereum_gas_limit/,1,ethereum,Ethereum gas limit,"That's a great question. The gas limit voting is one of the kind-of soggy bits of the Ethereum design where it's not entirely clear that it works in theory, but it seems to work pretty well in practice, and nobody knows exactly why. Generally miners seem to vote it up when people pester them about it, provided the core devs don't yell at them too much. ​It's probably some combination of goodwill and enlightened self-interest, combined with a lack of *strong* profit motive to do anything radical; Voting the limit up increases volume at the expense of price per unit, which probably doesn't *exactly* cancel out but largely does, so miners could probably squeeze out a little bit more revenue by tweaking the limit and seeing what happens, but not radically more.

EIP1559 changes this balance quite a lot because miners get paid tips per unit, but no longer benefit from congestion (except marginally as ETH holders) because that's eaten by the burn. I think it'll *probably* carry on working mostly the same but it's hard to say. This is one of the reasons I feel like the current plan to do EIP1559 under PoW but only for a few months seems like a really bad risk-reward trade-off; It'll mess with miners' incentives to manage the gas limit in ways that we can't predict, since we don't know why it works in the first place. Then before the risk can get paid off we move to PoS that has subtly different incentives, so we have to roll the dice again.","Gas limit is a protocol feature. You’d have to get half the miners or more to do a fork to change that. Plus gas limit isn’t arbitrary, it represents certain limits in EVM performance.","Something is worth what you're willing to pay. On days when the gas is 50, it's because nobody is willing to pay more.  On days when it's 200 it's because we're desperate to use it and will pay such a crazy price.

It's not artificial, we the users, as a collective set the gas price.

In normal times, I'm only going to pay a small amount of money for food. But in desperate times food & water could sell for 100x more because people are desperate. It's the free market at work."

1. What is your risk tolerance? If you're willing to absolutely gamble it, throw it into a memecoin, and you might just make some money (but also will very likely lose it all.) If you want a good chance of actually making good returns over a multi-year timeframe, just do BTC/ETH (but DO NOT SELL when crypto inevitably goes into a multi-year bear market). If you aren't willing to take any risk, crypto isn't for you.

2. What is your appetite for research? If you would rather not do any, then you're going to have to trust random people on the internet. This random person will tell you Eth is one of the best investments you can ever make, but so will everyone say about their pet coins, and you'll risk getting shilled a pump-and-dump or crap project that isn't going anywhere. The only way you can tell the difference is by doing your own reasearch. Then you'll *know* Eth is the best investment :)

3. Are you willing to keep investing as time goes on? $100 isn't going to get you too far no matter what you invest in, but you'll see the same gains, percentage-wise, as everyone else who's throwing in much more money. If you can contribute a little bit regularly (like every month), called dollar-cost-averaging, you will be following one of the most recommended practices to build your stack, and eventually you will have a sizable position.

Good luck!","At this point, ETH won’t make you rich by investing only $100 if this is what you’re looking for. But you might make 2, 3, 4x depending on how long you’re willing to hold. If you want a chance to make significant money, gamble in smaller coins, but know that might also go to $0."

The block chain is a long running ledger of transactions on a decentralized network. Transactions doesn't just include monetary ones. Ethereum is also Turing complete which means that it can be coded to run applications. Think of the whole Ethereum network as one giant virtual computer. ETH on the other hand is the crypto currency that runs on the network.

Crypto currencies are generated(minted) and distributed to miners who use computing power to validate the transactions on the chain by solving problems. This is called Proof-of-Work. Miners get new coins that then get circulated throughout the network to other people in the forms of payments, and the miners then validate those transactions by providing additional computing power and the cycle continues. Ethereum is actually moving away from proof of work to proof of stake which I admittedly don't know anything about.

Should you buy now / how long you should hold for are questions better left asking an analyst. But overall there's no way to really tell, since the market value of ethereum can either fluctuate up or down randomly. There's been speculation of a crashing when it goes to proof of stake or proof of stake generating a higher value. Ultimately the value is based on whatever people are willing to pay for it, and not linked to anything actually physical or any one entity stating that this is the exact price.

Edit: spelling/grammar","I'd recommend Coinbase/Coinbase Pro. Robinhood and PayPal won't let you transfer your crypto off their platform so your only option is to sell it if you want to move it somewhere else which means paying taxes.

Cryptowinters are what people have called the cyclical periods of reduced interest in crypto that have happened in the past. It's very similar to a bear market in stocks.

I'm holding on a long horizon 10+ years.

Ethereum is a blockchain. Ether(ETH) is the currency that you need to do things on that blockchain. It's value is a function of both speculation on future utility and utility right now.

Only you can make a decision about if you should buy. If you're investing for the long term then you don't really care about the price right now. If you're going to try and trade, then you need to DYOR and decide when you want to buy.","If you're in the States, I would recommend you check out Voyager app for trading. Solid app, really good for people just starting out and great coin offering. 

Second choice would be Coinbase Pro. A lot of people think this is some paid upgrade to Coinbase, but the reality is you have access to CB Pro with a standard Coinbase account and the trading fees are much lower. The CB Pro interface might be a little overwhelming for someone just starting out, but you'll get used to it."

The biggest problem is that people and markets will value things based on their own wants and needs regardless of how much labor it took to produce. The only way to specify that an object (or service) costs an amount directly proportional to how much labor is involved is sheer government force. That's why communism failed: the governments have to literally kill everyone who disagrees with the system or it falls apart.

So again, why do you think this is desirable? Should I be imprisoned or executed if I want to sell my goods at a lower rate than someone else who puts the same amount of labor into it?","That's not what labor theory of value says. Idk how you would ""implement"" it.

Not trying to be a dick or anything but maybe learn what it is from not biased sources.

Labor theory of value says labor + raw material = value. Value is split between the labor (wages) and the owner (profit). That's it. Now you can say that doesn't account for risk of entrepreneurship and whatnot but what y'all are talking about isn't even what LTV is.","Computers don't alter the laws of physics or economics.

If you are worried about transaction fees, they will be around two orders of magnitude lower on L2. Look into Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync 2.0 for a couple of these L2 rollups going live within months. Look to Loopring for an example of a live rollup.

There are plans to get fee's even lower than this on L2 with ""sharded data"" in the future.","I have my bags full of ETH and ADA and I wish people could accept the fact that they can both dominate the market together.

IMO they both have their advantages and both havent gotten to their full potential yet. ETH 2.0 will lower fees dramatically. ADA getting smart contracts will be a game changer.

ETH has a massive dev community. ADA is working on mass adoption of users in Africa. Both will do well together imo and shouldnt be viewed as 1 will fail as the other will succeed.

Just invest in both!","Well, gas fees depend on supply and demand. Ethereum is making significant investments in supply over the next 3-5 years (layer 2, sharding, etc.). If gas price are high even after all of this supply increase then demand must have significantly increased to match this supply. So, you can see by this logic .for Ethereum that IF gas fees are high THEN Ethereum is doing something pretty spectacular and there must not be any real competition."

No doubt many NFTs will go to zero and people will lose money, but I think many also will retain value as the space matures. 

NFTs as a whole shouldn't be tossed in the scam pile with Doge and the like. There is real value behind them, it's just that they are a new sort of thing that is widely misunderstood. Even within the context of art there are different use cases. I think you will see a lot more NFTs backed by physical works kept in cold storage within the art world proper, but the weirdest and most interesting thing is what's going on in the space you're concerned about. There, ownership of the artwork is not the point or the ultimate source of the value IMO. They function more as a sort of digital provenance that allows the owner to participate in the link between a creation and its creator. It's a new economic model that creates a market based on supporting artists more so than a new way to buy and sell art."

I really like the dYdX exchange which is currently running on StarkWare's rollup. Once you move your currency there you can trade very cheaply and almost instantly. The problem is that it is like an island, if you want to move to a different dApp or back to your wallet you have to rejoin the L1.

Polygon/Matic have a plasma chain with lots of things running on it (AAVE, Curve, QuickSwap, mStable etc), but the tradeoff there is one of security. Because you have moved to a plasma chain you're no longer getting the benefits of Ethereum's decentralized consensus. I'm pretty comfortable with this for playing with and learning to use DeFi applications, but I wouldn't put a majority of my assets onto their network. You have to weigh up your risk tolerance yourself.

With ETH 2.0 the blocksize may be able to be increased, as the load on nodes to process a larger size shouldn't be so severe as trying to do the same in a PoW system and therefore wouldn't threaten decentralization in the same way, however that isn't going to be some magic bullet that fixes network congestion and the associated high gas fees. The big change to the L1 that would fix this issue is sharding, whereby each node no longer has to validate the entire chain each blocktime. Data sharding might come after the 2,0 merge but that is not locked in.

Because of this it seems likely to me that L2 solutions will be here to stay, probably forever. Space on the L1 can become very expensive without really impacting everyday users if almost everything is done in rollups. Once Uniswap V3 moves to Optimism I really hope that we start to hear about bridges being developed to move between ZK rollups, Optimistic Rollups and Plasma chains. I'm still trying to understand how possible that really is, so don't take my speculation as a reliable prediction of the future...","""Layer 2"" Is a broad term encompassing any general system to batch transactions or perform computations off the main chain (primarily to save on operating costs as layer 1 block space is valuable), and then publish some proof of the work you did on the main chain with some dispute mechanism built in. The tradeoffs are simple, cheaper, easier scale, for either compartmentalized composability or liquidity fragmentation or different consensus entirely, it depends on the solution.

Eth might be the ""best"" option long term, but it's subject to the same wild swings of other crypto markets. And it's one major incident, or unforseen competitor away from a MAJOR crash.

Is the bottleneck with the amount of people mining or the physical limit of the Eth network? If it's the former then surely more people will just start mining as it's so much more profitable than any other algorithm for the average miner. If it's the later then that answers my questions and yours, no it can't change until the network upgrades. 

Anyone who knows more than me please correct me if I'm chatting shit 😂","Yes. ETH2.0 is actually a series of several improvements that will come out iteratively.

As much as I want to see Ethereum scale, I had more respect for the old approach... not because it made sense, but because it was honest, even if misguided. The new ""Ethereum 2 is just an upgrade"" is dishonest and I hate to see the tribalism taking over to the point of not wanting to face facts.

EOS was the first blockchain to embrace WebAssembly (from my understanding) and the entire Ethereum gang was seemingly mocking that approach. Now, 3 years later, Ethereum is playing catch-up to gen 3 blockchains and copying their approach.

[https://telos.net/evm-technical-update/](https://telos.net/evm-technical-update/)  <-- biggest competition imho.

Imagine you are a business owner/project manager/lead architect. Why put your entire blockchain project on hold for several years when you can simply deploy your existing solidity code on another blockchain? The theoretical EVM currently being promised by the Ethereum 2 devs isn't even impressive. Their roadmap is ""in x years we will be able to deliver an EVM that is more costly and less scalable than those that are already up and running on other blockchains"" ... it doesn't make sense. Sorry.

The Ethereum devs wasted years following a path that led nowhere... this should be readily apparent by now... 

I know I'll probably get down-voted for expressing myself in here, but that's proving my point for me.","Same thing that happens to most things on the Ethereum roadmap. It gets hyped up for a while, then people find flaws in it, or stop working on it or whatever, and it just quietly dies.

Like on-chain scaling. Or the first two (three?) forms of Casper. Or ASIC resistance. Or a predictable issuance schedule. Or account abstraction.

That's just what I can think of off the top of my head. I'm sure there are a bunch more I'm not remembering.

I'm not saying they get hyped for some sweet pump action, but they totally get hyped for some sweet pump action.",

Second, Polygon is just a more-centralized side-chain. It's basically BSC, except not hostile to the Ethereum community. Applications that need decentralization will always stick with Ethereum or Ethereum L2s over sidechains.","No polygon is here to stay. However, there is strong competition on it's why, so I think some of the hype will be short lived.

Polygon is not a true L2 network. Optimism and OMGX is, and thus more secure. Plus you have things like fast exits, that's coming, which are a big deal.","No. 

Polygon is a great addition to ethereum. There will be many like it. 

Ethereum will sink to the bottom of the stack settling between a multitude of L2s and other types of scaling solutions (which will likely become known just as plug-in ecosystems that use ethereum as their baselayer for truth of ownership and trust)

Ethereum is the internet of value. The protocol at the bottom upon which all else relies and that enables all others to exchange and settle value across solutions. Of course there will be protocols that allows cross L2 liquidity/transactions, but those should probably be considered as IOUs which a some stage will be settled through the ethereum baselayer. 

So imagine that South Africa has their rand running on polygon and Nintendo has their in game items on a polkadot parachain. Let’s say 10,000 South Africans buy Nintendo in game items every month, which during the months is just kept track of through exchanging notes through something like Qredo or Vector from Connext. Only at the end of the month are all payments settled from rand to USDC between the L2s, settling the IOUs using the ethereum mainchain. 

This is the scenario where ethereum is the internet of value and all else depends on it."

Uniswap is one that isn't. Uniswap v1 and v2 are both still running and you can use them if you want.","The concept of upgrading contracts after the fact is called ""Proxy Pattern"":
- https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns/
- https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-smart-contracts-upgradable-2612e771d5a2

Generally speaking there isn't much you can do about it as a user. The Ethereum Nodes will just run the code the contract provided. Doesn't really matter if it's upgrade code, or not. One way to stop this from happening would be a fork where one part of the network removes the new contract code, but that's usually highly unlikely.

Another way you could implement this is to come up with your own token and guard the logic such that the upgrade is only rolled-out when X tokens are e.g. staked somewhere.

But again, ""code is law"", so it depends on the implementation itself.

This means you don’t have to rely on any other nodes in the network or fully trust them.You won't have to leak your addresses and balances to random nodes. Everything can be checked with your own client.Your dapp can be more secure and private if you use your own node. Metamask, MyEtherWallet and some other wallets can be easily pointed to your own local node.

Any opinions on this?,"The entire existing financial system runs in the same heuristic approach - engineers don’t spend time doing academic proofs in the traditional world because we learn more by delivering working systems and seeing how they are actually used. 

Academic proofs also don’t provide guarantees that the implementation will be big free or handle unforeseen scenarios. A lot of what happens in the blockchain world is about aligning incentives, and a proof can easily be made without being aware of all possible incentives. 

I also wouldn’t classify heuristics as “trial and error”. Decisions are made and implemented based on existing experiences and knowledge, it’s not as if these changes aren’t thought through, discussed, tested, and monitored for correctness.","Trial and error is most web software comes about. 

Since software products have less mechanical overhead, rapid iteration allows companies to test core ideas quickly and pivot before committing too deeply to something that their core audience might reject. 

While not explicitly favoring one approach over the other, I will note that (in the context of the preceding,) Cardano’s chief danger is finding themselves defending their choices to an unconcerned market. 

Consider the following: 

> Excluding blockchain technology, think of every popular software that has influenced your life(web/mobile app; game, etc) from the last 10 years. 
> How many of those did you adopt because they had sound, scientific principles?","This is why Charles and vitalik split up to begin with.

Min specs IMO: i7 or equivalent CPU, 8GB, 1TB SSD  


I'd recommend something like the linked dapp node so that you have more overhead tho.",R/ethstaker,"While you can do with the bare specs mentioned, in practice a good modern computer with a reasonable SSD (2TB good, 4TB and you won't need to upgrade for several years) is better, not to worry about the additional overhead of producing full blocks, higher load at peaks post EIP1559 etc. For extra redundancy, you can have a double setup, both syncing but only one validating, but you \*must\* make sure that the backup doesn't start validating unless the original is down for >15 min. Otherwise you might get slashes (loss of money + kickout waiting for withdraws to be enabled). This is more that enough to stake hundreds of millions of dollars (maybe more).

The more important aspect is actually the software side. I'd strongly recommend linux, but win/mac are also available. You can setup one ETH1 client and use infura as backup (no worries here) and two ETH 2 clients (please don't use prysm as choice 1, it's great but we need client diversity, and the others are just as good). Same 15 min rule, the backup needs to be used only after the original stopped working, isn't going to re-start itself and 15 minutes have passed.

A few minor points:

1. You can start this today, the Beacon chain is live, no need to wait for the merge.
2. In a few months, you'll be able to run it for the rocketpool, using only 16 ETH per validator (the pool gives the other 16) keeping the profits on your share and collecting some additional fees.
3. The current APY is nice, but far from amazing (\~7% in ETH), may go up post merge with tips and MEV.
4. Staked ETH is locked, and may not be available for withdraw for a year, maybe even more."

When WETH was deployed to Ropsten it generated the `0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab` address. When it was deployed to Mainnet, it generated the `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` address.

So the addresses are chain dependant.

Side note: You might want to look into using hardhat with mainnet forking for development. When you start the hardhat server, you connect metamask to the hardhat network at `localhost:8545`, which, in that case, honors the current state of mainnet, but any changes are kept locally.

The spec isn't finalized yet and the amount of testing that will be needed across all the clients in the execution layer and the beacon chain to confidently work in harmony for this monumental shift is not insignificant. I'm happy if I'm proven wrong though.","How is eth being scarce good for everyone though? Sure seems like it’s best for those who already have eth.

The current process of mining is clearly not the way, but I am also super unclear of why everyone seems so happy with proof of stake which removes any technical or knowledge barriers and just makes it about who has the most capital to spend."

This is correct. Rollups are separate chains, but chains that inherit the security properties of Ethereum (unlike sidechains, which have their own security).

Being a separate chain means separate application deployments, separate liquidity pools, etc

> So if that project has an ERC20 token, that token will only exist on Optimism, correct?

Nope, you can easily build a reverse-bridge to move L2-native assets to L1 (and from there, in to other L2s)

> If you mint an NFT on Optimism can you bridge it anywhere else?

Yep, assuming a good bridge is built

> Is it gonna be as simple as switch Metamask from mainnet to Polygon? 

Yep!

I'd suggest trying out Optimism, you can already use Uniswap and Synthetix on it.

Using Optimism is pretty much the same experience as Polygon",,

Businesses, governments, digital organizations, they'll all use Ethereum for settling payments (just like Visa is doing today), issuing equities and other assets (just like the European Investment Bank is already doing), and virtual goods (just like Gamestop is doing today).

No low-value transactions will take place on Ethereum mainnet, the high costs will make it only affordable for large players. However, there's rich ecosystem of rollups attached to Ethereum for users to use. Some rollups are super low-cost, and are used for payments, others are specialized for trading, others are great for NFTs and gaming. Thankfully, there's a great series of bridges, and most users never know which rollup their assets are actually on, since moving from one to another only takes less than a second and costs less than a cent.","Celebrating the 5th anniversary of you asking this question.

\- Lower inflation immediately after the Merge, all the way till 2028. 

\- If we assume the blockchain industry will continue to grow, lower inflation than Bitcoin for the foreseeable future, with higher security. Over time, the difference in inflation may shrink, but the difference in security will favour Ethereum further. 

\- If we assume the industry has peaked and it's all downhill from here, Bitcoin will have lower inflation, but Ethereum will continue to be more secure at the cost of some inflation (still <1%). 

In all scenarios, Ethereum has the superior monetary policy. The only thing that remains is to prove itself over several years, as Bitcoin currently has that advantage of being ossified for over a decade.","Dependent on the Merge, but based on how the dev team handled EIP-1559, I’m feeling pretty optimistic.","Currently no, but yes if ETH 2.0 succeeds and ETH proves itself over 10+ years.

People are getting worried about how well Eth is doing.,they think they are buying a stock on robinhood. give them a break.,"What's wrong with the market (ETH holders) deciding on what the gas limit should be?

The same will be the case in PoS.

This is not an ""attack"" on Ethereum. An ""attack"" is something like the Shanghai dos attacks. In fact, this is just more inclusive governance. Why should only miners decide the gas limit and not the holders of ETH?

This is just economic actors engaging in voluntary payments to tell miners what they want the gas limit to be.

The ""scam"" is that the team behind it is keeping 20% of the tokens. So they'll force big ETH holders to buy it to bribe miners to keep the gas limit high and not set it to zero so there are no transactions.

If there was no ""profit motive token"" and there was a contract just paid in ETH, this would actually be beneficial to the community. The problem is that the founders of this gas token have 20% of the supply and can pay miners with leverage that wouldn't be available with an ETH only contract. Ultimately the miners will dump the token and convert it to ETH, so it will crash in price.

ETH miners will act rationally. They only have a few months left to mine and want to maximize their profits. Not understanding this or crying about it is like being upset that the sky is blue.

The ETH community just needs to think rationally. If they don't want the gas limit to drop, they simply need to pay miners to keep the gas limit unchanged or high."

The guarantee at Coinbase guarantees for hacks that leak customer funds.

Basically, they have said that it's the next upgrade to Ethereum, and it will '[probably happen earlier than expected.](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/)'. The talk at the water cooler is that it will come somewhere in Q1 of 2022, perhaps even earlier.

The merge is also known as a component of [Ethereum 2.0](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) where the current Proof of Work consensus algorithm is being upgraded to the Proof of Stake consensus algorithm.

The Proof of Stake algorithm has been running in the form of the [Beacon Chain](https://beaconcha.in/) without any major problems for the entirety of 2021 so far, so it's time to get rid of the environment unfriendly energy burning and replace it with something more sustainable.

As part of this, the issuance of Eth will be dramatically lowered. This, in combination with the already active fee-burning will make Ethereum [ultrasound money](https://ultrasound.money/). This will make it so that, in times when the network is active, more ethereum is being burned then created."

You can map a token if you mint it on eth Matic will map the same address to it on Matic. But there might be nft bridges or some way to transfer it. Also I think open sea does show Matic nfts in your collection even on mainnet 

So yea I’d prefer to buy nfts on Matic  since it’s a lot cheaper. But I’m also not an nft whale. I don’t know where your market is but side chain nfts may be a good niche. More whales on eth tho, gotta be a bit of a whale to handle the tx costs. Give it a shot, you loose less while you learn then take it to mainnet"

This value is subjective. 

The market price of ETH comes from the price discovery, on the market, between all the people who want to profit from these use cases and all the people who own ETH and consider other use cases to be more profitable (hence selling their ETH). Market pressure to sell or buy drives the price up or down, depending on market takers either buying or selling. More profitable use cases increase market buy pressure, while less increase market sale pressure due to opportunity costs (notably due to the fact there are other profitable use cases out there, outside of Ethereum). 

The burn reduces over time the circulating ETH supply, which builds up a reduced market sale pressure. This reduced market sale pressure compounds over time, as any burnt ETH is an ETH that isn't sold more than one time. The burn, coupled with the velocity of the currency, provides a ground for an effect on the price, increasing it over time. 

Now, to answer your question, based on this all, the burn is reduced by the L2 solutions, by solving partially or completely L1 congestion. This alleviates a bit of the reduction in market sale pressure. 

But, the reduced congestion also increases the number of profitable use cases for most people, notably anyone who's not extremely rich, which will drive the demand and, as such, the market buy pressure. 

All in all, I think better use cases is better. Keeping things as is would let Ethereum wither away, just as much as Bitcoin sadly is, with competitors bringing more and more of the adoption to the public. 

Even right now, we're observing L2s offering transactions of less than $0.5. As more people come to L2s and stop congesting the L1 with their transactions, this cost will go even lower. And we can expect even better fees with better data compression and optimizations of L2 solutions.",Layer 2s also need to post transactions to Ethereum L1

There are many types of ""users"". The kinds of users who would run nodes other than for mining/validating tend to be developers, service providers, researchers, and enthusiasts. More ""retail"" type users likely won't be running nodes, though this might change with the move towards stateless clients which could allow for very cheap nodes to run in your browser. Service providers to give some examples would be things like the people who run block explorers, wallets, dapp frontends, etc.

If the hardware requirements for a node were high, then some users would have no choice but to be at the mercy of centralized providers like infura. Instead, users have the option of running their own node either in the cloud or in a data center for relatively low cost.

It's fair to say that infura has a dominant position as a gateway into Ethereum right now. But the key thing is that because node requirements are low, they could disappear tomorrow and the ecosystem would keep chugging along since running your own node is not too onerous. If they turned malicious, they would likewise be quickly replaced by their competition. If instead, running your own node was highly specialized, centralized providers like infura would wield enough power to severely undermine the credible neutrality of the protocol.

Anyway, I understand that these design principles have made Ethereum a victim of own success in the near term with the way gas fees are right now. But it's important to reflect why people are paying those fees, because users (of all kinds, but especially builders and thought leaders) value decentralization and are in this for the long haul and we are finally at the first stages of Ethereum's long term scalability roadmap with an explosion of innovation in L2, the coming PoS merge, and the subsequent focus on data shards which will supercharge L2 to reach the necessary throughput for virtually any type of demand.",,

That will put Ethereum at a P/E ratio of 51. That's pretty good for high tech and really good when you look at the growth. For reference, Nvidia has a PE ratio of 79 and Amazon is 60.

I feel pretty good about Ethereum's valuation here. Obviously PE ratio is not the whole picture, hopefully other factors will drive ETH price even higher.

Maybe you can add a dropdown, or something alike, to the input field with different types of transactions/gas limits?

And, maybe it's a bit to much to ask at this point, but it would be perfect if it would be possible to directly compare to L2 transactions.",,
9/22/2021,ptl988,172,/r/ethereum/comments/ptl988/gas_fees_and_failed_nft_transactions/,4,ethereum,Gas fees and failed NFT transactions.,"Here is how it works. The network doesn't care what transaction you are making. The network performs transactions and makes computations for a fee per unit of computing.

The gas price is the amount you are willing to pay per computation unit and the gas limit is the maximum number of computations you are willing to pay for. This is calculated by you. The network doesn't care if your transaction fails. That is up to you and should be automatically calculated based on the transaction or smart contract you are trying to do.

When a transaction fails from running out of gas, what happens if you were willing to pay $0.01 per computation and the transaction needed 100 computations to complete. You wouldn't know it takes 100 computations to complete unless you check. The miners obviously won't (and shouldn't) do this for you, but your wallet should provide this service for you. It checks how much gas is expected and tells you. If you change that number to 99 instead of 100, you'll provide $0.99 to a miner and code for them to run. They will run it, get 99% complete and then run out of gas. The miner will not do work for you for free (and they shouldn't) and your transaction will return a transaction failed out of gas error.

Don't touch the gas limit. Adjusting it won't save you a single penny, but it could cause your transaction to fail. You could set the gas limit to 500 billion and it would cost the same as a limit that just barely has a high enough limit (assuming there isn't an infinite loop). Any excess gas after the transaction finishes is returned to you, but if even one computation is missed, the whole transaction fails. Do not change this from the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.

This is a feature, as you can only imagine the carnage that a partially-complete transaction could have. Imaging trading on a DEX and it only transfers your coins out and not the coin you traded for back.

If it is expensive, feel free to lower the gas fee per unit. It might take longer to go through, but at least you won't have a failed transaction.

For a better explanation on the two parts to gas see here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/p3u91m/The_future_of_finance/h8utlwu","It works like that because of a separation of concerns. It's mostly OpenSea's fault for not setting the gas limit high enough (unless you manually lowered it hoping to pay less fees, but I can't tell). The miners just execute the transactions as they come in without caring what the transaction is and if they reach the allowed limit the transaction fails. Otherwise you could just send a transaction that's a hidden infinite loop. And from there telling whether or not it'll stop is a [known impossible problem in Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and even with finite boundaries, it still scales exponentially and it's a lot of extra work for miners (for the whole network, really) that could be a potential attack vector for someone to slow the whole network down with bogus transactions.

Expecting a refund from the miners/network in this scenario is kina like expecting a refund from your car's manufacturer because the $20's worth of gasoline you bought only got you halfway. The car couldn't know that ahead of time, and the gasoline is just burned up and gone forever, you're not getting it back. Or I could push the anology further and have OpenSea be a bus driver that quotes you $20 and then leaves you stranded when the bus runs out of gas, but we're kinda past analogies now and I don't want this to derail like the postage analogy thread did below lol

> My question here is, is this just a growing pain thing? Or do the developers intend to keep this kind of system in place where customers lose their money ?

The answer to the first question is yes, it's a growing pain and user experience is severely lacking in the crypto space in general. But the answer to the second question is also yes, the developers intend to keep this gas-burned-limit-reached-no-refund system in place (but obviously they don't intend users to lose their money because of it, but it is an unfortunate side effect of not knowing what you're doing and higher level systems suggesting wrong values for gas price/limit)

The problem with DeFi/NFT's explosion in popularity is that it happened waaaay before the user experience had time to catch up. All these step-by-step guides of complicated tech jargon made it so people without any experience or tech knowledge would just follow them blindly and in some cases see this ""Gas limit"" option that, when lowered, makes the transaction fees cheaper. But of course if it's too low, you run out of gas and don't get a refund. But the average joe who just wants to buy some SafeMoon doesn't know that nor really cares to learn it.

Expect a lot of abstraction to come in the future that makes it better for the average person. Eventually there won't be any need for the user to know about all this gas crap going on under the hood, the same way now how your grandma is able to use Facebook today without having to understand how IP packets get routed under the hood. But 25 years ago she would have had to follow a complicated step-by-step guide filled with incomprehensible tech jargon just to get on IRC to talk to people. She'd quickly give up and say ""no one will ever use this, it's too complicated"". But the need is there, and the tech *will* get better over time to allow more people to use it. This why we're still early!","To make sure I understand correctly, you lost $229 on a transaction that did not complete, and the money is gone?

You can fork the network with a single node which would be like 0.001% consensus and people could still accept that chain as valid if they wanted.,"Wow, you brought some heated discussion from some very uninformed people.

Think of an upgrade like a baton pass. Miners lead up to the block of the PoS upgrade and validators take it from there. This is actually true of any upgrade. Normally the bottom is passed from PoW miners to PoW miners, but in this case the PoW miners can move on to other things after the upgrade. They are only responsible for getting to the block for the upgrade. Validators will take it from there.

Let's say Bitcoin decided to update to be ASIC resistant. (They wouldn't, but let's say they do). The ASIC miners would be responsible for getting to the block necessary for the upgrade and then the GPU miners would take over. Nothing else needed from the ASIC miners to proceed.

All that matters for the initial group is that they get to the upgrade block. They don't need to run some special code for the upgrade, just keep doing what they are doing. Then the validators pick it up from there and move forward as necessary. The second group is the group you need to be in sync with the upgrade.

The reason is because the entire community is in sync. If you and me and etherscan and metamask, etc, etc all decide that PoW blocks are Ethereum until block 13.5M and then PoS blocks are all that matters, then that's what will happen.

That is why consensus is law. If everyone (read: the super-majority) decides that the upgrade happens that way, then it does. Right now the community believes in the Ethereum foundation and the code they are creating, testing and releasing.

At any point, the community could decide against using their upgrades or use someone else's code. That doesn't seem likely in our current timeline, but could change if the Ethereum foundation stared acting outside of the community's best interest."

I've dug quite deep on Radix too and it's my absolute fav project after ETH.

What I don't think comes through enough in your post is the topic atomicity. Yes, handling a f*ckton of transactions per second will be important in the future when you want to run something like a social network on the blockchain.

But the fact that you can group a number of transactions into one and instantly execute it is what makes Radix amazing to me. 

1. It eliminates the ""risk"" of whales using their power to dominate through arbitrage (by using software to spot DeFi arbitrage opportunities that mortals wouldn't be able to afford). They would earn more money and power and hence be in the position to invest more in even better software. ♻️ 

2. It eliminates the risk of money getting stuck between contracts. Assume a DeFi transaction consists of 3 transactions that get executed subsequently. Transaction A and B get executed, but the price changed during the execution, so that the funds of the contract are not sufficient to execute transaction C. The money gets stuck.

#2 is what makes Radix perfect for DeFi.",

10/7/2021,q3q2x5,11,/r/ethereum/comments/q3q2x5/layer_1_vs_layer_2_loops_is_a_giant_paradox/,1,ethereum,Layer 1 vs layer 2 loops is a giant paradox.,"A layer 2 is not the same as a side chain. 

1.) Decentralization
 Eth strives to be as decentralized as possible. Making the hardware required to run a node super cheap and affordable. It also decentralizes the clients and dev teams so no one node client bug will break the chain.

2.) Economic security model.
This kinda dives into the PoW vs PoS arguments. Also with the burn and after the merge Eth will be deflationary. Things that are secured by Ethereum inherit the security that Ethereum provides whether that is the amount of TH/s or Eth ($) locked up with PoS. 

3.) Confirmation assurances
Kinda tags onto economic security but there are certain assurances you want/need to have when working with very large sums of value. If you transfer $150million worth of an asset you don't want that transfer to get stuck in limbo, or reverted because there was a fork and and your txn was on the wrong fork etc..


4.) Developers & network effects
There are a lot of smart devs and smart projects building on Eth. The more people on the network the more valuable it is and harder it is to switch away.


Layer 2's operate on top of ethereum. Layer 2 uses Eth for txn fees. A few weeks back Arbitrum's sequencer had some issue and went down, but since it is just a layer on Ethereum you could manually interact with the contract to access funds and do transfers. If a side chain gets attacked or has a bug there isn't the same level of assurances to migrate things back.

There are definitely reasons to use side chains and layer 2s and we will need them for the future. I think for most people in the future probably won't touch a layer 1 at all and it will be just the foundation layer that everything is built of off. But all those layers and rollups need to post their data somewhere secure.","Hold on.. You’re claiming that because bitcoin is potentially about to start having very limited smart contract functionality, which is only just starting after over ten years, and which incidentally also has to run on a separate blockchain with its own miners, that Ethereum’s value proposition is ‘ruined’? What?! 

Ethereum was built for smart contract functionality and settles multiple trillions of dollars in activity every year. The development of evm enabled zk rollups is the most powerful development in decentralized app functionality ever. The network effects are massive; from CBDCs to EY, Microsoft, Baselining, Coca Cola, the invention of DeFi and NFTs, and even Visa settling transactions and writing smart contracts on Ethereum, not to mention buying a cryptopunk before they bought bitcoin.

The fact you felt the need to make this post is itself an indication of Ethereum’s network effects. If you didn’t feel threatened by Ethereum, you wouldn’t feel the need to constantly post FUD in the Ethereum subreddit.

There have been dozens of smart contract platforms that have tried and failed to make Ethereum obsolete. Basic smart contract functionality is literally the very first hurdle and bitcoin is years and years behind and is developing horrendously slowly because it’s a square peg for a round hole.

Also, as long as bitcoin remains proof of work in these times of energy shortage and climate anxiety, with centralized mining farms capturing ever more of the share of hashrate because they get more per $ they spend, and as long as bitcoin has no longterm security assurance (no one knows whether tx fees of $1m a day will increase to cover the shortfall of continued halvenings; so far, they’re not) it’s not ruining Ethereum’s value proposition in the slightest, as much as you wish it was.

What will be interesting to see is whether there will ever be more bitcoin at work on bitcoin’s smart contracts than the almost 300,000 tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum. That would need to be the very bare minimum..",patiently waiting for someone smarter than me to answer

Smart contracts can call functions from other smart contracts, but in the end it must have been initiated by a user, with a wallet, and the gas fees for everything that gets executed come out of that users wallet right then and there. Either the user has enough and the process completes, or the user does not have enough and the process does not complete.

This can be hard to grasp at first for people that are used to software just running in the background all the time. With DeFi, the smart contract does absolutely nothing unless specifically run by a user who pays for everything that needs to be done.",Don't users pay for the transactions that initiate a state change? Unless you're thinking oracles or roll-up batches,"It can absolutely be written into your contract. Your “DeFi Application” can be as you want, with whatever the function you are wishing to be set automated, or to user call. 

So the application doesn’t change the state of the chain - the smart contract does, it lives in a completely separate place and can be called regardless of your app functionality. If you want your gas fees to be within a certain range when the call is executed or it fails there are several solutions. Really this is such a general question it’s harder to give you specific details without knowing more of the plan. But yes in your contract you can write just about anything you want and “do not execute unless is doable.” 

It may require a second script though that constantly scans for network activity and avg fees and then calls the main contract with the main functionality you want. So rather a do X when Y is met and also a backup DO NOT if such is not true. Clearly that’s not the syntax or language used I’m just trying to give you a general idea. 

Again all of this can be done with or without a personalized application. You don’t need to code an app also.

Oh yea and to answer your question THEY DON’T lol. When all conditions aren’t met then it won’t happen. I’d assume some basic functionality coded in for use of gas fee settings and adjustments on any basic application. But again this is different from the smart contract and that’s what actually makes shit happen. You don’t need those fancy gas fee settings on your interface because your contract has that functionality or should also and doesn’t need the app to call it."

""Is moving my crypto from one exchange or wallet to another a taxable event?  
No, moving your crypto between wallets or exchanges that you own is not taxable.

""Everything bleeds against ETH"" is the mantra. Buying and holding ETH is the braind-dead easy way to gain exposure to everything happening on Ethereum if your time horizon is at least 5 years.","To quote a wise crab: ""I like money""

At this point, the legitimacy of the network is called into question by its users. 

Deeply technical analysts might figure out that the majority of the networks nodes are colluding to act dishonestly, and this is not just a bug.

Then the users may call for a ""user-activated soft fork."" (UASF) 

In a Proof of Stake system, UASF might be used to slash all the validator nodes who voted dishonestly, thus restoring honesty and legitimacy to the network. In a Proof of Work system, a UASF cannot defend against this type of generalized majority attack as far as I am aware and I am not sure there is a simple way to do so.",This would only happen if the majority of other validators on the network are dishonest. In the very unlikely event that happened the community could create a fork that destroyed the ETH of the dishonest validators which would remove them from the network.,They could pull up their registration documents as proof. May be a visit to the local council might get them some paperwork that could come in handy. And lawyer up of course.

The true power lies on the users, not the service providers. If a user does not like the fork chosen by a stablecoin provider, he can simply use his keys to redeem his worth held in the stablecoin and move to a different chain. If sufficient users do this the stablecoin TVL plummets and can as well cease to exist.

The users are the ones in power, we saw this when the miners attempted to revolt because of EIP-1559. They could have left, but they didn't because Ethereum is the most profitable network to mine. And this is because it has the most network fee revenue. It's the users that pay the network revenues, which is what drives both validator revenues and token valuation.

Proof of Work has more centralizing forces than Proof of Stake but I think this deserves a specific post as I keep repeating again and again the argument in minor responses in different places and doesn't get enough visibility.

All in all, she is wrong in multiple accounts. It's OK, she is warming up to the inevitable. It will come, give her time.

Cannot not take a moment to comment on this:

> Ethereum is different in this regard. What we know of as Ethereum or “ETH” today is a hard fork of a hard fork of a hard fork of a hard fork of a hard fork. It purposely updates via hard forks. In fact the minor altcoin ghostchain known as Ethereum Classic or “ECH” is the original Ethereum blockchain, at least out of the Ethereum blockchains that still exist.

No, Ethereum Classic does not deserve the term the original chain. That's what the difficulty bomb is for, so nobody can make this stupid claim.","She writes well, she's smart, but I find her understanding of crypto to be superficial.  In an earlier article she naively compared the hash rates of BTC and ETH as if they were the same thing.  Reported as fact the joke that Vitalik started ETH in response to losing a world of warcrarft match or something like that.

She writes:

> I would argue that a main issue with proof-of-stake is that it can be prone to centralization.

ETH is not currently deflationary, but the burn significantly decreases the inflation rate (by about 60%).

After ""the merge"", ETH's issuance rate will decrease significantly, and it's extremely likely that the burn will be higher than issuance, making ETH deflationary.",Rocketpool staking ETH decentralized.,"New ether is issued to block producers (currently miners and stakers, but after The Merge it will only be stakers).

At the same time the base fee of transaction costs is being burned.

When the amount of transactions are high the base fee will be high and more ether will be burned than is issued in a block.

If the average blocks over time burn more ether than is issued the net effect is deflationary. At the moment this is not the case, while some blocks are deflationary on average the supply is currently increasing, but not by much. 

https://ultrasound.money/

Lots more ether is given out to miners than to validators, because miners need to pay for electricity whereas running a validator has minimal ongoing costs and so issuance can be much lower. Therefore after The Merge the net issuance will almost always be lower than the amount burned.

-------------

As for how to stake with less than 32 ether, the best option would be RocketPool, either running a node if you have 17.6 ether, or by buying rETH if you have less than that. It's a much more decentralized option than staking through an exchange which means you're strengthening the network and making it more resilient, a sensible choice as it's the network you're investing in!"

Ethereum transactions have a data section, you can just pass your data as data.

Calculations inside the contract cost money while calculations outside the contract are free, so for instance one thing you might want to do is to require your user to sort the input themselves and send it to your contract; That way instead of needing to sort the input, the contract only needs to *check* that it's sorted, and abort (`revert`) if it finds a number that's smaller than the previous one."

Gonna change the game imo,Loopring,"tldr; Ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of approximately $519 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Ether processes 3x the number of transactions per day compared with Bitcoin, which means that it could handle hundreds of thousands of daily transactions. However, for Ethereum to scale to the next level, we still need to solve its scalability issues. Innovative platforms developed Layer-2 to solve these constraints.

Ethereum is explicitly *not* a delegated PoS system. You don't want the actors' stake to consist of other people's money. You want them to put their own money as collateral with a slow exit queue to force them to lose their capital if they do any sort of attack that damages the health of the network.

The closest you'll get to a delegated system is RocketPool, which preserves this ethos by having individual stakers put up 16 ETH of their own and be matched with 16 other ETH coming from smaller stakers. It's all permissionless and enforced by smart contracts such that is the individual staker is evil and gets punished, he's gonna lose his 16 ETH and the rest is withdrawn back to the pool so smaller stakers don't get negatively affected.

Personally I'm of the opinion that this 32 ETH figure should change dynamically over time to target the optimal amount of active stakers, but I don't understand the current PoS spec well enough to understand if/why that's a bad idea. Maybe some day I'll propose my own EIP about it lol",I don't think there are any plans to lower that limit of 32 eth per validator so better get used to pools at least for the near/medium term. Personally I vouch for RocketPool!,"There are no plans for the base protocol to have the 32ETH minimum lowered or for there to be any kind of delegation mechanism. Delegated PoS was actively decided against due to its drawbacks. 

If you want to stake with less than 32 ETH, RocketPool is a great place to start."

as others have mentioned, there are trustless staking options available!","I can’t give the definitive answer (someone knowledgeable will hopefully) but I can point out that what you’re asking is to reduce the “stake” that’s required in Proof of Stake.  

All of the nodes need to trust your node is financially invested in the network and won’t work against it.  They trust you because you “proved you have a stake” in the network and therefore want it to function properly.  

If the minimum requirement for proof of stake nodes is reduced then it becomes cheaper to attack the network","I believe the number is based on the target number of validators the network should support, rather than the dollar amount.

For example, if it was 1 ETH then the networking gossip would likely be too high across a huge set of validators - so 32 ETH was chosen.

Go to the sub ask them why,"I think it's fair to have fundamental concerns around whether the layer 2 centric world is ever going to be user friendly. If you look at l2beat.com there are also many concerning 'critical' issues with most layer 2s currently, mainly around centralization and them being able to cheat or freeze assets without easy recourse. It probably doesn't matter for NFTs since people will just leave them on a L2 with a marketplace. But DeFi will suffer from the loss if liquidity when you split dapps across L2s. 

Imho a big risk is also sharding taking too long. 'The merge' will do nothing to reduce gas fees or improve performance. Fees on L2 are already rising. This ofc depends on lot on whether people actually use Ethereum instead of just holding (like institutions that but into the space)

From a tech perspective, as much as you can hate on Solana it got some things right. Separating data and logic instead of having a ""smart contract"" that does everything is inherently better for scalability. Solidity has a lot of support but as a software dev: it is NOT a good language.
The 'rent' concept is confusing but having slightly higher upfront fees (when you first interact with a dapp) but then very cheap transactions is amazing for stablecoins. These are all things eth could adopt but it's unlikely given the roll-up centric roadmap.

Generally speaking I also think that by going to proof of stake and giving up some decentralization (fewer people running full nodes, high startup cost to become an individual validator) you could ask: why not go a step further and accept a bit more centralization for a better experience on L1?

For me there are really only 3 interesting projects: 
Bitcoin because their proof of work as unique characteristics and the jury is still out on whether proof if stake can offer the same resilience.
Ethereum because MAYBE sharding and roll-up centric is the way to go and Eths proof of stake is probably the most decentralized (at the cost of performance) of all chains except BTC.
Solana because the whole approach is novel and as a software engineer I agree with a lot of the engineering tradeoffs they have made.

All the 'we forked geth and made it faster' projects don't really offer anything that would justify people moving away from Eth IMHO (like avax, polkadot). projects that are too single purpose (like Terra) will also have hard time competing in the long run. The problem with almost all proof of stake chains right now is also a hard limit on decentralization (like Terra with max 130 validators), which will also not bode well in the long run.",I hate that I don’t have enough Eth in my bag

You won't need to use title companies or anything like that, your local government can just create a contract (NFT) giving you ownership of the house and send it to your social-recovery-enabled wallet. Then you can just use cryptographic digital signatures for all the relevant legal work. 

The neat part then is with your house on-chain, if you wanted to you could use it as collateral in DeFi (theoretically). This'll be way down the road so DeFi will have had time to settle down and become a lot safer. 

There are a lot of hurdles to jump in order to get there, but I think the future is pretty bright.",,

Yes stable coins are largely modified ERC20 tokens, in fact most ethereum tokens are modified ERC20 that’s why we have ERC20, a standard for tokens to implement so we know what to expect from them when calling the contract. 

2. USDT is a centralised stable coin, not a algorithmic stable coin means USDT is not controlled by a smart contract but by the people behind it, they take $1 from someone and issue 1 USDT to that person. This is one of the major issue we have with centralised stable coins like USDT, we don’t know if there is enough fiat backing these, in fact USDT has always been very fishy with their audits. 

On the other hand we have algorithmic stable coins which supposed to be managed by a complicated balance of incentive design powered by smart contracts e.g Fei protocol. But algorithmic stable tokens are hard to engineer, we still have not master it 100% yet, there are plenty of failures like the Empty Set Dollar.","In addition to the Tether, there are many more coins.

Even better, wETH is minted by sending ETH to a smart contract, which locks the ETH until the wETH is burned. So if you mint the wETH yourself, no swap of any kind occurrs, since your ETH is just ""stored"" until you return the wETH.","Kinda dumb lol. Especially not with the volatility and you can only borrow a lower amount than your holdings. Also can get liquidated if not careful

Send it through tornado","Unfortunately there's no firm guidance here. I've seen decent arguments both ways saying it is or isn't a taxable event to wrap ETH into WETH. I lean towards it not being taxable myself since WETH only has value because it represents ETH and you can still retrieve your ETH at any time. 

I will say that *if* wrapping ETH->WETH is taxable, I think *bridging* ETH onto another chain like AVAX is also a taxable event. The ETH on Avalanche isn't actually ETH and can't be used the same way regular ETH can, because they've replaced that functionality with AVAX. Bridging BTC to wBTC would also be taxable. 

With that in mind, the best way to do this is to use your mainnet ETH as collateral in a lending protocol like Aave, Maker, Liquity, or Alchemix and then use the stablecoins (or alETH) to do the bridging."

With sharding, each one only has to store a small fraction of all the data on Ethereum. That way Ethereum can have a lot more data.

That's a really big deal for rollups, which are basically just limited by data storage. Right now rollups can handle a couple thousand transactions per second. With sharding, that will be multiplied, by a factor of twenty at first and a lot more later.",It’s when you try to fart and a little bit of poop comes out.,"The idea behind sharding is you want to increase the capacity of the blockchain (transactions per second and storage) without directly putting the burden on all validators as that can lead to centralization as costs increase for nodes and smaller more independent nodes are forced to shutdown as they can no longer keep up with the larger load.

So instead of simply increasing block-size or reducing block-time imagine just starting a 2nd, 3rd or how many ever separate blockchains with completely different nodes. This way individual nodes don't have to store all the transactions of all chains, splitting the load. Some store transactions from the 1st and others for the 2nd, 3rd, etc.

That's basically what sharding is, the difference is that the different ""chains"" are typically referred to as shards and are kept under one network so that applications can more easily communicate between shards and so that the security of the main consensus can be shared.

Afaik in ETH2.0 the goal is eventually to only shard state i.e. storage and not computation. So all nodes will process all transactions but the job of storing the blockchain's data will be delegated to different sets of nodes. This will ensure that costs for rollups who mainly rely on ethereum's storage remains low.

Lmk if that was helpful!"

(I know it's not what you said, just in case you ever see this argument)

L1 is expensive **precisely because people use it**, price is set by auctions, if no one were using L1 because it was too expensive let's say and it were useless then it would be cheap because no one would bid on auctions.  

> we are recommended to use L2

I don't know if you took it like that, but you aren't meant to use L2, you aren't meant to use L1 either. You aren't meant to do anything in fact.

It's up to you to choose which chain you want to use in functions of different drawbacks / tradeoff they provide.
L2 isn't strictly better than L1 for multiple reasons:
- L1 have more liquidity, if you create a strategy that needs deep liquidity (imagine yearn for example), L1 is a really strong bet because L1 is the only chain capable to eat that much tokens.
- L1 is still the main meeting point, if you create a dapp that use 3+ other dapps, it is likely L1 is the only place you can use it, because often your first protocol is on ETH and Polygon, second one is ETH and Arbitrum and last one ETH and Optimism. Then you just need to eat the bullet and make it on ethereum.
- L1 is what people want to use. You might think ""wtf but the fees ?"", but that precisely the fees that tell us that. If you go on https://cryptofees.info/, you see that ethereum is where people buy their gas. If people really thought gas was an issue they would try to move an other chain and we would see ethereum's fees go down and alternative cheaper chains goes up. The fact that this doesn't happen means that for now, people think it is worther to stay on ethereum than moving.

# Then the real part:
**most L2s supports solidity**, then solidity is extra better because instead of learning a snowflake language that a single L2 or sidechain use, you can learn solidity which work on L1, most L2s and most sidechains.

Or in other words, learn solidity you can write smart contracts for almost anything.
Learn rust you can write smart contract for solana (yeah solana isn't an L2 nor sidechain, I know, it's still an ""ethkiller"" (I'm not gonna comment on if it suceed or not)).","Nope, you can use solidity almost everywhere, as the EVM is extremely popular and widely available, also on L2's.

> What is DeFi and how it differs from traditional finance?

So far, DeFi has sought to imitate the financial products in tradFi by creating programs that abstract all or nearly all of the functionality of banks and brokerages. 

> How will it change the current landscape of financial services, and what new concepts could come out of this?

Lowers entry barriers for financial products drastically and creates far more efficient financial products. You don't need a New York skyscraper and a thousand branch locations to issue huge loans anymore, you can do it with some smart contracts and a few dozen developers. 

> Is it really ""Decentralised"" (as of today)?

Some apps are, some apps aren't. The smart contracts running most apps are usually decentralized but often times they have upgradable metrics or the frontend web interface is centralized. Some projects like Hop Protocol have managed to decentralize the web page too by using IPFS. 

Of course in most cases you still have to use a CEX to trade fiat for crypto, but that's because of the rules surrounding fiat currency. If you simply get paid in crypto or have someone give you crypto, you never need to touch a CEX if you don't want to.

Ethereum is just less sneaky about that aspect.",I’m super big on podcasts but I can never really get into joe Rogan because I can’t take his opinions as anything more than just opinions and his point of views. When I listen to podcasts it’s from people who are actually specialized in specific fields like doctors or people who are in business or in real estate heavy,"I never understand why people think Joe Rogan is some authority.  I do like that he revealed he is a left-win progressive who identifies most with Bernie Sanders.  Good for him.  But there really isnt anything special about him.  He just was a known celeb who had a rolladex to contact other celebs to appear on his show, which is what put his podcast in the crosshairs for others to watch.  He just lets others speak.  What he adds to the conversation is minimal and rudimentary.  Big deal.

What i'm saying is I prefered him back when he was host of the awesome NBC show: Fear Factor."

This highlights a large part of my thinking around Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is a zealot to the supply cap, and such thinking is what caused the great depression to persist for 43 months.

Because Ethereum knows that the system is there to serve people, firstly, it is a system that can deal with the social implications of the economy. It has shown this time and time again as it evolves and adjusts to circumstance. Ethereum is for humanity. Bitcoins ideals do not place humanity at it's center.

Reason 1: there are multiple public statements from SEC Chairmen in the past saying Ethereum today is not a security. This would be a absolute bitch for the SEC in court.

Reason 2: contrary to 99,9% of alts, Ethereum actually is decentralized and the SEC knows it. They would just hurt themselves trying to regulate something that has no one in charge.

Ripple is going down, and they're trying to drag down ETH and BTC with them. But I doubt the SEC has _any_ interest in going after Ethereum.

Remember, they can't prosecute the original sale, since it's been over 5 years so the statute of limitations has expired.

They can only go after current sales, which basically means preventing any sale of ETH within the US. And that's a great way to get all retail holders, plus half of wall street pissed off at them."

Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Alexei Navalny's chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, have condemned the proposal. Volkov pointed out that it’s impossible to ban cryptocurrency in Russia. The ban is unlikely to stop unscrupulous players, but it will put an end to legal Russian projects.

It's started last year with Hermez merge for $250m, Nightfall collaboration with EY, Miden, and recently Mir acquisition for $400m

Polygon invested into those teams, each of them experimenting and developing ZK-based L2 solution for Ethereum with different approaches:

* Hermez = SNARK
* Miden = STARK
* Zero = SNARK + STARK
* Nightfall = Optimistic + ZK

What does it means? Idk much, not a dev Xd. What do I get is that Hermez may similar to [ZkSync](https://zksync.io/), Miden similar to [Starkware](https://starkware.co/), Nightfall similar to [ZKOpru](https://zkopru.network/)

Again, not a dev. Don't trust my word. Someone correct me if I'm wrong plz

[https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/31/finalized-no-33/](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/31/finalized-no-33/)

Additionally, Carl wrote about these anti-correlation incentives here --

[https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/01/13/validated-staking-on-eth2-1-incentives/](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/01/13/validated-staking-on-eth2-1-incentives/)

&#x200B;

Superphiz is just asking for a community member to dig deep into these scenarios and make it abundantly clear what the impact of each of the scenarios could be on the network and user funds \*in one place\*. Tbh, this not ""unknown"" and is written about in various places, not to mention baked into the spec. Superphiz just hopes to get it all in one place, clearly presented for institutions and homestakers alike.

&#x200B;

This video is poorly researched, a personal attack, and fud","lmao what's with the extreme hostile attitude tho? If you want to participate in the client diversity discussion, you are more than welcome to do so. Client diversity isn't even a controversial thing, you're literally the only one making a fuss about it for like no reason other than your personal vendetta against /r/ethstaker and superphiz.

People ask questions all the time and get answers, superphiz is a super standup dude. I checked your user history quickly and see no evidence of your comments/posts in /r/ethstaker having been removed, what I did find was superphiz being [very upfront](https://reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/r4kvvp/rocketpool_criticisms/hmppf00/?context=10000) about why you're banned and it honestly lines pretty well with what I'm seeing from your videos. Otherwise all your criticisms of rocketpool and personal attacks against him are still very much up, which is not something you'd expect from the tyranical biased paid-by-rocketpool moderator you try to portray him as.

There has been plenty of explanation given about the risk of a supermajority client having a bug leading to a very undesirable outcome for every ETH holder/user/stakeholder. The probability of such a bug is not easy to calculate, but as long as as there's a supermajority client, the risk/reward curve of such a bug is unacceptable. Unless you can guarantee 100% bug-free client implementation, the only way to bring the odds of such a catastrophic event to 0% is through client diversity. This is very easy to grasp with the Ethereum knowledge you seem to have. Testnets are great but bugs can still make their way to mainnet, as [we've seen in the past with Prysm](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-mainnet-incident-retrospective-f0338814340c). Their response was great, but that wouldn't be enough if a Prysm bug finalizes a block that other clients don't accept. That is of course unless they can locate the issue, issue a patch, and get everyone to update to the latest release before the chain finalizes within 7 minutes.

Superphiz didn't admit what you think he admitted, his post is about gathering data and evidence for data-driven risk-adjusted investments from large stakeholders running a lot of validators. He's also been very transparent about his initial approach of targetting solo stakers being unproductive compared to targetting the big exchanges running Prysms that could sidestep the whole issue by diversifying their own clients.

But again, your criticism seems way more personal than technical."

No, gas fees are a function of supply and demand which means they move independent of price. The only correlation you can argue is that a higher price means more people use Ethereum increasing gas fee demand. There is no direct correlation like you have mentioned in your post.

Think about it for a moment, if what you were saying is true why don't we just stock split Ethereum and give everyone 10x more, but decreasing the price 10x. This does not make gas 10x cheaper","There will be new solutions hopefully for cheaper gas fees in the future. But they continue to be a problem and already price out a lot of people. Nobody knows for sure how it will evolve. Gas fees are high when demand on the network is high. It does not directly correlate to the price though. For example: ETH price crashed quite hard recently, at the same time the network got used much more because of the NFT hype and gas got more expensive."

Application and tooling developers, node operators, infrastructure providers and stakers are strongly encouraged to test on Kiln to ensure a smooth transition on existing testnets.

Instead of the validator key being stored on one machine, SSV uses Distributed Key Generation to encrypt and split it into “KeyShares”

But nothing comes close to Rocketpool currently. That’s just the truth. I’m running a minipool and have all other Eth in rETH and I sleep like a baby.,"Main alternatives are Stakewise and Lido.

Good patterns and best practices were underdeveloped and learning resources were hard to find, and when you did find them, they might have been out of date. 
2) Maybe but not anytime soon. Feels like where email was in the late 70s. Took a while to get to the scale we know today and predicting when is impossible because it’s still very early. 
3) There are new attack vectors surfacing all the time. Again, it’s an underdeveloped technology that is still figuring it out. Programmers in the field are in very high demand and stupid money is being thrown around. I’ve only been involved less than a year and I’m finding myself turning down jobs regularly because I don’t have the time.","1. Easy, but Ethereum cant trigger tasks on a schedule so something external is needed. You can probably get started here https://github.com/ajlopez/SoliditySamples

3. Ethereum the network is as secure as it gets. Need a more specific reference to know what you're referencing.",">How easy is it to program an eth wallet such that when payments are made into it, it automatically takes a % of that payment and transfers it to another wallet?

That exists:

I'm not a developer, but check out [eth.build](https://eth.build/), building something like you are describing for yourself seems almost trivial with this tool.

**Going from a name to an address. **

This is mainly what you care about. You want people to be able to search or send money to yourname.eth and it get to your actual address 0x1736382… This is done when you setup your name. 

Any number of names can point to the same address, but each name can only point to one Ethereum address. 

**Going from an address to a name. **

When you connect your wallet to a website, it gets your Ethereum address (not a name). If you set your primary name for an address, websites and applications can look up the address and get your primary name. 0x1736382… can be displayed as yourname.eth. 

Why can’t this happen automatically? Because an address can only have one primary name. Since you can point many names to a single address, the protocol doesn’t want to assume which one is the primary one. 

Example:

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045

Etherscan knows that Vitalik has said this address is vitalik.eth, you can see on the website. Even though any number of ENS names could point to this single address.","No, you don't. I thought the same thing though and when they gave out ENS tokens they gave out double to everyone who had spent gas on that unnecessary step. It was pretty stupid.","i don’t think so, unless you want the ens domain to point there. once you buy into your wallet the domain is yours and transferable."

Sometimes a bad goal, sometimes a good one, it's not really the question. Though I'd expect more funds to be invested into helping others, as it's a pretty easy way to earn a decent reputation. 

With DeFi, what we're seeing is a huge diversification of the stockmarket.

With that number, the results are far from representative and probably wouldn't even justify a survey in a single state. No mention either as to how the survey was conducted. Was it online? In person? By phone? By mail? By fax? Maybe they sent smoke signals?

They don't even show the questionnaire, nor say if they restricted the percentage of respondents for each age range on par with the age distribution in America, and same goes for residence or sex. Were the respondents 50% male and 50% female, just as the sex distribution in America that you would expect for a ""national"" survey? No survey can be trusted if they don't specify how it was conducted. This is the equivalent of toilet paper and the veracity of the facts the same as propaganda.

Carrying an actual national survey about any matter in a country as populated as the US is VERY expensive, which is why governments are usually the few ones taking this endeavour. Having a representative sample of your whole country involves interviewing many elders, and since not everyone uses the internet, big amounts of money go into financing door-to-door interviews. But of course, no mention of that in this study, which affirms to be national, whatever that means according to them."

Due to how rollups work, there's enough data about each transaction to recreate the entire state of the rollup (as far as accounts as concerned) using the data from the Ethereum network alone, even if Arbitrum is down and all off-chain data is destroyed. Short of Ethereum itself going down and deleting all data, everything stored in Arbitrum (except smart contract code, as far as I know) can be recreated, so you should be safe from a worst-case-scenario like that.

That basically leaves censorship and the actual sequencer node (the Arbitrum node responsible for committing transaction batches from the rollup to the Ethereum network) going offline, bringing transaction processing to a halt. For censorship, I believe Arbitrum has mechanisms in place to force transactions through from the Ethereum network, though unfortunately I don't think Arbitrum has any recourse for the sequencer node fully going offline.","Arbitrum is extremely safe, even safer than things like Matic in terms of layer 2s. Arbitrum and to a slightly lesser extent Optmisim are both the safest ways to cheaply use ETH right now. They are enterprise grade solutions by industrial grade teams","If you're keeping it to relatively low amounts, keeping it on an exchange isn't a bad idea. If you really want to get it into cold storage, Arbitrum is safe.

Also I saw in another comment you said Kraken fees are €9?! That's pretty high, I'd start using FTX if I was you, they cover half the transfer fee, so it's currently about €1.5 to withdraw. Otherwise just let it build up on kraken / another exchange until you can withdraw enough to make it worth your while. FTX also let's you withdraw straight to arbitrum.

I'd also recommend getting a hard wallet, but again if it's €50 per month I'd really just recommend leaving it on an exchange for now.

You can also just withdraw to Arbitrum and bridge it to another L2 if you don't want to keep it there, fees aren't going to be huge, but could be a few euro which would eat into your stake, so again, I'd probably just let it build up a bit if I were you."

The bottlenecks of the blockchain trilemma are on-chain data storage and data transfer delays. 

So, either you provide off-chain work, you improve data storage efficiency (compression of data stored) or you somehow improve the communication infrastructure worldwide for better data transfer delays. 

The last point being impractical, that's why most chains are trying to do some off-chain work, compress data or both. And the others sacrifice decentralization by reducing the number of actors handling the consensus.

Not sure exactly in your situation, but exchanges often use multi-sig wallets for security reasons. Multi-sig wallets are built on smart contracts that require multiple signatures to send funds. Normal transactions require only one signature.

>2. My Hardware Wallet only shows the eth balance but not the transaction history like I see on my BTC wallet, when I asked the HW vendor about it they answered the reason for this is because smart contract transactions are not a regular transactions and are not supported by the app.After further research I learned that smart contract transactions aka internal transactions are not recorded on the blockchain.if so, how is it still possible to see the balance of my wallet on sites like etherscan.io? where is this balance coming from?

Internal transactions are not real ""transactions."" I'll try to simplify this as much as I can: smart contracts are code that lives on the blockchain. That code is made up of a series of ""functions"" that can do things like transfer value (tokens, ETH) from one address to another when executed through a ""function call"" by a normal Ethereum address (a regular wallet). These transfers are not necessarily written on the blockchain, although if these transfers involve ETH they will sometimes appear on-chain (requires extra gas).

How sites like Etherscan see all the transactions is to go through the history of the entire blockchain and check for these function calls (which do appear on the blockchain) and essentially re-execute them to see/verify the result in the corresponding contract (all the code is publicly available). It sounds like your Wallet visualizer doesn't do that.","1. Smart contract wallets are safer than the typical seed-based accounts you’re used to, especially when you need a wallet to be owned by a group of people that could change over time.

2. Smart contract transactions are recorded on the block chain. A smart contract transaction can contain any number of internal transactions. An internal transaction is just a transaction that is recorded inside another transaction. It’s all written to the blockchain. I guarantee you can follow the paper trail on etherscan.",

As an example, there was a bug in Facebook where one specific API, urls you call to get certain data, was not protected with authentication and you could call that route to get data from other users. 

What I consider hacking is where someone manipulates the system using extraordinary means to trick the code into a state it was not previously in.

Here is a perfect example: https://youtu.be/dT9y-KQbqi4","In the way those terms are normally used, a hack is an intentional attack while a bug is something unintentional. Hacks can and often do take advantage of bugs, and there's a decent amount of overlap in the terms. 

Example of an attack: Solana Wormhole bridge, where the attacker had to go through very specific steps to exploit the pre-existing bug in the bridge code. 

Example of a bug: When Alchemix deployed their ETH vaults at first, there was a bug in the software that allowed people to instantly withdraw their collateral without paying back their loans.","Just depends how you view it... like a truck and car are different but they still vehicles.

Hack gets thrown around to much to make people think you have some Hollywood type B.S. going on.... in fact they just wrote crappy code and want a scapegoat, so they dramatize it.

If people can't get their code up to par, it's their own fault. Maybe they need to go code for Google play or iOS before playing with the big boys."

> If you can save 90% on fees, customers don’t seem to care if their dex is on ethereum or avalanche

They care where the applications and assets are. DEXs are commodified, but Ethereum is still where all the most valuable assets and most used applications live.

Ethereum is the top L1, Uniswap is the top DEX, Curve is the top stable-swap DEX, Aave is the top lending market.

The only application that's really challenging Ethereum's dominance is Terra/UST, which is neck-and-neck with MakerDAO.","There are more dynamics at play here.

If there is 10 billion dollars worth of liquidity in a pool on uniswap and only 100 million dollars worth of liquidity on a similar pool on a avax dex then even with the lower fees, the slippage loses on avax will be much much higher. 

This means that 10 billion dollar pool is going to see much more volume and therefore over a higher return to the liquidity providers.

This is some kind of network effect that is hard to beat short term.

Long term it will get beat because the collective capital of millions of people will be much larger then that of a small group of whales.

And those millions of people will gravitate toward the lowest fee chains. 

So the next 5 to 10 years, the network effect will still gravitate toward Ethereum but the next 15 to 30 years it will gravitate toward the lowest fee dexes. 


Eventually the future will be multi chain interconnected by layer 2's but not until the chains with the best trade offs has arisen. The highest possible security with the fastest  possible transactions and the lowest possible fee.

In the next 15 to 20 years we are going to see a DeFi chain that can manage to provide enough security not to get taken over, while offering fast enough transaction and the lowest fee get the L1 network effect. 

But for now Ethereum won't be beat.","No they won't, demand drives gas prices, not eth price"

The majority of the APY on it is also paid in BAL, not more rETH or ETH. 

In real terms, you're getting decent BAL rewards (7.8-19.5%) but you're only getting ~2.14% APR in ETH/rETH including trading fees. If BAL does well and you have enough in the pool to make it worth compounding, this is great! But if BAL doesn't do very well and you're not working with enough to compensate for mainnet gas fees, this isn't really worth it. 

Compare that to the rETH-wstETH pool where both assets are yield-bearing derivatives and you get a base ~4% APR from staking. Then you also get ~.03% from trading fees, and if you stake the LP token in Convex you can get another 5-10% paid in CRV and CVX once the rewards from Tetranode's gauge vote resume soon. 

The other decent opportunity I know of is Alchemix's Rocket rETH vault, which lets you deposit rETH and mint alETH which can be redeemed for ETH and then you can use that ETH for whatever you want. The loan is then paid off through the staking APR.","Moron.

What is under token holders' control so that they have any power? Can't users just stick to the old implementation?","As far as I understand it you're completely correct. That's why we see stuff like UniSwap V3 and AAVE V3 roll out, but are still free to use the previous versions.","Smart-contracts can have variables that can store all sorts of stuff including fee rates, these variables can be set to only be changeable by the dao that owns the protocol or a multisig the developers control.

These variables can also be pointed towards other contracts, so what some dapps do is that they create an upgrade contract that points to which smart contract the dapp should use so when the developer wants to upgrade the smart contract they just post the new smart contract on chain and then use either the Dao to vote so that the upgrade contract points to the new smart contract instead of the old or do it themselves with a multisig key.

This kind of upgrade ability is sometime necessary since some smart-contract are too complex to be sure enough that there aren't any breaking bugs but this upgrade ability also gives the people in control of the upgrade contract full control over the dapp so it should be avoided if at all possible. 

If it is absolutely needed then the control of it should be carefully thought trough for example Zksync has a 15 key multisig that can immediately upgrade the contract if 9 keys sign but the keys zksync control can only que an upgrade so that the community has a month to react and verify the upgrade before it switches over to the new smart contract.

Uniswap V2 is non upgradeable so it will be the same for as long as Ethereum exists, here you can see your effect too, that it takes longer for people to move over and some won't move over at all.

I see this as one of the  biggest unsolved problems of the Smart-contract space since most new contracts are too complex so that if they aren't upgradeable you risk user funds being stolen by a hack because the developers aren't able to move people over to a safe contract without publicly announcing that there is a weakness in the contract which could lead to hackers stealing user funds before the users are able withdraw them themselves. If you have upgradeable smart-contracts then you give the team god mode so they can run away with the money if they want. If you give a dao control of the upgradeability then you risk attackers being made aware of the vulnerability before the dao can gather enough votes to upgrade the contract. 

I think Zksync's solution is the best since they have spread the keys out across a wide spread of industry leaders so collusion is very unlikely unless there is a real threat and they can upgrade the contract with a delay without involving the other key holders so you aren't nagging them unless it is absolutely necessary.

Just as much as gas is worthless to someone who doesn't know how to use it. Or just as much as cow meat is nearly worthless to a vegan. 

You may want to talk about subjective utility or subjective value. But intrinsic value shows a profound misunderstanding of dependencies between entities and properties.

Yes, a popular one is called ""Ganache"". It's basically a simulated ETH network on your local computer, and you can deploy various contracts to it. It comes with built-in accounts with thousands of ETH so it's easy to spin up a new chain to test contracts.

If your contract needs other tokens like USDC or DAI or whatever, you can deploy those as well by copying the contracts to your local test chain or you can deploy on a public testnet like Goerli where those tokens already exist.","Brilliant thanks all, looking up those suggestions.

>  I thought the activation of it is still a debate between the core devs and is yet to be confirmed

No, it's not really up for debate. The bomb is already part of node software and starts to go off in May. It will make the network unusable towards the end of July (the Ice Age of Ethereum). The question being answered by the developers tomorrow is whether or not the Merge will be ready to ship before the ~end of July deadline. I'm thinking they'll probably opt to delay the bomb, and the community will have another hard fork similar to Arrow Glacier where it simply delays the bomb again for X months. 

What happens when they delay the bomb is that they write new node software (Geth, Erigon, Besu, etc.) with the new bomb date. Then all the nodes on the network are asked to update to this new version. Nodes have the option to *not* upgrade, but realistically there's no reason to not upgrade and the Ethereum community is very much in agreement that the merge should happen when the developers are ready for it.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/22/what-is-ethereums-difficulty-bomb-and-should-inves/,what were the arguments about?

The glaring mistake is thinking that any human activity should be split among everyone evenly among arbitrary characteristics of hair color, eye color, skin color, religion, place of birth or anything else.

Let me do whatever I want without forcing me to take part of any and all activities you think you have an even distribution over your arbitrary measures.

The problem of diversity is when people are prevented by others to take part into an activity based on arbitrary characteristics. It's by definition not the case in a trustless environment, because no one knows the hair color of a wallet. It's just a wallet. 

It's so trustless you don't even know if one wallet isn't just owned by the same person as another wallet. Or even if one wallet isn't owned by more than one person.

By trying to force people to be evenly distributed into all activities, you're considering people to be yours slaves you have a right to move among activities at your convenience. It's a freedom problem. 

You're also trying to remove the specialization advantage of people at the tasks they prefer to do. It's a market efficiency problem.

Stop doing that. You're hurting others. Focus on maintaining trustlessness and developping as many services as possible within it. It will do the rest for you.","This is one of the dumbest articles I’ve read on the internet. Minorities of any kind can use crypto, it’s never been an issue.

When video games were for ""nerds"" and ""losers"", no one bat an eye that it was mostly white-male dominated. Then the industry exploded with streaming, e-Sports, and most importantly, **money**. It because ""cool"" and mainstream, so suddenly video games had a diversity issue.

Same with crypto, it became ""cool"", mainstream and most importantly, there's a lot of **money** in it. So now it has diversity issues. Where were these diverse people back in the day, when BTC was \~1$?

That being said, the block times *are* getting higher because the difficulty bomb has already started to go off. If you don't know what that is, it is an upgrade programed into the Ethereum code to start raising the difficulty at an exponential rate after a certain block height has been hit. (It was hit about a week or so ago)

The theory that the developers used when they put it into the code is that it would force the blockchain to undergo upgrades to defuse it (i.e push it forward), which should *in theory* give the developers a reason/incentive to work faster to get upgrades prepared in time for the hard fork.

- StarkGate Alpha mainnet bridge is LIVE. You heard that right. As of today, you can bridge ETH from mainnet to StarkNet and back! It's early though, so it has a cap of $100k USD. Testing, testing, testing. Security is the name of the game.

- StarkNet full node #2 - Juno is now live and has successfully synced up to block #94. Early days, but this is now the second full node implementation!

- StarkSwap x iearnfinance collab - yep. They're collaborating on a DeFi pooling system where you can access L1 dApps from L2 with the cost of an L2 interaction by pooling many user transactions together!

- http://cartridge.gg gaming wallet - improved UX for StarkNet games.

- MatchboxDAO grants program announced - if you're looking to dive into Cairo and want to build a game or game component, this one's for you.

- updates, updates, updates. So many libraries being released every single week. Someone implemented CRISP from the Paradigm paper.

- fun fact: The Otherside mint on StarkEx would have cost only 0.25ETH under ideal conditions. Really makes you think, huh?

Make sure to check out the full post linked above. Thanks for reading, ignore the charts for a while and I'll see you guys again next week!","tldr; This is the 15th edition of the weekly comprehensive StarkNet summary. This week’s newsletter is made possible thanks to ZigZag Exchange, an order-book DEX that will be live on StarkNet soon. The latest Argent X update features 3D NFT support, Send & receive NFTs, and improved flow to add funds to wallets.

https://dataalways.substack.com/p/pos-cantillon-effect?s=w","tldr; In a proof-of-work system, a lower inflation rate leads to less usage and less spending, while a higher inflation rate encourages more usage and more spending. If the inflation rate of a cryptoasset is higher, there is less incentive to save it, leading to a more active supply. If you want to incentivize transactions, then you need to increase the issuance rate to disincentivize absolute saving of coins.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*","Good article. Pretty on point. 

Well, the protocol doesn't need to favor either deflation or inflation. That's why it doesn't. 

What it does is solving some vulnerabilities and reducing unnecessary issuance costs, as staking costs are way lesser than mining costs. Keeping the same token issuance would have been an additional feature of drastically increasing security, way beyond what's currently accepted. It would have needed strong proofs that it was needed. 

Among the vulnerabilities that are solved: 

* increased beyond profitability level the cost of manipulating gas price with transaction spam, thanks to gas being burnt; 

* increased censorship resistance by switching from PoW to PoS, as such allowing any consensus actor to be as anonymous as they desire to avoid any risk of coercion from anyone else; 

* solved the 51% vulnerability of PoW through layer 0 consensus adoption. 

The fact ETH is most probably becoming *temporarily* deflationary as a result is only coincidental.

To be noted that, if ETH price increases without any increase in gas demand, we may just as well end up with a temporarily inflationary currency, because that's what the network self-regulation entails."

But the L1 never sees such network. Rather, to the L1, L2s are just smart contracts on the L1 with people publishing for you a condensed summary of transactions that happen on the L2.

As such, the L2 can ensure in its smart contract that there are functions you can call so that you can withdraw your funds from it yourself, even if the L2 network stops working (like, if they're being coerced and censored or similar events).

Though, you'd also need to be aware that, as L2s are still in development, most of them are still being upgradable. This means there's a vulnerability where the contract can be changed to remove (or worse) such functions normally letting you withdraw your funds.

That's why it's important to see the risks associated with each specific L2 before joining.","Here you go:

Example:
1. Person A wants to buy $10,000 of Luna at $1. 
2. Bot identifies the pending transaction, buys $20,000 of Luna before Person A’s transaction goes through. 
3. Luna is now $1.03 instead due to bot’s 20k buy. 
4. Person A buys $10,000 worth of Luna at $1.03 instead. 
5. Luna jumps to $1.05 due to Person A 10k buy. 
6. Bot sells the initial $20,000 LUNA it bought (probably worth 1-2% more now)

So, copy-pasting the L2s in itself doesn't save any gas. What saves gas is ensuring L2s are as efficient as possible and as many end user transactions as possible happen on L2s rather than on the L1.

What copy-pasting L2s brings is competition between L2s, which is good to explore several different possibilities at once among the huge sea of possibilities available to us, so that we can pick up better and better solutions over time.

Though, what different L2s could offer as increases in efficiency is specialization: an L2 specialized to technically compute and store specific data can become very efficient. Notably, data compression can be tweaked to the specificities of the use cases it covers (geo data for one chain, financial micro transactions for another and such).

Edit: as such, we could even get to a point where each smart contract resides in its own L2, specifically tailored for it and governed by the DAO managing the smart contract. This way, there's no need to repeat each time what this or that transaction entailed exactly, since it's just the result of the same smart contract each time: there's much space to save this way.

And then, you could have some kind of L2 hub(s) where there would be no smart contract except for bridges between L2s, so that most of the traffic comes from and goes to such hub and efficiently saves gas by handling bridge transfers as bundles, in the same way rollups handle their L2 transactions as bundles.",Two L2 doesn’t have twice capacity as one L2,If there the people who own the projects deployed on Optimism don't maintain/upgrade those projects on your fork then it will fall behind fairly quickly and be useless.

* add a radio button to let me choose some different types of transactions, in case I don't know the gas amount. this might be challenging if the gas fee varies on each network
* take snapshots from your APIs at hourly intervals and store them in a database. determine what is typically the best day of the week and the worst day of the week to do transactions in terms of fees

1) The function `dummy_fn()` in the library `DummyMath` is used only in the constructor, which is called only when the contract is created.  But from the occurrence of the constant `0x98765` (shown highlighted in both the source code and the bytecode) it looks like bytecode for `dummy_fn()` is being inserted into the runtime bytecode as well.  As far as I can tell there is no way to access the instructions for this function.  Why is it being added into the runtime bytecode?  
2) What is the function of the code in basic block at 0x5a ?

Solana uses proof-of-history and they rely on a time based on the block time ( e.g. 1.1.2022 + 100 blocks x 400ms). if there is a delay in the block creation and the 400 ms block time is no longer valid, also the current time is no longer calculated correctly.
see: https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274

So...for most of the chains, this is not an issue and its basically standard behaviour that block time differs. Solana is designed differently and therefore there is the issue that the calculation of the current time no longer matches the time of the real world if block time differs. dapps rely on this time and will therefore use a timestamp that does not Match the current time. thats not an issue for many dapps, but some need the correct time and will potentially fail or not work that well anymore.",,

Firstly,[ ""Eth2"" is deprecated nomenclature](https://notes.ethereum.org/@timbeiko/great-renaming). The two major upgrades coming to Ethereum next are The Merge which merges the consensus layer (previously eth2) with the execution layer (previously eth1) - so we're all one Ethereum again! The next major upgrade after that is data sharding on the consensus layer side. Data sharding is actually focused on accelerating rollups. So, Ethereum L1 scalability will be limited for the foreseeable future, while rollups will scale through the roof!

My understanding is that 10% of eth is now locked into the 2.0 staking pools for the merge. These coins can’t be removed for 6 month after the merge. In those 6 months the price will begin to push higher as companies scramble to prepare for issuing the additional coins and be ready for people to cash out. While the cash out will dip the price I think overall it’s not unreasonable to be looking at 6-8k before then maybe even as high as 10-13k if more retail investors begin buying and holding on private wallets.,After the merge and shift to PoS- what will anchor the data to the physical world?

No one wanted it. And now you come claiming that it's what should have happened? Well, that's sad.

But I feel having only one blockchain is extremely hurtful to the market. Satoshi invented cryptocurrencies, with the ability to fork as a way to keep decentralization at the forefront of features. Forking is not a bug, it's a feature. 

Having ""the only one"" was a mistake the Ethereum community made years ago with The DAO. And the Ethereum community learnt from it the hard way. Don't repeat that mistake. Don't concentrate on ""the only one"". Spread.

Notably, different blockchains have different compromises. UTXO, for instance, has a big disadvantage: it means each part of a BTC is uniquely identified and distinguishable from any other. It means full traceability. Some use cases would be hurt by such requirement.

You've also got a lot of claims, here, but without any proof. Only one counter example is enough to show you're claims are way too strong and ends you up into delusional territory. Be careful with that. 

For instance, as for the claim of being unable to build a scalable solution on an unscalable one, L2s are big counter examples, allowing huge scaling on a network that originally can't handle more than ~55 TPS on its L1. 

So, what about all the other claims, exactly? 

Also, you claim BSV is scalable. What is the amount of settled native token transfer it can handle per second, exactly?","> In the end, it is always possible to build a Proof of Stake system on top of a Proof of Work one, but not the other way around.

Most exchanges have “getting started” articles for creating accounts & purchasing, and there are tutorials covering how to choose and set up a hot or cold wallet (like metamask in your browser or a using a leger/trezor), staking, etc. Read up on what “private keys” are before you do anything.

Options for exchanges are sometimes location dependent. Some of the more popular ones include Kraken, Binance, Crypto.com, and Coinbase Pro. Depending on local regulations, you may have to wait for identity verification (like id-based KYC) before you transfer any funds into your account from your bank. I prefer Kraken, but you’ll want to compare fee structures and see what works for you. Personally, I would avoid Paypal. I don’t know enough to back that up, but there’s always a cost for things being made easy. Think of the Robinhood shenanigans, the cost difference between Coinbase Pro and Coinbase, etc.

You can monitor prices using a service like coinmarketcap or coingecko, but you’ll probably just want to set up some kind of dollar cost averaging strategy rather than timing the market. No one can 100% answer where the market is going, so whether it is worth buying at any one time is just speculation. Hence the DCA.

You’ll want to start with a very small amount as you figure out the process. Move slow, be skeptical, and don’t jump into things like defi until you do more research. Make sure to NEVER over invest, and don’t buy on credit unless you 100% know what you are doing. And when you think you 100% know what you’re doing, still don’t buy on credit because no one could.

The reason why I like it is because it’s extremely easy and low cost to automate the check on your wallets for txs not sent in three years or so and once you have that you basically have same system as now but way more peace of mind.

But I am biased because I have tons of DAI stuck in a private key I lost 1 years ago!

What do *you* think?

P.S. I just realized protocol implementation such as this will work for ETH, but aren’t necessary going to work for the ERC20 tokens as a custom transfer function would have to be executed this way. Implantation should probably give right to winner to execute arbitrary calls as EOA.

And you get nothing of what they gain.  So staking pools are risk-transfer mechanisms.  Pool participants (who have k% of the ETH in the pool) bear K% of the proportional risk and get 0% of the reward (of a misbehaving transaction).  Pool operators bear (100-K%) of the proportional risk and get 100% of the reward.  By manipulating K to be as close to 100% as possible, there are vectors where the reward is worth more than the risk to the operators.  Participants be damned.

In any financial system where all the risk goes to participants, and all rewards go to operators, there will be fraud. Guaranteed.  Fraud at the heart of network security is a really bad thing.

And it's not just about one transaction here or there.  

Stakes operational in an epoch are probabilistically distributed. The pool of N total stakes is large thus the chance of any specific stake being chosen for any specific epoch is vanishingly small.  Fine.

But if you control several stakes, then there is a very small, but non-zero chance that several of your stakes will be chosen in an epoch.  As time rises, and as the number of stakes rises, the probability increases. 

This is not linear, but combinatorial.   The more stakes one mind controls, the more likely they will sooner or later have operational control over an epoch.  And all it takes is one of these epochs to create two versions of the truth.  Sure... all those stakes vanish.  But if they were a pool?  Does the operator care?  And what kind of situation can the operator exploit?  They get 100% of the rewards from this exploit, and bear (100-k)% of the slashing costs. The whole math of ETH was designed with k=0.   Such a mind would have to accumulate so much ETH to get this far that they would have a lot of incentive to behave.   Otherwise they would destroy their own wealth. 

But if it's your wealth they are destroying and not theirs, they don't really have as much at stake. 

Staking pools leave open the door that someone with almost nothing at stake could be staking (operationally - by virtue of being able to sign a transaction and therefore behave or misbehave).  

Sufficiently large staking pools - particularly when the actual identity, wealth, opportunity, and legal jurisdiction of EVERY PERSON who can generate and sign a transaction is uncertain, pool participants are increasingly exposed to folks who have very little, approaching nothing, at stake."

It bans any smart contract that kills humans. An anonymous investigator presents evidence of what the app is doing, and an anonymous jury confirms its validity; instantly, the contracts for DevilsBridge and DevilDAO no longer function.

Sounds so neat and tidy, doesn't it.

So, imagine there's an abortion clinic that has a dapp for processing its payments or for anonymizing its patients or something. Or a handgun manufacturer that uses the blockchain for tracking the weapons it manufactures. Maybe the local state government pays the salary of judges via crypto, and those judges may sentence people to death under that state's legal code. Does it matter if those judges are in Texas or in China? How about the military's payroll, can it be processed via the blockchain? Which militaries? American, Ukrainian, Russian? Is military blockchain activity treated differently during peacetime and wartime? How about companies that produce environmental toxins that cause a statistical increase in death rates around their facilities?

I can't imagine that there's anyone who would agree that all of these things should be classified as ""smart contracts that kills humans"", or that none of these things should be so classified. There's going to be endless disagreement about where to draw the lines.

Examples:

* They decided to do re-genesis and wipe away blockchain history TWICE. Basically deleting the production blockchain. While balances were kept, this made it extremely difficult for people to see historical data, which is critical for tax reporting, debugging, etc.

* Despite raising tens of millions from VCs, they barely invest in the public RPC nodes, causing end-users who use Metamask, etc to be unable to interact with Optimism for hours at a time whenever they have heavy load. The fix is simple: host more RPC nodes, except, they'd rather pinch pennies and save a few hundred dollars a month by not provisioning enough infrastructure. This example was particularly highlighted when the OP token launched (which was a disaster btw), and it caused all the public RPC nodes to go down. Because no one at the OP team thought an airdop would cause more load than normal.

* This is the worst move: When the OP token was deployed and trading commenced on exchanges, multiple members of their team redeemed their airdrop directly via the smart contract, dumped the tokens, before releasing it publicly on the website. They sold tokens at $12/coin and intentionally delayed the public airdrop until they've sold and cashed out. This evidence is all there and public on the OP blockchain. When I posted links to Etherscan about why team members were dumping 'community' airdrop tokens before the airdrop was publicly available, I was immediately banned. In fact, I think they have a discord bot that automatically bans you if you post those etherscan links.

I won't bother to enumerate all the amazing things I think are coming in the future with Ethereum. That said, I really can't see the merits behind NFT's in gaming given how gaming actually works.

I suppose the idea is that players can sell their items on an open market, which is cool, but unless the game itself is open source with a P2P network instead of centralized servers (ignoring what this would do to latencies), one is still relying on the game developer to keep the game running. If you are relying on the devs and publishers already to keep the game going, you might as well just rely on their regular old databases to keep track of item ownership. What are NFT's doing in the gaming space that a Postgres database wouldn't solve more simply?

It's entirely possible I'm just ignorant, but I just don't see it. Unless the game is open source and network communication between players happens without centralized servers then NFT's in the game, from my perspective, can be at most a bolted on meme.","tldr; Immutable, an Australia-based web3 gaming firm, has launched an inaugural $500 million developer and venture investment fund.

Just like no brick wall or gun helps with any mass shooting. It's always people. Responsibility always is to people, not to objects. 

It's scams that help, here. Scams performed by scammers, who are the people responsible for this. Scams exist for way before crypto and have stolen the funds of many people. It's just that crypto is an incredible ecosystem where you can very easily and publicly see whenever there's been a scam. But scams are everywhere, it's just way less visible elsewhere. There's a reporting bias, here. 

For instance, most scams still happen on the phone. There are so many such scams that entire organizations operate these activities, to the point you even have lots of videos of phone scams being recorded by people who try and catch them to show them on YouTube and explain how they work. 

All these scams happen on the phone. Yet, we're blaming people, not the phone. And when it's on the blockchain, we suddenly blame blockchain. That's an obvious double standard fallacy designed to scapegoat crypto. 

Stay safe, people. And keep being skeptical.","Good. They have the right to nuclear weapons. After all, they’ve never used them. And do *you* know what the US did to Korea?"

I don't trust them due to the reasons you've posted in this article. Giving up the security of L1 defeats the entire purpose of Ethereum in my eyes.  


>NXTP is a locally verified system specifically designed to be as secure as the underlying domains while still being usable on any domain.

But it still isn't using L1 is it?","I feel your description of trustlessness is incomplete. Trustlessness is a spectrum, all the way from ""You don't have to trust anybody"" to ""You have to trust the collective user base"" to ""You have to trust someone (or a group) that is trustworthy"" to ""You have to trust some unknown or shady person or group.""

Yes, ""who is verifying the system"" is one important example of where trustlessness commonly comes up, but it's by no means the only factor in this space.

Another absolutely critical factor is transparency: is the project open source? What is the process for introducing changes? What are the incentives for those working on or participating in the network? etc.

I haven't looked too deeply past your post on what the answers to these questions for connext is, but if the answers are good this does sound exciting. Bridging between L2s in a user-friendly, cheap, trustless way is definitely critical for the future of the Ethereum network.","So how does the cross chain call work without external verifiers without adding code to the clients for every L1. Do you run your own external verifiers running modified code?

Not true. It will be the case only as soon as ETH will be able to be unstaked. No sooner. Before that, sometimes you will buy it at a premium, sometimes at a discount, depending on how many people want to own it compared to how much there are. Prices can and will continue to fluctuate.

\*in a year or whenever the devs have finished implementing stake withdrawals.

And here lies a problem in a bear market. The ability to get 1 ETH in the future might be worth less than 1 ETH now if you expect the price to drop in the meantime.

So it is perfectly natural that stETH trades lower now than 1 ETH. Ethereum won't break and Lido won't break because of this either. But it might be problematic for all protocols that accepted stETH as a collateral under the assumption that it would NOT drop under 1 ETH, because there might now be positions that become undercollateralized."

There are 3 main upgrades coming to Ethereum. 

First is the move to proof of stake aka the merge. Testnets are running and this is likely to happen in the next 2 months. 

Second is Danksharding. Here’s an article on it with some links to other articles in it. 

https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/08/scaling-ethereum-beyond-the-merge-danksharding/

Danksharding means the chain is split into lots of chains, starting with 64 but potentially many thousands. These shards cannot execute EVM instructions instead they can only store data. Roll ups are executed offchain and just post the proof to the chain as a chunk of data so work perfectly with Danksharding. 

The third upgrade is statelessness which means the size of the state of Ethereum stops increasing and starts decreasing so you can still validate without a massive expensive hard drive.","They will only lower l2 fees by providing data availability, at least at first, but maybe forever as l2s are meant to be the main way to send transactions eventually https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/","I think it's hard to predict. On the one hand, danksharding will technically only benefit L2's. So from that perspective it seems correct to say that it will not affect fees on the base layer. On the other hand, if L2's have become much more efficient with danksharding, then maybe they will take a lot of traffic away from the base layer, so that fees on the base layer will be lower? I would expect that there is at least a small effect from this, but it might not be very noticeable. All in all, I'm pretty sure that the base layer will never again be as cheap as it was in 2016 when a transaction cost $0.02."

In the eight years since, there's been plenty of opportunity for anyone else to buy in at low prices. October 2015 got down into the crowdsale price range, under half a buck per ETH. Much of 2016 was under $10 per ETH.

But what if you got into crypto later? Bottom of the 2018 bear market, an ETH cost $82. It stayed around $100 for a good while. In spring of 2020, the ETH price got down to $110, so you could buy a full validator for about $3500.

Basically, if you were paying attention in the early days and weren't homeless, or finally caught on by 2020 and had some reasonable savings, you could easily buy a validator....as long as you hadn't been brainwashed by bitcoin maximalists complaining about the ""70% premine.""",">when 70% eth was pre-mined 

When did this turn into a percentage? 70% of what? This is a clear sign that whoever gave you that stat is either dishonest or outright didn't know what they were talking about. 72 million ETH - *not a percentage* - were ""pre-mined"", 60 million of which were sold publicly and all anyone had to do was send bitcoin to a widely publicized address. No KYC no nothing. Of the remaining 12M (16% of the initial 72M if you insist on a percentage) only about 350k are still in the hands of the Ethereum Foundation. That's 0.3% of the supply, hardly enough to do anything wrong after PoS.

People can call that a scam, a security offering, whatever. The truth is more people had a reasonable access to these 60 million initial ETH worth pennies, than the millions of bitcoin that were mined for those first few years when only a few people knew about Bitcoin. After 7 years of PoW rewards increasing the total supply and multiple bull/bear cycles, ETH has changed hands plenty of times and the coin distribution is pretty much [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb)

>solid explanation of how PoS will avoid being misused by large entities like Vitalik, exhanges, banks like GS etc.

You'll need to be more specific with ""being misused"". 51% attack? Let them get slashed. Change the rules on a whim? Not how it works, there's no on-chain governance. Here's [my thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/tijcq1/stuff_rethereum_should_know_proof_of_stake_edition/) on a bunch of other usual talking points about PoS, I hope it helps clear up more stuff.

2. Whether to go POS or not and the security budget.

The first is more important, but the second will split the community in half.

Over the next few years Bitcoin has some very big complex arguments to navigate as a community. It’s going to be ugly.

However there was a lot of good discussion recently about the need to change, and ways to change so I’m optimistic sentiment is starting to shift.","Is it Türing complete? 

If not with gas, how does it handle DDoS attacks and dynamic demand for the scarce resource blockspace is? 

Is it fungible or using UTXO? 

Can it solve the real world use case of a few sellers having millions of buyers?

Why sell all alts if that network is supposed to cover the use cases Ethereum covers? It's as if you renounced to Ethereum use cases as you learnt this tech was supposed to cover them. It doesn't seem logical.

>Why would anyone use multiple different cryptocurrencies when you can do everything on Bitcoin

You're confusing cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. Using several cryptocurrencies is how you handle specific economic activities for each cryptocurrency. Just like when you have coffee machine tokens that are specific to a coffee machine. If you don't know this, I don't know if you actually know about Ethereum use cases and if you have enough knowledge to claim that a network covers all Ethereum use cases."

This is a great resource:

https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum/

The TLDR is that data availability for computation and proving is a different requirement than state reconstruction. There are multiple approaches, which this Delphi report captures excellently.","The data availability that really matters is the moment that the data is published. You need to introduce another assumptions to make sure people would download and keep those data. 

The data availability requirement cares about a malicious actor can not publish a commitment but withhold the pre image data for the commitment. To have that guarantee, you require a full node to see that preimage and compute commitment from it, or at least to have high confidence that preimage is published (DAS approach), to tell the commitment is valid.

In rollups, we check this via computing commitments of l2 tx from the calldata. The full nodes in the network must recompute the commitments from the calldata to tell the corresponding l1 block is valid. So you have guaranty that the preimage l2 txs data are really published, guaranteed by the l1 full nodes. 

After the validation of L1 block, the full node still keeps the calldata for people to query. But that's all irrelevant to the data availability requirement. 

We can give an example of doing data availability wrong. Suppose in your rollup submitL2Block function, you forgot to implement the compute l2tx merkle root part. Instead, you let the sequencer to submit l2txs and l2tx merkle root by themself. Then they can actually publish a dummy l2tx merkle root that's not computed from the l2txs data they submitted. The other way to see it is that the preimage of the merkle root is unavailable. With the incorrect commitment or unavailable preimage, you have no way to build fraudproof or zkproof for the l2 state.",

L2 will retain it’s current role.,"The merge doesn't actually change anything besides switching the network to PoS. 

What you are referring to happens after sharding and the misconception is that sharding will fix fees on the base layer. That is false sharding only helps Layer 2s run better -- it does nothing to L1 Ethereum. 

Ethereum's future is in L2s--in the future all ETH will be in L2 and you will basically never interact with the base layer.","Similar question:

Short answer: L2 rollups are part of Ethereum's development strategy, they are going to stay for the foreseeable future.Also don't confuse the merge and sharding. Sharding will be developed after the merge. The current plan is that sharding will reduce the fees mainly *for rollups*."

- StarkNet is preparing for a Regenesis on mainnet. What does this mean? StarkNet accumulated a lot of dead weight in terms of deprecated/outdated features. To shed this dead weight, a regensis will be necessary. That means wiping all of the history on StarkNet. The good news: It will be as easy as possible to port the existing history over to the new StarkNet instance. For more details, read through the linked blog post StarkWare put out.

- ZigZag announcing InvisibL3, a Layer 3 for private transactions. I can not stress enough how excited I am for initiatives like these. Instead of dealing with the rather complicated-to-use Tornado.cash or similar dApps, you will be able to transact and exchange tokens and coins privately on L3, without the horrendous gas fees as well.

- Bulletproofs are now on Cairo. Bulletproofs are a zero knowledge proof system which allow for short inner product, range, shuffle, and arithmetic circuit proofs. Bulletproofs also support faster MPC protocols.

- AAVE StarkNet deployment moves along. Phase 1 has concluded. There was a vote for Part 2 of Phase 1, which has passed two days ago with 0 votes against. This proposal was about unlocking funds from the AAVE DAO to cover the costs of deploying on StarkNet.

- StarkNet community Call #18 - The Nethermind team that is building Solidity -> Cairo transpiler Warp were attending and walking us through Warp.

- The MatchboxDAO hackathon concludes. 1 day left to submit your code, video, and documentation. Winners to be announced next Sunday (1 week from now). Over 50 teams have participated.

- Over 440 ETH have been bridged so far (there's a cap).

- Lots of useful links, articles & dev resources as usual!

Make sure to check out the full post linked above. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you guys again next week!","tldr; StarkNet is preparing for a regenesis on Ethereum Mainnet. InvisibL3 is a layer 3 ZK rollup for private transactions on StarkNet, a feasible add-on to ZigZag Exchange. Argent X is open sourcing Apibara, a tool to build web3 applications. Skyro has released support for StarkNet.

Challenges are matching emerging ZKP solutions with emerging standards like W3C’s DID spec. If all DID’s were authenticated with ZKPs, and all the ZKPs were written to a public ledger, then you could see a completely self sovereign “identity layer” emerge that would allow users to own and manage their identity more robustly.

#ASIDE FROM THE LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION","The ressource consumption is the main motivation for this whole thing. I am really surprised why people just see this as ""one argument among others"".

This climate change thing is the biggest challenge humanity as a whole is facing at the moment. I get it - it's hard to grasp, because it progresses very slowly and you cannot see the danger and each single weather event could also be random, but the sum of it all is undeniable.

However, that being said:

There are some side effects that PoS brings that are also benefits.

\- PoS allows Ethereum to revisit its ""monetary policy"". Since stakers (other than miners today) are not required to write off their investments, the issuance of new ETH can be much lower and people are still incentivized to participate. Thus staking rewards are like 90% lower than today's block rewards. That - together with the current burning mechanism for base fees - will bring inflation down to something very close to zero or even negative values. Good for all users who hold Ether.

\- the slot time in PoS is fixed 12 seconds which is a bit lower than the current average block times. This brings a slight increase in chain throughput. Vitalik Buterin recently pointed out that maybe it could also allow a higher gas limit, because people do not have to plan for a worst case where multiple blocks appear in a short order. Bottom line: expect no wonder, but there will be a small positive effect on throughput and thus gas fees (although gas fees always depend on total usage, so you cannot really compare top before)

\- chain security is better against certain kinds of attacks, because stakers can be slashed and lose parts of their stake.","It will increase the network's security while reducing the cost Ethereum pays for security by about 90%. This is why in combination with the burning of transaction fees we will see ether be a deflationary asset when network use is high.

It will set us up for future rollup benefitting upgrades by making 'blocktime' (slots and epochs) predictably regular. With this in place it allows things like EIPs 4488 and 4844, meaning transaction fees on L2s can probably be reduced by a couple of orders of magnitude in the near future. It currently costs about $0.20 to make swap on Optimism or Arbitrum, if that is dropped to $0.002 then why would anyone use an alt-L1?

And I know you've said not to mention  about the reduced energy use, but just wanted to check you're considering the potential risk avoidance this represents. With temperatures rising, wildfires spreading and crops failing due to drought, climate change is going to be an ever more important political issue. Is there a chance that countries will start introducing regulations around crypto mining? If we're not relying on it then that's not something we need to worry about."

7/21/2022,w4nqmr,0,/r/ethereum/comments/w4nqmr/questions_on_danksharding/,1,ethereum,Questions on DankSharding,">If there will be only one proposer in the Proposer/builder split, won't that make it more centralized?

*Building* a block will be centralized because of MEV, with or without PBS. The next best thing is to split the job of building from the job of proposing so that anyone can easily be a proposer without having to dump a huge investment in the best hardware/bandwidth/algorithms to extract the most value. With PBS that centralization still happens, but its effects are mitigated by democratizing the access to that extractable value to proposers. Then the worst thing the most centralized/powerful builders can do is censor transactions, but with crLists we can force them to include transactions or face an exponentially rising costs (most of which is burned because eip1559, so there is no way around bankrupting yourself if you really insist on censoring transactions)

>What is meant by the term ""bid"" in this sentence

The right to build a block is auctioned off to those builders, and whoever bids the highest gets their block selected by the proposer. Every slot there's one PoS validator selected to propose a block, and he will have several options of ""block bids"" to choose from. By going with the highest bidder, that validator makes more money and the block builder then gets his block included, with all the MEV he was able to extract by rearranging transactions or including his own. (Alternatively the proposer can also propose his own block if that's a better option than the bids offered to him)

>And to clarify, the ""header"" is a data attribute, right?

The header is the section of the block with all the metadata (block number, block hash, previous block's hash, etc.), the body of the block contains the actual transactions. During the bidding process, the proposer (and everyone else) only sees the block headers, and then commits to the header with the highest bid and then the builder reveals the actual content of the block. This is to prevent builders from stealing strategies from each other by just copying what other builders do.

>What role will the validators play in the dank sharding process? 

The role of validators is to propose blocks and then vote/attest on which blocks they believe belongs in the blockchain, and then finalize their blocks. With danksharding they will have the extra responsibility of making sure that the sharded data is available, through ""data availability sampling"" - basically each validator has a small portion of the data, and is randomly asked to provide it by other validators - with enough redundancy so that anyone can query the whole data without every validator storing all of it.

My understanding is it's basically the job of the builder to package all that data, make a big commitment out of it, and then relay it to validators who all get small parts of it. This requires powerful hardware and fast bandwidth, but the genius of danksharding is to realize that MEV is incentivizing this powerful hardware anyway so we might as well leverage their specialized role and have it be unified with data sharding. And of course there's the fallback to less efficient but more decentralized means if there's no builder available to process all the data, so it's not like we absolutely rely on centralized builders, they're just very helpful and can be kept in check so that their centralization doesn't lead to loss of censorship resistance and permissionlessness","1. There is one proposer per block, chosen randomly from the full pool of validators. There's a smaller number of builders because builders have to have fast equipment to collect and order transactions. In a pinch, validators could still create blocks on their own albeit more slowly. It's not any more centralized than it is today. 

2. This is similar to how MEV-boost works. The builder creates a block with as many valuable transactions as they can generate, then they submit that with some ETH to try to win an auction for a block. The proposer for that block simply chooses the highest bidder. Builders are incentivized to perform as much good MEV as they can in order to profit more so they can outbid other builders. As builders copy each others techniques, the profit margins become thinner and more value is driven to validators. 

3. Not sure. 

4. The proposer is a validator, randomly chosen each slot. 

https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177

https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum

https://writings.flashbots.net/writings/why-run-mevboost/

https://docs.flashbots.net/","A block is a package of data that contains a bunch of transactions and a header with other data that's important for the blockchain. The header contains for example a hash and also a signature from the block proposer and other things like that.

Proposers are validators. Validators are like miners in PoW. Proposers get randomly chosen from the set of all validators to propose a block. This means they send a new block to the network and they get a reward for it. We want proposers to be _decentralized_ because proposers can _censor_ transactions, and we don't want that.

However, in proposer-builder-separation, the proposer are outsourcing the work of creating a block to _builders_. A proposer knows that it's their turn to propose a new block a few minutes ahead of time. So they can look in a marketplace of builders who wants to buy the right to create the next block. Builders will _pay_ for the right to create the next block because you can earn a lot of money from that.

Now, proposers are *decentralized, but builders might be quite *centralized*. This is a problem for censorship resistance. The solution to this problem is *crLists* (=censorship resistance lists). The idea is that the proposer makes a list of transaction that they definitely want to see in the next block and give that list to the builder. The builder *must* include these transactions in the block; otherwise the builder will not get paid (there are some clever mechanisms to ensure this). This way, we can ensure that the builders will not censor anyone even if they are pretty centralized."

In practice, decentralization doesn't need any assumption about token distribution in the first place. Even then, the premine could be bought by anyone except US citizens*. And even after the premine, literally anyone could buy tokens for dirt cheap. 

And the rich getting richer is completely false: richer always is relative. What's important is that the rich doesn't get proportionately richer than the poor, which PoS doesn't incredibly better than PoW. But PoW maxis can't accept to recognize that PoW is a rich-gets-proportionately-richer-than-the-poor scheme.

Therefore, even if cross-chain infrastructures will become a solution, it does not seem possible at the moment. But there are promising protocols that have not yet been launched. Magpie, for example. It uses bridges as a messaging service, eliminating the need for bridging. So, token swaps with its automated system will, in theory, be pretty fast, secure, and affordable.","I'm not pretty sure about that, but growing on ETH seams like that ETH will leave Bitcoin in the dust .

I also thought about a qr code being a lite wallet in its own right using a dynamic nft image with updatable meta data.,"The most useful idea I'd see: making QR codes one way and the other.

You have an air gapped device with your wallet on it. You can scan with it the QR codes of requests you have carefully examined. Then, it produces the QR codes of transactions you want to make.

Then, you scan such QR codes with a device that is not airgapped, like a phone, to send the request to nodes.

This way, you control what enters your now not-so-airgapped device and still fully benefits from having a wallet you can easily interact with.

Ideally, for better security, your QR code reader on your not-so-airgapped device should specifically parse every QR code it receives to ensure it fully matches a transaction without possible code injection and lets you review the result."

Having specialized voters handling daily votes for others and allowing to tweak quorum expectations without depriving people from the capability to completely overcome their specialized decisions is a less naive way to implement that.

For instance, you regularly and directly vote for people to handle the decisions. These people only have the power to refuse new rules or to let people as a whole vote for such rules, either with lesser quorum expectations or with higher quorum expectations depending on whether they all agree or not on the new rule.

This way, you ensure voters retain full power, all while allowing a specialized representation to handle the daily voting work and management and focusing voter's attention to the rules that are more polemical or when the specialized voters are misbehaving.",,

There's usually not much disagreement about EIPs because the vast majority are protocol upgrades that improve the network by adding features or make small changes that adds a bit of security, so it's usually not controversial.

When however there is a controversial issue, like the EIP to bail out Parity after the multisig hack, the EIP to implement ProgPoW, or the EIPs to change the ETH mining rewards, there'll be lots of discussions here and on the other Ethereum forums, it will be discussed by the developers on the dev calls, and they'll typically invite people from both/all camps to argue their points. Eventually it will become quite clear that the community favors one or the other option, after which there'll be a new spec released.

At this point, it's up to the client teams to update their software to implement these changes, which they in theory can refuse to do, although I doubt we'll see that happening. I think all client teams have been given funding and some amount of validators by EF to fund development, and I don't know if they would have to give these back in such a case. But this could be considered voting by the client teams.

Then miners can choose whether or not to update their clients, or continue to run with older version that don't reflect the new changes. Here miners could choose to maintain an older fork of the network, which could be considered voting by the miners. Miners will also sometimes include messages in their mined blocks, so signal support or dissent for an EIP.

Finally as a user you can vote with your feet, by choosing to use the canonical chain, or using another fork like ETC.","I’m not sure if this is a troll or not, but Ethereum doesn’t have on chain token governance.","Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js_TjVW8VD4&t=4277s) interview with Tim Beiko where he lays out the EIP process. Basically anyone can propose something, but then it's up to that person to take lead and convince other people it's a good idea to implement the change.

By the time it gets anywhere close enough to be implemented and included into a hard fork, the time for debate (closest thing for ""voting"") is pretty much over and enough people agree that it's worth making the change.

Small non-controversial stuff can more easily make it, but it's still generally an uphill battle that involves a lot of consensus and coordination among the whole community and developpers of the several client teams. It's never as simple as ""Vitalik wants it therefore it happens asap"" as haters and maxis would have you believe (there's even one in this very thread lol)"

The 32 leading bytes of the first dynamically-encoded value in the first tuples would get zeroed when the last component contained a static-sized calldata array. Apart from that, there are several minor bug fixes and improvements like more gas-efficient overflow checks.

Tornado was used widely; Monero really isn't. If Monero were used widely by illicit orgs, you can bet the Gov't would be after it as well. 

https://twitter.com/0xmillie_eth/status/1556999051454865408",">Tornado Cash is an Eth address where people input personal funds to a shared common pool. Ultimately, they will end up in possession of units of Eth which came from other people. This is a cooperative process. A large amount of funds from hacks/crimes are transparently being sent to that common mixing pool.

A liquidity pool is the same thing. Almost all hacked tokens end up in a uniswap pool being exchanged to ETH, so with that logic by swapping on a dex or providing liquidity you also possibly change money with a criminal. So they would have to shut them down too.

But they dont, because its not the reason they went for Tornado. They did because almost every recent ETH hacker used tornado to wash hacked money. If they would have used Aztec instead, they would have sanctioned that.","The smart contracts are still up and running. Money is still pouring in and out. This has only prevented the average user that relies on the UI from using the protocol.

Any programmer that is competent enough to hack smart-contracts does not need (or does not use) the UI since this is only an additional vector for identification.

In the same way that the 75k$ frozen by Circle could be anyone's and would have been frozen before if they could be identified as stolen money. Furthermore any hacker would know that you'd never keep stolen funds in USDC since it is administered and centralized.

This is not an attack on criminal funds, this is an attack on user anonymity. The only reason Monero is not yet under the ban hammer is because it's a much harder target with 0 dapps.

At the moment if you're a US user you've just been denied access to solid anonymity on the biggest smart-contract blockchain. They want to track users, they know this changes nothing for hackers and businesses."

This is not correct. The very first block created after TTD has been hit is produced with PoS consensus.

Finalization of the epoch that block is in can take 2-3 epochs assuming a supermajority of validators made the transition to PoS, and “however long it takes” if they didn’t. That’s part of how Ethereum PoS works and is a work of art: It stays live below 2/3rd with Ghost and finalizes above 2/3rd with Casper. Having two parts to the PoS protocol makes this possible.

They’re just chunks of code which can do whatever you want them to do. Solidity, which is the language that Ethereum smart contracts use, is a bit like JavaScript. 

We use smart contracts on Ethereum to run the logic for our game instead of running it on a cloud provider like AWS.","So I self taught solidity during covid lockdowns and going down that rabbit hole taught me the fascinating mechanics. Jpeg NFTs are simply the first novel application of a ridiculously promising tech:

-token gating: lock down certain areas of your website or access to purchase certain items by requiring web3 wallet injection (MetaMask chrome extension most common) to authenticate ownership of an ERC-721 or 1155 token before allowing access. Also works for locking down access to community discord channels. 

-burnable: you as the dev can structure out token burning rules at either a time or transaction level. An example would be if an e-comm site created a VIP rewards token that allowed you access to reduced pricing or exclusive access to new products; you could program it to self destruct/burn after either say 1 year of ownership or if the holders wallet does not meet a minimum transaction volume criteria in a certain time frame.

-Airdrops: as a digital marketing analytics department head as my job, it is tough interacting with your most loyal companies across multiple devices, emails, and phone numbers, so in the case of a VIP rewards NFT (which is held in their ethereum or L2 wallet which presumably they have used to transact with you before) you can easily “airdrop” tokens (discount coupon NFTs for transactions etc.) or ERC-20 coins (holding an ENS domain gave me a nice airdrop of the ENS token when it launched) which for a digital marketer is like being able to send a customer a message/offer right to their bank account instead of a useless burner email address. 

-voting/governance: a newly recognized form of corporation much like an LLC is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization; now legally recognized in states like Delaware) and equity/governance tokens can be distributed to owners or bought by public individuals wishing to own part of the company (if you allow it) and votes on company decisions can be easily carried out by granting # of votes to individuals based on shares/tokens held, etc. 

You can also make your tokens transferable or not, and many other useful mechanics. OpenZeppelin has great documentation on functionality and I leaned heavily on their contract wizard to get my bearings coding solidity"

Why do you say that? A dishonest player needs to deceive the userbase into going along with it, an honest player has truth on their side. Either could still convince the userbase to side with them, sure, but I don't see why the dishonest player would have an easier time of it.","I mean, yeah- if you want to fork the chain you can. You can also do that under PoW. 

The difference is that under PoS, you can also prevent the other fork from coming back to influence *your* fork. Under PoW, you have to change hashing algorithms which also destroys the security you get from the honest party. This was illustrated with the ETH/ETC split- ETH was supported by more of the community and ended up with more hashpower and was therefore more secure. ETC didn't, and suffered many 51% attacks because of it.",">Remember, any attack against a dishonest player works even better against an honest one.

That's completely wrong. You're missing the fact that this defense mechanism is just a way to ensure people remember they have self-sovereignty and that no one can force them to go along with a chain they dislike.

If consensus actors attack the chain by censoring transactions, it's a proven attack. Each user then chooses whether they accept such attack or they decide to fork attackers away.

As such, it's a defense that works whatever the people, honest or dishonest.

It's just that dishonest ones would want to force interactions with others and power over others while honest ones just want to be left alone. There's nothing that can prevent this."

How to represent systems like Lido and Rocketpool that have many stakers, but some common governance and incentive structures. And then recognize that even if there are 20 or whatever stakers in Lido, there are 96,000 different claims on those tokens.

And I also think representing each entity as ""one"" unit is just disingenuous in general. Coinbase for example has a large staking share, but they are legally the custodian for a huge number of individuals within that share... and the corporate staking they run has claims by their shareholders. All the staking services are in similar situations. Similarly with Marathon and Riot - which are US public companies mining Bitcoin... they legally represent a huge number of shareholders. 

The reality is that for both Ethereum and Bitcoin, the past few years have seen the number of entities/people participating in the consensus explode into the hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions. IMO these kind of abstract charts are ridiculously under-representative of the actual current ""distribution"" for blockchain consensus.","I like that great big ""unknown"" block.

With approximately ~13M ETH being staked, currently, aka ~406k validators, you'd need to at least match that, for a delay of more than ~450 days, assuming somehow no one else also tries to enter during all this time. 

You can probably increase the wait, easily, due to other people who will want to participate too, even more so when considering that you also need a validator for each other new validator participating. So, probably ~600 days. 

Once the delay is over, the attacker can launch the attack, after which the network responds by forking away all the tokens of all its validators, meaning they would get no one buying their huge bags of staked tokens on their own chain. It's way more than 13M of ETH being lost by the attacker in the attack. At current market price, it would be billions of dollars lost, but buying so many ETH would drive the price so far it would obviously cost way, way more than that, if there are enough tokens available for sale. 

Once the chain has forked out the attacker, it continues as before, having at most experienced a temporary network instability, ready to handle any new attack.","- establish a world government
- make a law there at least 51% had to be owned by world government
- tada: finished; shouldn’t take longer than a week or two
- /s","You can see on the chart here how many validators can join per day depending on how much ETH is staked: https://hackmd.io/@ghosts0301/rkmOjqY7t

Of course the attacker most likely won't be the only person joining the queue, so it's going to require some additional time.

You also have to consider that there isn't an infinite amount of ETH available to be bought on exchanges, and attempting to purchase 15,000,000 ETH might prove difficult. 

>someone with A LOT of capital wanted to attack the network at a consensus level, how would it play out and what are the mechanisms to delay it?

There's no way to delay such an attack, and unless an attacker makes their intention known, you wouldn't know until they actually try to attack the network.

It is a decentralised app that works with a smart contract to stake your ETH without giving it to any centralised entity or node operator. From [https://rocketpool.net/](https://rocketpool.net/) ""Open source, audited smart contracts ensure funds are never in the custody of node operators.""

From their [explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd): node operators on rocket pool stake 16ETH (instead of the usual 32ETH). Then for everyone else staking on rocket pool and not validating, all the ETH is pooled together. This pool is then used to complete the 16ETH from a validator with 16ETH from the pool to reach the 32ETH for a ""normal"" Ethereum pool. This full node is then put online on the actual Ethereum network.

All of this us done through smart contracts in a decentralised manner. So as far as the smart contracts are well coded, your crypto is safe and not under anyone else's custody.

Moving from PoW to PoS only replaces the proof, aka what's used to determine the consensus voting power distribution. 

With PoW, consensus actors have power distributed depending on the proportion of hashes they generate over time, compared to other consensus actors. 

With PoS, consensus actors have power distributed depending on the proportion of validators they maintain over time with at least 32 ETH per validator, compared to other consensus actors.

The only tiny difference of scarcity is that block time of PoS will become deterministic while PoW block time is probabilistic. With PoW, we had ~13s. With PoS, we will have exactly 12s. 

So, blockspace will be a tiny bit less scarce with PoS, meaning more L1 transactions will be able to be computed. But it won't be noticeable anyway, as has been shown by the London hard fork, which had similar blockspace increases completely hidden by the hugely increased demand for blockspace.

Edit: your question should be ""Is PoS making block space more scarce, less scarce or just as scarce?"" Here, it looks like a loaded question, because it makes an unchecked assumption (which proves to be a false assumption). Try to avoid that in general.","Generally, Ethereum is working towards higher transaction throughput (so, basically more block space, though most of it will live in roll-ups).

This has nothing to do with PoW vs PoS though?","Block limits are same under PoS and PoW - so we aren't making the block space any more scarce than it is right now. 

There are plans to create special type of data that wont be available to EVM which will be cheaper, but if anything, this makes block space less scarce due to efficiency of rollup scaling"

8/28/2022,x00lk5,0,/r/ethereum/comments/x00lk5/whats_the_purpose_of_the_difficulty_bomb_after/,1,ethereum,Whatâ€™s the purpose of the difficulty bomb after the merge?,"There will be no difficulty bomb for PoS. It's only a concept that is valid for PoW. 

Its use is to ensure that no one can scam other people into thinking they're using a maintained network when they're not. By implementing the time bomb, it forces anyone who wants to use any other branch of forks to first maintain the chain themselves rather than just profit from others and ripe the fruits of their scams.",">I thought the difficulty bomb was there to force miners to stop mining progressively

Hm, not quite. It has multiple effects, but I think the most important one is that it's prevents lazy forks. If you fork Ethereum you will have to coordinate to remove the bomb. Otherwise your fork will become unusable. So miners can definitely fork Ethereum to create a fork where proof of work is still the consensus mechanism, but they can't be lazy and just use the existing Ethereum software as it is. They need to do their own fork in order to remove the bomb.

So the difficulty bomb doesn't quite force the miners to stop mining, but it does force them to put effort into a potential fork.

The other thing, the difficulty bomb does is forcing the need to do hard forks. Which is useful because the Ethereum developers can then put new features into the hard fork that we need to do anyway.

>and after the merge there would be some sort of hybrid POS-POW system.

We'll just have proof of stake. No more proof of work after the Merge.

>But now I’m reading that after the merge, September 15 aprox., all validations will be POS, and the difficulty bomb will start exploding only 2 days before aprox., but the bomb is very progressive, and it would not have any noticeable effect.

Yes, the bomb doesn't just go off at one moment in time. It's more like a slow ramp-up. It makes the Ethereum chain have longer and longer block times until the chain becomes basically unusable.

>So at this moment I’m wondering, what’s the purpose right now of the bomb? Did it have one but now with all the delays it has none?

Still the same purpose as always.",The difficulty bomb Was in place to incentivize the developers to keep pace with the transition timeline to proof of stake.  The timeline was moved several times so was never a real threat since the developers were the one controlling. ETH  Consensus mechanism will be proof of stake. It will still be ETH. You may see a fork with a new block that will be mined proof of work.   Is similar to etherium classic ETC and will bring some other ET?? Online. The hash rate or difficulty to solve the cryptographic  puzzles will probably be the same as today

And that's also why it's a gas limit. 

So, you don't pay for whatever isn't consumed, even if you provide a higher gas limit (which is highly recommended if you don't want to run the risk of having an out of gas error). And you only pay it at the gas price of the block, even if you provide a higher max gas price.

Edit: in the wallet client, you see it as funds deduced and then returned back only because the wallet client prevents you in the UI from using those funds that may be spent by your pending transaction, so that you don't risk to create a transaction you may be unable to pay for.

Ganas is a wallet built by volunteers, for the Cosmos and EVM multi-chain ecosystem, providing tools for gaining or maintaining freedom, fairness, and transparency, for the next-generation decentralized citizen.

  
Today you will see the identities and chat feature. Users are allowed multiple basic identities. A basic identity comes with a wallet that can have multiple account addresses. You can set the chains on which each identity will exist. And ganas makes sure that identity hygiene is kept across chains and applications.

  
Each identity has its own corresponding chat account. And the chat can be used to share deep links and links with data preparations. You can share dApps and forms preset with values, that can be used for invoicing and contract partition. So, you can collaborate and build forms, contracts, or showcase dApps, from the chat. And I will show you a demo of this concept.

  
I have here a chat between two users. Each of them is using a basic, semi-anonymous identity. The user on the iPad, wants to share a prefilled dapp with the user on the iPhone. It is a simple storage decentralized application. We enter edit mode, we fill in a value, and then export the new form and we can copy the url by clicking the QR code or click a button to navigate to the exported url. And then use the export page to share the url with the current chat.

  
We send the link and now the other user can click on it. And see the form with the prefilled data - the value of 555.

  
From tools for proving time and space to document notarization and more, ganas needs to be flexible and extensible, even by its users.  
You are welcome to join us as volunteers and/or to come and test ganas on iOS and Android (link in the video description).",

PoS has lots of good properties, which is why it has been decided since Ethereum's birth that it would become PoS.

The best property is that it provides a very high security, without any economy of scale, and with L1 consensus actors being subjected to the L0 consensus. 

The second best property is it's dirt cheap to maintain.

Now that we're soon using it, I guess we could at some point choose another, better proof, since I'm sure we'll discover better ones in the future.

It does. But you're entitled to reframe definitions in any way you like: definition games are inconsequential anyway. 

>the Office for Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) states that the Tornado Cash entity (essentially “organization”) is being targeted for helping launder the proceeds of cybercrimes, including more than $450 million laundered by North Korea from the proceeds of the Harmony and Nomad bridge hacks. 

This is an arbitrary ruling, as shown by the fact lots of banks regularly violate AML regulations and only get as a result to pay a fine. Arbitrary ruling is illegitimate: if arbitrary ruling was legitimate, we wouldn't need any law to begin with. And very justifyingly, it was the biggest concern people had about how monarchies were ruling in countries where it got challenged during democratic revolutions. 

For this ruling not to be arbitrary, all US citizens should be forbidden to deal with any bank which has ever been found to violate AML regulations. That's the very minimum standard to expect for this ruling not to be arbitrary ruling and, therefore, completely illegitimate. 

>Although Github did in fact remove Tornado Cash’s repo, it did so not because the code was banned, but because providing services such as code hosting to sanctioned parties is forbidden.

Inconsistent with the rest of the article. Github doesn't host the smart contract address. It only hosts the source code. So, either the source code was sanctionned and Github indeed was forced to censor the account or the account wasn't a sanctionned party to begin with. So, which is it?

>Tornado Cash and other mixers seek to address this problem by allowing users to “pool” their funds together in a common liquidity pool

Demonstrably false. Deploy Tornado Cash by changing ETH to any non fungible token and you will see people will only ever receive exactly the tokens they've put in it. This serves as a demonstration no token is pooled with any token of anyone else: you receive exactly the tokens you put in it and never touch any token from anyone else.

>As “money laundering” is defined as “the concealment of the origins of illegally obtained money”, Tornado Cash is also textbook money laundering if the money put in is illegal in origin.

Just as much as taking items from someone else is theft if you've taken it without consent. The problem is violation of consent, not the fact of having taken an item. What was the point, exactly?

>From a pragmatic standpoint, if for example hacked bridge funds are moved immediately to a mixer, it may not be possible to identify the organization responsible since all money movements beyond the mixer are obscured.

Irrelevant. The fact lawmakers try to create unenforceable laws is their concern, not the concern of anyone else. They could also create laws forbidding fire to burn buildings and people. We won't just make it all seem as if it was enforceable. 

>Considering another option, why not limit access only for bad actors rather than for everyone? Though it’s clearly possible to limit the access of bad actors to decentralized tools to some degree (e.g. via address blacklists), this won’t work 100% of the time.

Again with another ""pragmatic"" take. Ok, since it seems to be perceived as important, let's talk about the actually pragmatic take. The sanction did literally nothing to prevent criminals from laundering money. Nothing. The contract still is entirely accessible. All it did was preventing some law-abiding citizens from accessing a service providing for their very important privacy needs. 

As such, from a pragmatic standpoint, not only the sanction was a net negative but, on top of that, it provided literally no positive. What you're defending precisely is a few politicians burning wealth and shooting in the foot of their own citizens. That's the pragmatic standpoint.

>This percentage of illicit activity is almost certainly higher than levels for common payment channels (e.g. cash, bank transfers) or communication tools (e.g. encrypted messaging, email, etc) frequently raised as comparisons.

Source? I'm pretty sure it's the very opposite, as is seen by lots of phone scams, bank refunds and even banks themselves regularly violating AML regulations, so regularly they get fined on a yearly basis. And that's, on top of all, in a very opaque system compared to a very transparent one. Expect actual numbers of AML violations from banks to be much higher than that. 

>Even if a smart contract is deployed with no pre-built controls, it’s not clear this removes all responsibility from the developer as it is “unstoppable” then only by the developer’s choice.

The thing is it is completely lawful when the action is done and there's no way to stop it once it's considered illegal. Retroactively claiming it's illegal and should be punished is illegitimate. Or are we to expect politicians will consider every past of your actions as illegal after the facts? That's clearly not how the law works.

>If someone deliberately pushed a boulder down a hill onto an innocent bystander, the fact the rolling boulder couldn’t be stopped wouldn’t excuse their decision.

If it's a very big boulder slowly going to a path that will destroy a tree, and that pushing the boulder wasn't illegal when it was pushed, then it is legal. If, at some point after the fact, it is decided destroying such sacred tree is illegal, then it can't be retroactively applied to the boulder that has been pushed, even though the boulder hasn't yet reached destination and destroyed the tree.

>Even if Coin Center’s “lack of control” argument satisfies the letter of laws around sanctions, it could be perceived as relying mostly on a loophole.

If you consider arbitrary application of law retroactively as a ""loophole"", I guess you're going to defend dictatorship, since there's literally no difference.

>As regulations for emerging tech can often require several tries to get right, the government could pass a law clarifying that organizations can be sanctioned or punished for deploying fully autonomous smart contracts, or simply give OFAC the additional authority to block smart contract access, whether using sanctions or newly introduced tools.

Maybe you haven't understood the very fact that a censorship-resistant tool isn't meant to be coerced. Be it by a group of thugs or by a state. That's a very important point, because it's how you can ensure there will always be tools available to protect the self-sovereignty of people over their data, their communication and their finances, three needs that are extremely important to provide in a censorship-resistant way, to ensure no wannabe dictator can easily attack political opponents. Don't give to dictators an even easier life.

>What if communities pass laws saying, “you must abide by our community agreement or lose your stake (money) and self-sovereign identity”?

First, you can't lose your self-sovereign identity. Otherwise, it's not a self-sovereign identity to begin with, because it's simply not mechanically designed as such.

Second, the very difference between a blockchain community and a country specifically is about self-sovereignty: first, you can always create more blockchain communities and compete with existing ones; second, you can always enforce your freedom of association.

>For the future however, effective regulation and cooperation with governments can build credibility with and increase adoption by the general public, many of whom today view crypto as a “scam”.

It's literally the other way around: removing censorship-resistance would destroy credibility and transform it into tradfi.

Besides, it would remove a powerful tool ensuring there are ways to prevent the worst from becoming a huge threat. After all, it's not governments in themselves that are a threat. Rather, it's their misuse and exploitation by malevolent people, notably wannabe dictators, at the expense of everyone else.

>Implement regulations as high in the “stack” as possible

That's called a CBDC. To be clear, if any crypto implements that, that means a fork from which will be the birth of a CBDC, in one branch, and a crypto in the other branch, the one that hasn't been changed. 

>At the bottom layer, the “immutable database” layer is designed intentionally to be difficult to modify since it provides the security and reliability on which higher layers depend.

Ah, now you see why it's useless to implement regulation ""as high as possible"".

>while finding ways to leverage technological flexibility higher in the stack to create room for governments and blockchains to co-exist peacefully.

That's not the point, at all.","tldr; The US Treasury Department has sanctioned Tornado Cash for helping to launder the proceeds of cybercrimes, including more than $450 million laundered by North Korea from proceeds of the Harmony and Nomad bridge hacks. OFAC’s decision to sanction Tornado Cash has generated strong concern from the community as a perceived attack on censorship resistance and privacy. However, the only thing sanctioned was a smart contract deployed at a specific address, and the underlying code was not sanctioned.

The popularity of the NFT has overshadowed what I believe to be a much bigger milestone in the fight to bring crypto to the masses, the monetization of upvotes/karma.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*","If you want it to work, you need to provide that token as a way to model an actually scarce resource.

And here, the scarce resource you could model is about post position in a post ordering list. As such, when you post, you can either do it freely and be last in that list or spend tokens to come higher. Then, you can be given tokens by people depending on the relevance of your post. As such, you can pay for the advertisement of being first in the list, to ensure more people view your post, because you believe lots of people will find it useful enough to notify it as relevant and give tokens to you. 

But by posting anywhere except at the last position, you push some people away from where they were. So, you could handle that by actually staking tokens rather than spending them. And then, staked tokens are regularly spent depending on how high the post is in the list. Until it's spent too much and becomes much cheaper to outcompete them with another post. 

That's the spending part of the tokenomics, revolving around a scarce resource. 

Then, you can model the issuance part. Well, the issuance could be done by another token or the same token being staked to generate more tokens or anything to provide more tokens over time to people providing a service. Now as to what service to provide, that is a good question. Ideally, nothing tied to Karma, due to its very easy manipulation. Just being a Reddit viewer, as some sort of consumer? More than that? It's the half I'm struggling with.

Interestingly enough, this at least means it can be either handled by Reddit or any front end parsing Reddit posts and showing them in any order. So, technically, being a viewer looking at advertisements (if there's nothing else that can be done to monetize it) is a service provided to the front end and that could ensure there's a service and there are tokens users could earn, at the very least.",

I explore an important question that will determine its fate: United Interchain or Disunited Interchain?,">We find no other topic of more importance or exigency than the preservation of the Interchain, thus the continuance of freedom from central tyranny. The consequence of our decisions today will last for generations.

Cool. 

>It is ingrained in the functioning of popular government that the people should decide the fate of the social contract they willingly entered. 

As long as it's done in a way that always preserves consent and freedom of association, sure. 

>As such, it would be careless not to mention that there will be violent protesters to the very notion of Union.

As long as you're not disregarding their consent, there's no reason to have violent protesters. 

>Be wary of factions that try to persuade us one way or another by utilizing loud actions and bitter criticism to coax us into the justness of their agendas. 

You mean, like what you're doing? It's good to be honest, at least. 

>Our passion for a decentralized central authority that will sustain a fair, just, and thereby free Interchain for all will be denounced by chains or individuals that, out of fear or misguidance or ignorance, by their mere conviction, endorse a system of Disunion that is hostile to the principles of liberty.

A decentralized central authority? Would you possibly explain that? If it's central authority, it can't be decentralized: a central authority by design renegates any concept of consent or freedom of association. 

Besides, how can a system of disunion be hostile to liberty in the first place, exactly? 

>Undoubtedly there will be objections to the very thought of a centralized decentralized entity. 

Color me surprised. /s 

Maybe because you'd have yet to explain how a centralized entity can be decentralized. Or are you going to try and redefine the concept of decentralization coming from game theory in order to reframe it and support an attempt to actually create a centralized one? 

>Are these objects not the same protests that were made at the formalizing of the American Constitution?

You mean, the same Constitution that failed to prevent the US from becoming what it nowadays is? You'd want to reproduce that? Why? You already have the US. If you're so much a fan of it, you can already get there. 

>The current situation is as dire as the one presented to America when their time came to answer Union or Disunion, when their time came to ratify the constitution, and when their time came to decide between liberty or tyranny.

Yep. And they chose to create the Constitution that didn't prevent tyranny. So, yeah, no, thanks. 

>If Union is not chosen, we, like the states before the constitution, will be left in a miserable shape of disrepair. If we are unwilling to trust the authorities which will raise the interchain high we’ll deteriorate into the depths. We must have the courage and optimism to build a new system.

You mean, the Constitution that produced a government that ensured the US becomes what it is today, or either didn't prevented it to become what it is today, and that's something you want to reproduce on chain? No, thanks, again.

What you need is freedom of association. A union can only be good if it allows anyone to exist outside of it without unconsentfully coercing or harming outsiders. Otherwise, it's not a union, it's a state, with all its centralized authority ruling over unconsenting people, aka slaves of sort.

>The strength of government is essential to the security of liberty

Not an argument, just a claim. Support your claims.

>freedom is vital to the functioning of popular governments

Sure. And a monopoly of unconsented coercion necessarily goes against that. Try again.

>Popular systems depend on liberty to function, thereby, government and liberty are aligned.

Unsupported claim again, that you use to conclude governments and liberty are aligned, despite all examples existing that contradict your conclusion.

>The primary fallacious argument deployed against United Interchain construction is that it poses threat to individual chain sovereignty and, by which, tyranny over the population.

You failed to show how it is a fallacy. That is an unsupported claim again.

>The United Interchain government’s objectives will be

Objectives? You mean, like official goals that states have and that are disregarded on a regular basis? No one cares for objectives. Objectives are wishful thinking fallacies, as is demonstrated by so many agencies blatantly going against their objectives.

>We ask why, if it were the majority of the Interchains resolution to form a Union, would we implement a system that would allow tyranny?

How a majority would be tyranny? Well, let's be clear: it's two wolves and a sheep voting for what's on dinner tonight. No thanks, I don't want to be eaten like everyone else before.

>If we choose the latter, anarchy will ensue.

Anarchy, aka the lack of rulers over unconsenting people. It's literally what you're claiming to support and yet what you're also saying should be avoided. That is not only disingenuous, but also lacking rhetoric skills to avoid making fallacies over fallacies. Impressive lack of quality. The worst is that a few people will believe you just because you use nice enough words. Despicable.

>All we hold dear to our hearts and all we dream for the Interchain will be just that: a dream. We would wonder eternally how high the Interchain could have soared if its wings were not clipped.

Clipped by the lack of a sovereign preventing self-sovereignty? Well, let's ""clip"" these wings, then, so that we stop being imprisoned.

>We’re not going to promise the United Interchain will be different, and we’re certain that many have made that promise before.

Lol, ok, so you're literally saying we'd most probably have a US 2.0. And that you're ok with it. Nice. At least some honesty. XD

The name difficulty bomb was a very poor choice. Because instead of going off in an instant it increases exponentially over time. In the beginning it is very subtle and very hard to notice, but increases more and more over time. You only notice it when you chart the average block time over a longer period of time. Like here:  

https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime

In the chart you can see that it was pushed back in June and is now slowly increasing the block time, but it will not have any significant effect on the Merge.","The difficulty bomb is not relevant in that sense that there will be a complete switchover on Merge day. There will not be some stakers/validators and the miners still keep mining until they are killed off by the difficulty bomb or something like this.

One last block is mined through PoW that hits the TTD and then it will be only PoS.

The difficulty bomb is just in place to disincentivize the creation of a forked Ethereum because miners are too lazy and just keep their rigs running. If they try or sleep through the Merge, then that network will collapse soon through the difficulty bomb.

However, some miners have stated they WANT to create a fork that remains PoW (just because they don't want to change their business model). That fork requires software changes (minimum to remove the bomb) and all node operators must actively change to the newly forked chain.","Wait, are you sure about that?

If you do manually access ETHPOW send your ETH out first to another wallet to mitigate from a replay attack, since the miners set their new chain up in a scammy way that doesn't differentiate their network from ETH's.

If it's on an exchange then dont worry about the replay attack, consider it a bonus and sell it if you'd like.","If you want do do anything with this ethpow, make sure to send your normal eth to another address of yours.

So, to me, it's a non problem of a user who's grown accustomed to pay for hidden costs.

Its goal, as described by the EF, is to replace centralized third-parties by decentralized third-parties. 

It means the entire economic activity is organized in an organic way, rather than a centralized way. For most tiny companies, it won't change much internally. It's for big corporations that it will change the most.

Many mid-level management positions will become redundant, as structures shrink through the push of competition and as more and more business logic gets implemented as provable behaviors. 

Large-scale coordination between several small platforms or groups will be eased, allowing entire districts can decide for their own building maintenance without the need for a state or a corporation to intervene. 

Easier and more powerful tools and labels will become available to ensure people can filter out the garbage to better access the signal they're looking for (ensuring they don't fall for scams or such). At the extreme level, just as much as good enough public bounties ensure black hats work for the ecosystem rather than against it, these tools and labels will ensure scams will look closer and closer to actual products, until the point scammers actually become product providers, due to how easier it has become to bring a product instead of creating a successful scam. 

All small-scale inefficiencies of coordination will be smoothed away, with an increasing trend in Airbnb, Über and similar concepts (apps to minimize food waste between neighbors, to maximize tool utility, to transports products during already planned trips and so on and so forth), without a centralized platform taking an unreasonable cut. Rather, it would be decentralized platforms competing with each others and offering competitive prices with competitive cuts.

Just like in Brooklyn, blockchain-managed electrical microgrids will become the norm, ensuring electricity is produced and consumed nearly at its real time cost, incentivizing complex individualist decisions to spare the most harmful consumption trends and reduce spike effects of centralization. 

Centralized banks will have to compete and provide actual, market checked products and trustless proofs rather than trustful interactions. Just as much as the other corporations, they will be split into smaller units using on-chain insurance to prevent problems. They will also be more or less replaced by decentralized versions of themselves, a bit like some USDT where each individual can participate into stablecoin token minting through a proof of owning an asset. 

DAO types will split into several sub systems, ones where user participation has an explicitely implemented recognition, be it at the same level or higher than token staking; ones where DAOs will collectivize no owning and will only allow to temporarily delegate assets, that are still fully owned by and tied to their original owners (which would allow easy split of DAOs and remove any vulnerability of the voting process).

Anonymous, decentralized data storage will become easy and keep being cheap, allowing some people to specialize their hardware to accommodate the world's demand for data storage. This also brings privacy-friendly data self-sovereignty. 

Coupled with censorship-resistant transaction systems and censorship resistant communications, it ensures no wannabe dictator has an easy life clicking on a button to attack their political opponents. 

Decentralized identity sovereignty will ensure no state or coercive group (notably, human traffickers) can prevent people from proving their identity. 

Decentralized data computation, federated AI learning and provable AI code can bring to individuals the benefits of big data analysis, without sacrificing data privacy. This means a much better profit from data without depending on a few corporation taking most of the profit for themselves.

I probably missed many others.","Etherum is not decentralized, that's why most Etheruam 39-40 percent is owned by 100 wallets and those 100 wallets can still be owned by the same entity just with multiple addresses.","Using it for what?

One of the main reasons for having gas (at variable rates, set by an auction model) is to make it prohibitively expensive to carry out the DOS attack you're describing.  (And it *is* just a DOS attack on the Ethereum network.)",">prank TX is executed at 90,000 per second, how can it be prevented? 

In a permissionless system, you can't. If you have a mechanism that detects and censors spam, that's still censorship - and we want censorship resistance. So really the ability to pay is the only criterion for whether or not a transaction should be able to make it through. 

EIP1559 keeps this system but automatically adjusts the minimum fee to (on average) always have extra space in blocks. Whether the network is being spammed with spam transactions or it's genuine activity from real people, the end result is the same: You pay for the resources you use. If you really want to DoS you'll have to keep up with the exponentially increasing fee, and since that fee gets burned you have no way of gaming it.

>it can happen only on Geth P2P 

and there's p2p layer protection against DoS attacks, such as node refusing to broadcast transactions with a low fee. I'm pretty sure if today the basefee somehow fell to the weis, there's still a minimum imposed priority fee of 1 gwei to keep things from getting out of hand. (This happened on Polygon when nodes upped the minimum to 30 gwei to deal with spam, even after implementing eip1559 the minimum priority fee is still 30 gwei even when the base fee is 7 wei)

Likewise to rebroadcast a new transaction with the same nonce, nodes will only drop-and-replace when the new transaction's fee is at least 10% higher than the previous one, so that's another exponentially increasing cost if you want to spam the p2p layers with junk - at some point you will pay for it if you meet all the criteria that make nodes broadcast your transaction

>is L2 preparing a security code that can ""preliminarily"" distinguish between 10,000 normal TXs and 90,000 abnormal TXs?

Layer 2 is a whole different game! And it's not a ""monolithic"" thing that will enforce one specific solution, different L2s will have different models depending on what they want to do. Some might have minimum enforced fees, some might have per-user throttles, some might do some kind of sophisticated spam detection and censorship. *Some* censorship on L2 is tolerable, as long as there's the censorship resistant escape hatch - if you get wrongly censored, you just use it and yeet your funds and in the end it's the rollup that suffers. As everything in the space, competition drives innovation

tl;dr This is the ""transaction quality trilemma"", you can only pick 2 of those 3: Censorship resistance, low fees, no spam. L1 has the first and third, L2 can get away with second and third or try different mitigation technique to get closest possible to all 3

>In this situation, the gas cost will be 1wei

*ackshually* the minimum is 7 wei because it's all integer-based math under the hood","Are you just asking how rollups will handle potential spam attacks?

It's an open question of sorts, since at the moment transactions are still too expensive for spam to be effective. The simplest option might be to simply have a gas market that is highly responsive to large spikes in demand, but overall tolerant of ""normal"" amounts of high throughput. Other rollups may opt for web2-style defenses, where spammed transactions are simply identified and dropped from the mempool without being processed. 

Really it depends on what said rollup (or sidechain/validium/volition/optimistic chain) is trying to accomplish. Do they want credible neutrality? If so, a fine-tuned gas market may be preferable. Do they just want cheap fees for users without worrying about TX censorship? Web2-style options might be preferable."

you'd have to log in with soulbound NFT but with zero knowledge tech   
so that privacy is ensured in public blockchain

then if there's an unlawful transaction going on, authorities can find it out themselves who that is w/o asking middleman as there is none in truly decentralized system

i'm sure they can block someone from interacting with DeFi further that way

so i think authorities will have to register people with soulbound NFT and   
web3 devs just have to make sure double check only registered soulbound NFT can interact with their apps/etc

basically nobody should have full knowledge of what each person does what  
but what happens should be open to public anonymously  
only reverse traced to find identity/sanction when there's an incident that goes against the law or something

but then it's digital so who has jurisdiction over control of identity/transaction  
i guess jurisdiction goes to the right authority when the transaction occurs physically in their country...or AI if international

Where are pro-crypto advocates directing regulators to focus on frontends/devs? What would it look like to be framing the issue as about validators, and would that really actually be better if regulators were mainly trying to force protocol level censorship?

Force is necessary to ensure a TX system works, everyone must use it with no way to opt-out.",WTF did I just read...,">Naturally, TX, which is fast in time, should be included in the chain first.

Naturally? Why?

>What would the world be like if banks handled transactions in the order of payment of fees rather than in the order of time when the transactions occurred? It'll be a mess.

I agree, because banks are centralized. Here, you're trying to cater to the disadvantages of the banking system in a system that doesn't have such disadvantages. It's self-defeating in purpose. 

>Of course, there may be computer problems or other exceptional situations. 

Which have proven not to happen in crypto, fortunately.

>However, not in this exceptional case, everyone would agree that the world's economy would be messed up if the transaction order was generally set on a commission basis.

I don't. Devs who implemented this mechanism don't either, very obviously. So, are we nobody, now? Or are you obviously wrong? Facts challenge your claim, but you never support that claim that it's ""natural"" and that it should occur however you see fit.

>If the existing blockchain is only for gambling, DeFi, money laundering, P2E, and tax evasion, it is okay to set TX's chain entry ranking based on fees. However, in the operation of the blockchain, for example, if you want Ethereum to be used in general retail transactions, that is, in order for Ethereum to have a status of card, the atmosphere will now change. In principle, TXs should be accepted in chronological order.

First, there is no chronological order due to decentralization. Any chronological order would imply a DoS attack is possible to the source of truth of that chronology, destroying your network system. 

Second, you're putting yourself as a judge of what transactions should be, here. Gambling, DeFi and whatever else has its place, because it's the right of any user. Who are you to judge them? It's a network no one owns. You're not at home owning it and deciding about it, here.

Frankly, if you want to have your own crypto without decentralization, be my guest and create another one. Fork Ethereum and redo it all to remove the concept of blocks, the concept of decentralization, everything. And people will use it if they consider it's useful. Each individual will decide for oneself.

>The only problem in this scene was, at a particular moment, how to identify the TX that was created first or provided the highest commission.

>This is impossible. It is impossible not only practically but also theoretically.

And fortunately not required at all, since it's each consensus actor individually deciding what transaction to put into the chain. They are incentivized by transaction fees, but a consensus actor who would graciously decide to instead include transactions paying less but having been in the mempool for probably longer could do so. No one prevents them.

>His decentralization was too excessive.

Either it's decentralized enough to be censorship-resistant or it's not decentralized enough and completely useless. This is because anything that isn't censorship-resistant will necessarily be coerced by governments to be just like tradfi, ensuring the whole concept becomes completely useless. This is what Satoshi knows and what you don't.

>But now decentralization has become a religion called the emperor's new clothes and people are praising the invisible clothes of the emperor.

You call religion people who have solid arguments about their claims, when you don't. That's what religious people do all the time. Hence why so many religious people call science a religion. It's just projection, here, and a way to ensure you never challenge your own beliefs.

>There are countless ways to centralize any one of the entire P2P nodes.

And any such way ensures the state can coerce the system, ensuring it's just no use building that system: a coerceable system could be designed in any way, it won't change the fact coercion can completely redesign it to fit the desired of the coercive group. What you're trying to do iwls just free work for the state. How patriotic of you.

>The idea that decentralization will bring heaven to the financial system is nothing but fantasy.

Yet it's already the case.

>Rather, it is the current situation that only tax evasion, money laundering, and gambling are thriving.

I can say the very same of the banking system, except that only big players are allowed to do that. Also, price discovery still isn't gambling, except in your own head.

>Democratic centralization without centralized power is possible.

It's still centralized and thus coerceable. And thus useless as any design achieved can be changed by any coercive group.

>Satoshi's dream was to use Bitcoin as a payment method for general transactions. But it was an impossible idea in the first place. As a ""block"" chain, that dream cannot be achieved.

Yet he succeeded. Quite impressive for an impossible idea. XD 

As a proof, it's already used. The fact you're not using it to buy your own bread at your local bakery doesn't change that. You're not either using any Euro at your local bakery, yet it doesn't change the fact Euro is a payment method for general transactions. Next time, maybe check reality before asserting claims that are so easy to spot as false."

They removed the EIP 1559 burn to instead be paid to miners (just fyi, there isn't a burn wallet in ETH for these coins normally, they are simply removed from existence. So there is no honeypot sitting there of all the burned coins). ETHW didn't take all the old burned coins, but they supposedly did stop burning from occurring going forward.

They also supposedly reassigned all the staked ETH to themselves in the PoW version. Giving themselves a huge portion of all the ETHW.

There's no difference between one DAI and the next, so there's no way to tell if one is ""backed"" and one isn't. To check that each DAI on a rollup is backed by an appropriate amount of DAI in the bridge, just check the addresses:

L1 Escrow: https://etherscan.io/address/0xA10c7CE4b876998858b1a9E12b10092229539400#tokentxns
