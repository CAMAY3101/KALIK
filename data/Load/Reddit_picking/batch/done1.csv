1569919663.0,11,7,ethereum,Discussion: Are blockchain certficates really a suitable blockchain use case?,"Hashing your certificate will provide you anonymity, and the ability to share your credentials only with trusted peers. Besides, it's not that complicated to put data on the blockchain. Don't forget that blockchain tech is just a distributed database, you can treat it as upgraded trustless mysql.    


If you go deeper into capabilities that will come with making each credential digital, you will understand my point. e.g, imagine the world where people get their blockchain identity right from the moment of birth. Afterwards, they could use it everywhere and add there some university degrees, proofs of skills, etc.",Meet in alleys and place bets on what the internal hash in?,It is completely pointless.

1569928532.0,4,46,ethereum,Gradbase putting qualifications on the Ethereum Blockchain,In my opinion I think this is a very solid use case.,"This is indeed a very good use case of Blockchain technology in general.

The qualification verification procedures of today are dire. If you wanted to verify the authenticity of a degree or work experience you would in 99.9% of cases know who/what office to contact at the issuing institution. This is before you take into account the eventual language barrier and international payment that may have to be made. Moreover, every institution uses their own method (typically slow and manual) to accept requests and fulfil them. I've seen companies not perform employee checks at all because the system is simply impossible to navigate.

This is because there is zero standardisation in this sector, and all data is stored in different siloed databases at the institution's end.

At a talk in London, UK last year, Vitalik expressed his support for using Ethereum to solve this problem, in particular to check if qualifications have been revoked. Amplifying the discourse to qualification verification in general, whatever method you decide to use technically, storing hashes or encrypted digests of qualification data on a public, robust, decentralised ledger allows every verifying body to instantly verify the validity of qualification data with the same standardised experience all over the world.

You can then start thinking about building a user-friendly mechanism to make the process easy for the lay person. In Gradbase's case, this is a QR code to be added to CV/LinkedIn, but I have seen digital certificates and mobile apps too.

I feel this application of Blockchain is fairly underrated, yet think it will ultimately come to be one of those that will survive all hypes and march on long into the future. Only time will tell; in the meantime I wish all the companies in this particular field the very best of luck.",So is TiiQu [https://tiiqu.com/blockchain-based-certification/](https://tiiqu.com/blockchain-based-certification/) .

1569942139.0,11,17,ethereum,How to open a loan on Maker,Can someone explain why I would put a 150% collateral in ETH to get DAI when I could just buy DAI and not pay interest?,"i love the break down of how to setup a CDP, the benefits and risks involved. This actually makes Nexo feel better at this moment: you can only get a loan for 50% of the value of your ETH, so $2000 worth of ETH is needed for a $1000 loan. The market would then need to drop by 50% for your ETH to get liquidated. This is really safe imo, and safer than the CDP ( though i bet you can add more ETH into the CDP and just not take out the entire value into a loan of DAI ). on Nexo the interest is just 8% if you pay with Nexo tokens, and the tokens themselves can be used to reduce the chance of your position being liquidated, while also providing a dividend! However , in the future if your interest rate on a $1000 loan would be something like 5% or lower, that would be pretty sick.",

1569954691.0,9,23,ethereum,"EVM Istambul storage pricing, or how to hack the EVM to spend half the gas when handling data","So, there are a couple of reasons this may not actually be a problem.

First, it's very cumbersome to use, and only works for larger chunks of data. It's not going to make sense in a lot of accounting style use cases like an ERC20 contract, a DEX contract, etc.

Second, it may actually be cheaper to store data this way. `SLOAD` gets more expensive as the size of a state trie increases, but Ethereum doesn't have just one state trie. There's one state trie that has all of the Ethereum accounts, hashes of their code, their balances, their state trie root, and a couple other values. Then, each contract has its own state trie that contains the contract code and other storage data. By the time you're executing a contract's code in the EVM you've already looked up its state root, so if SLOADS are going up overtime it's because contracts have bigger state tries of their own, not because the overall Ethereum state has grown.

So storing data in the code of a contract means you have to look up that contract in the top level state trie, then look up one value in a state trie that only has one value. You only have to navigate the state trie once, and it's a small state trie, so the lookup goes fairly quickly even if the stored value is larger.

While this seems counter-intuitive and mispriced, it actually may not be.","IstaNbul. Sorry, couldn't resist. :)

This doesn't matter for ropsten, as it's a testnet and a planned fork should be pushed so testing can be done.  
  
It's not a concern for mainnet forks, because core devs cannot compete with current hashpower to push a fork.  
  
It may be a concern for PoS. As I believe (could be wrong) that Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation still control a lot of ether.

The issue I believe is that in a voting system, you do not want people to be able to prove to someone else for whom they have voted, because this means that people can buy votes or coerce votes (in current systems, if someone pays you, you can just take the money and vote for whatever you want, and the person paying you won't be able to tell if you indeed voted what he wanted). Maybe this might be solved in the future with things like zkproofs and the like, but I am no expert.  But this is not an ""easy"" problem.","because of the security issues inherent in elections, and lack of common understanding of how to secure a private key/mobile device, I'd expect a long wait before this becomes common for national elections in developed nations. 

That said, there's a good opportunity to start building the technology for things like ""\[your country here\] Has Talent"" competitions or even corporate elections, given some regulatory maneuvering.","I’ve considered the thought since Ethereum launched.

Imo, voting on the Blockchain would require a complete overhaul of our identification systems. I always thought something like this *could* work if your SSN or state license/ID generated a private key and public address. 

Registering to vote could be a public transaction to a smart contract, in which you get a token to vote in return. Contact could be setup to freeze transactions until voting day / release tokens on voting day, or release tokens once you verify identity at the voting booths. 

Wallets could be set up for candidates. Token could be deflationary upon transfers (think bomb token), and voting for a candidate could require a minimum token amount  that’s equal to exactly 1 transaction of the token from your wallet. This way a token would be rendered useless if transferred to another person who tries voting with your issued token, as that token wouldn’t meet the minimum amount to transact. Simple UI design at the voting booths could circumvent this as well - issue token upon verification at voting booth, token is released to your wallet at voting booth, and you’re only given options to send a vote to valid candidate address. 

Only problem here is you’d have trust the government could setup a secure smart contract. And you’d have to trust private key issuance and verification has been done fairly. Government would also need to log real identities associated with public addresses, and you’d have to trust they logged that securely - vote transactions should be public so anyone could tally votes, and you cannot have the public finding out identities associated with public addresses, as who you vote for must remain private.

Totally biased answer as I'm with Argent, which was recommended below. We're a non-custodial wallet that's recreated the security features of a bank using smart contracts, including:

* Daily transfer limit (to prevent anyone being able to drain your account in the unlikely event they had access to your unlocked phone & wallet)
* No seed phrase - so no single point of failure
* Ability to lock your wallet
* Trusted contacts
* Approving large transfers

I think despite some harsh comments I think our community simply feels like a better location could have been chosen. Some of the things that will need to be considered going forward are:

1.) Considerable time needs to be spent on choosing an awesome location and venue. I mean a team needs to vet and go through all possible sites and locations and consider all aspects of the location as in housing availability, transportation, meals, broadband availability, lots of bright open spaces with a view a plus, etc.

2.) Major investment and operation towards professionally streaming live all talks, all rooms, all interviews and have it all available to view 24/7.

To ensure this, we intend to give away thousands of VDF rigs to Ethereans and beyond around the world.","Good question, I always assumed the VDF's would be ran by the validators.","Ok so it goes like this on the last reveal:

1) the last revealer has some amount of time to reveal or not. This time will be less than the theoretical fastest time to run the VDF. If they decide not to reveal or time runs out, they submit a 0 (as an example). 

2) This last bit of entropy is combined with the rest of the entropy from the commit reveal. 

3) Anyone running the VDF can begin to evaluate the final combined entropy and get a result. 

4) once submitted this can be trivially verified as correct by the validators or really anyone running a node.

1570926149.0,30,62,ethereum,Synchronous vs Asynchronous cross-shard communication,"> Nearly all DeFi will naturally get deployed wherever the Maker contracts live

I'm not so sure.

Keep in mind that most of the tokens representing our DeFi apps (e.g. DAI and the cTokens) will be pretty easily sendable across shards once the token contracts are upgraded to allow for that. So, for instance, there's no inherent reason that Maker and Compound would need to be on the same shard.

In practice, only contracts that are *tightly coupled through function calls between each other* might necessarily need to be on the same shard. Contracts that are *loosely coupled through tokens* can live on separate shards just fine, and ""communicate"" indirectly through users sending tokens cross-shard.

Imagine a theoretical flow like this:

1. User 1 draws DAI from MakerDAO, which lives on Shard A.
2. User 1 sends DAI to Shard B.
3. User 1 lends DAI on Compound, which lives on Shard B.
4. User 2 borrows DAI from Compound on Shard B.
5. User 2 sends DAI to whatever other DeFi app living on whatever other shard they want.

It all works fine cross-shard like this, no? As long as the contracts depend only on tokens and not on cross-contract calls.
