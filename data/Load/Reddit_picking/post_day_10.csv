**TLDR:**

You will be able to buy ERC20 tokens which will be redeemable for access to web apps. One token per web app. The reason to buy access to web apps with tokens instead of a credit card is the added ability to sell non-redeemed tokens if you don't want to use the app anymore or buy a lot of them at a discount and re-sell them at profit to other buyers and end-users.

Any thoughts? Does the idea excite you? Do you see any problems with it?

Also, we're looking for web apps to participate. Chat with me on Telegram: gonchs",ethereum,Tokenizing access to web apps - what are your thoughts?

This is a cryptographic money that can be exchanged for different digital forms of money or other sovereign monetary forms, much the same as BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

[Download Offline Ethereum](https://aistore2030.github.io/Ethereum-Wallet/) the time between squares is around 14 seconds, contrasted and Bitcoin's \~10 minutes. This implies overall in the event that you made a Bitcoin exchange and an Ethereum exchange, the Download Offline Ethereum exchange would be recorded into Ethereum's blockchain quicker than the Bitcoin exchange getting into Bitcoin's blockchain. You could state Bitcoin keeps in touch with its database generally at regular intervals, while Ethereum keeps in touch with its database generally like clockwork. Ethereum has littler squares In Bitcoin, the most extreme square size is indicated in bytes (right now 1 MB) though Ethereum's square size depends on multifaceted nature of agreements being run ‚Äì it's known as a Gas cutoff for each square, and the greatest can change marginally from square to square. Right now the most extreme square size in Ethereum is around 1,500,000 Gas. Essential exchanges or installments of ETH starting with one record then onto the next (ie not a savvy contract) have a multifaceted nature of 21,000 Gas so you can fit around 70 exchanges into a square (1,500,000/21,000). In Bitcoin you as of now get around 1,500-2,000 exchanges in a square. Information astute at present most Ethereum squares are under 2 KB in size. The Ethereum Virtual Machine can run keen agreements Compared with Bitcoin's crude scripting language, the code that can be sent in Ethereum and keep running as savvy agreements is further developed and natural to designers. Savvy agreement code is controlled by something many refer to as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which keeps running on the PCs of all members on the system.

 In the event that you know about Microsoft Excel macros (bits of code keep running by Excel), at that point likewise brilliant agreements are bits of code kept running by Ethereum's Virtual Machine.

&amp;#x200B;

**EthRaspbian** (ARM7) \[1\] is a custom Linux image for the **Raspberry Pi 4** \[2\] that runs **Geth** or **Parity** Ethereum clients as a boot service and automatically turns the device into a **full Ethereum node**. The image includes other components of the Ethereum ecosystem such as **Trinity, Status.im, Raiden, IPFS, Swarm and Vipnode** as well as initial support for **Eth2.0 clients**.

It also runs on the **Raspberry Pi 2/3** but due to hardware limitations these devices **are not capable of syncing the blockchain.** However, you can run **Geth** or **Parity** as **light clients** or **support the Ethereum network** by running other key software such as **Status.im, Raiden, IPFS or Swarm.**

For running a **full Ethereum node on ARM64 devices** (currently **NanoPC-T4** \[3\] and **Rockpro64** \[4\]), please see the **EthArmbian** project \[5\]

# Features

EthRaspbian Image takes care of everything, from setting up the environment to installing and running the Ethereum software as well as synchronizing the blockchain.

These are the main features:

* Based on Raspbian \[6\] **Debian Buster**
* Automatically **resizes the SD card**
* **Partitions and formats the USB SSD drive** (in case is detected) and **mount it as /home** for storing the Ethereum blockchain
* Creates an **Ethereum user account**
* **Changes the hostname** to something like ‚Äúethnode-e2a3e6fe‚Äù (HEX chunk based on MAC hash)
* Enables **SSH**
* Automatically reboots once for hostname change, new /home mount point and MicroSD resize to take effect
* **Runs Geth by default as a Systemd** service and starts syncing the Blockchain. Systemd monitors the Ethereum client binary and respawns it in case it gets killed or something unexpected happens (such as a reboot)
* Includes Parity Ethereum client as well so you can switch between both clients
* Includes other components of the Ethereum framework such as **Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm**
* Includes an **APT repository** for upgrading Ethereum packages by running **apt-get install command** (e.g. sudo apt-get install geth)

# Ethereum software installed

* Geth: 1.9.6 (official binary)
* Parity: 2.5.9 (cross compiled)
* Swarm: 0.5.2 (official binary)
* Raiden Network: 0.200.0\~rc1 (official binary)
* IPFS: 0.4.22 (official binary)
* Status.im: 0.34.0\~beta3 (cross compiled)
* Vipnode: 2.3 (official binary)

# Requirements

* Raspberry Pi 4 model B (4GB)
* Micro SD Card
* SSD disk with USB 3.0 (See USB SSD disk section)
* Power Supply
* Ethernet cable
* (Optional but strongly recommended) Case with a heatsink and a fan.
* (Optional but strongly recommended) 30303 Port forwarding
* (Optional) USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI)

# Download and install instructions

**Download Raspberry Pi 4 image**

[https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image\_2019-10-26-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image_2019-10-26-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip)

md5sum 172dd37c30e4ae734ff39b45f5e5a33c

**Flashing the MicroSD (Linux command line)**

    unzip image_2019-10-20-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip
    sudo dd bs=1M  if=2019-10-20-EthRaspbian2.0-lite of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress

Once flashed, insert de MicroSD, connect the SSD USB disk (blue port), the ethernet cable and power up the Raspberry.

**Disclaimer: Keep in mind that your entire USB disk will be wiped out.**

For further info regarding installation and usage please visit Ethereum on ARM Github page \[1\]

# USB SSD disk

There are **2 options** for the SSD storage:

Use a **USB portable SSD disk** such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD (as seen on this fantastic step-by-step guide to **run a full node on the RPi4 by Gr√©goire Jeanmart**) \[7\]

Use a **USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk**. In my case I used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011 \[8\] with a Kingston SSD A400 (480 GB) \[9\]. Be sure to buy a case with an **UAS compliant chip**, particularly, one of these: **JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E)**

Keep in mind that **you need to plug the disk to a USB 3.0 port (blue)**

# Fast Sync data

These are the numbers of the Raspberry Pi 4 Fast sync:

* Sync time: 4 days and 2 hours
* Total state entries downloaded: 391M
* Total DB size: 178 GB

# Other considerations

30303 port forwarding is a must, otherwise, the sync process will be far more slow.

Try to get a case with a fan and a heatsink to prevent CPU throttle (during sync, the temperature can go over 80 ¬∫C without a cooling system). There are lots of cases out there (like this one \[10\]).

The 2Gb model may work but you probably need to tweak Geth memory usage (I'm a little skeptical here, though). Try to reduce the --cache value in /etc/ethereum/geth.conf file. The swap memory config is in /etc/dphys-swapfile. Feel free to report here your feedback.

Take into account that fast sync depends on several factors: Disk throughput, network bandwidth, RAM memory, disk cache... so total sync time may differ between users. For the Raspberry Pi 4, expect between 3-5 days for the sync process to complete.

It seems that there may be an issue with memory management \[11\]. I got some errors during the sync process related to RAM  (though it doesn't stop the sync as systemd respawns the process). It turns out that Geth can't handle 512MB of cache in the RP4 (it is set now to 256MB) while ARM64 devices (with 4GB of RAM as well) run with more than 1GB of cache with no problem whatsoever. In you run into this, please, report here or in Github your feedback.

Finally. A few days ago, at Devcon 5, Joseph Lubin set a goal of 1M developers working on the Ethereum ecosystem by Devcon 6. If this is achievable (I think it is), can we get a fraction of these users to run a full node? It just takes a MicroSD flash...

What the Streamr devs have done is to build generic infrastructure to allow individuals to monetize their data.  As everyone knows, this infrastructure exists only for b2b data sales (think Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters). But not for individuals. If you want to sell your data, you basically have to download it all and sell it on eBay. That's where we are in 2019. This lack of infrastructure for individuals to monetize their data is the main reason we live in the Panopticon society we currently inhabit. Individuals have no property rights over their data ergo, no money, no privacy, no respect, and no power. We're all info-slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

The [Swash app](http://swashapp.io) is the first app (but by no means the only one) to be built on top of Streamr's infrastructure. Last week it got demonstrated at Mozfest.  Swash's first version is now [ available for Firefox users](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/swash/) only. (Chrome, Brave and Edge versions to follow very soon as I understand it).    


![img](6nlzu80m9fw31 ""Streamr co-founder Henri Pihkala demo-ing Swash and Data Unions at Mozfest, Oct 2019"")

So what does Swash do? Basically you can earn crypto for your browsing and social media data. Users simply install the browser plugin, customise their privacy settings and then through the Swash plugin, you (and everyone else who is a Swash operator) sends the data you choose to be aggregated, to a data firehose on [Streamr's Marketplace](https://streamr.network/marketplace). Streamr is calling this a Data Union.   


Why aggregate the data into a firehose? Because on its own, your data holds little value, but combine it with others into a Data Union and you gain strong collective power to generate revenue for each contributor and shape the future of data ecosystem. 

When that data firehose sells to buyers (all these transactions are  recorded on the  Ethereum blockchain btw) everyone gets a share of the money as distributed through a smart contract - NOT through a centralised provider. This is why the whole Streamr set up is different to projects like Wibson. It is permissionless and decentralized.  

Illustrator Maggie Appleton loved what she saw and drew this (thank you!).  

![img](b2iw77fb9fw31 ""Illustrator Maggie Appleton loved Data Unions and drew this to help explain it all."")

&amp;#x200B;

A brief mention about what going on at layer 0. Streamr's p2p Network is the underlying infrastructure empowering the data aggregation and transport for apps like Swash. In order to make it easy for any developer to create a Data Union for their users, Streamr [released their Monoplasma payment](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-scaling-tech-monoplasma-wants-to-let-dapps-broadcast-crypto) solution to handle one-to-many micropayments efficiently in Feb this year. Basically, that made it feasible for a data stream to be composed of hundreds of thousands if not millions of users whilst still enjoying the advantages offered by decentralized technologies. 

The notion of crowdselling data is new, but the implications are that it provides a step towards data ownership and better user rights. It is also a middle ground approach between blindly offering it for free to big tech in exchange for access to their services and envisioning a future where no data is shared at all. You can meet the team behind the plugin and learn more about their motivations and ambitions for Swash in this video.   


![video](ydsigpb5ffw31 ""Swash - the world's first Data Union!"")

So will Swash be Ethereum's killer app? Well mainstream conversations around data have never been more vibrant, and loathing of centralised data giants like Facebook, never greater. This app is positioning itself as a solution to many of the problems in that conversation. And because it's so easy to use from a crypto perspective - no onboarding/KYC etc - and because it actually makes you money from a legit source, it's got every chance of getting more than a few thousand users. Of course Swash (and actually Streamr's first version of their underlying infrastructure) doesn't launch until March 2020. Until that point, I'd expect to see Swash's first 50 users turn into a very healthy stream of early adopters.",ethereum,Ethereum's killer app?

1572955976,11,39,"(This is a modified exerpt from our larger article, [Building Decentralized Gateways to Crypto](https://medium.com/daihard-buidlers/building-decentralized-gateways-to-crypto-b3a1d9378c3))

## The Hard Problem

Any worldwide gateway between fiat and crypto must grapple with a particularly complex, multivariate problem:

The traditional banking system is cobbled together from a multitude of data center silos. Worse, the vast majority of the system supports reversible transactions, as a response to the unsurprisingly huge volume of fraud it sees (when you think about it, a credit card number isn‚Äôt much different from a take-as-much-money-from-me-as-you-want password. Unless you change that dynamic (as crypto has done) you better have some reversibility mechanic.)

So when you have a user in fiat banking silo A who wants to buy crypto from a user in fiat banking silo B, there are some unknowns. Is the payment possible in the first place? What are the fees going to be? How long will it take? And can the sender reverse the payment? If so, how long will be be before we can consider the payment ‚Äúfinal‚Äù?

These questions are often extremely difficult to know before actually attempting the payment, and can even remain vague after trying it once. Maybe the very same payment that was irreversible today, but will be reversible in a few months when some internal banking policy changes.

## Bisq vs DAIHard

Bisq and DAIHard are the only existing exchanges that are truly unkillable and attempt to provide global gateways to crypto. They address the problem in different ways.

Bisq solves this problem by vetting and limiting the payment methods available to users, but the side effect is that they exclude large swaths of humanity, and we‚Äôre reliant on the core developers to implement new payment methods in a rather slow, ponderous manner. For this task, we could accurately call Bisq a ‚Äúdemocratically controlled central planner‚Äù; there is no possibility of individuals spontaneously solving the problem in local situations.

On the other hand, DAIHard basically just shrugs its shoulders and expects the user to figure it out, under possible threat of burn if anything goes wrong. At first this will be a liability, simply intimidating new users, but in the long term it exposes this large, unwieldy problem to the incredible force of decentralized market intelligence.

## DAIHard Empowers the Market to Solve the Hard Problem

I have TransferWise. I‚Äôm pretty sure I can send payment to any other TransferWise user in the world with low fees. With DAIHard, I could open a trade (in fact I‚Äôve [already opened several](https://burnable-tech.github.io/DAIHard/marketplace)) that puts money behind this confidence. Others can commit to these trades if they dare, and the game theory should take care of the rest.

What‚Äôs happened here? Where did the hard problem go?

The problem only looks hard from the perspective of a central planner trying to solve it all at once. Thousands of payment silos with unknown characteristics---where would you even begin? But as an individual user I only need to answer a small part of that question: do I have access to any one fiat payment method that I can rely on? And the answer (for me) is: well, TransferWise seems pretty damn irreversible and pretty damn instant. Let‚Äôs give that a shot!

With Bisq, that doesn‚Äôt get me anywhere, because TransferWise is not one of the built-in payment methods. But with DAIHard I can put anything I want in the Payment Methods text box.

DAIHard pushes the problem to the edges of the network and gives its users the power to solve it for themselves. A user attempting to solve this problem will face risk, of course, but also opportunity for profit (you may have noticed all of my TW trades will net me a small bonus if someone commits!).

Remember that a DAIHard trade‚Äôs payment method is just a block of text which the offer creator fills in, and the offer filler reads and agrees to before committing, under threat of burn. This is extremely flexible. You could sell Dai for Steam credit, buy Dai by sending nudes, or hide cash bundles in some public park and sell their locations for Dai. All of this can be done without a single change to DAIHard itself.

DAIHard doesn‚Äôt solve the hard problem directly; rather, it is a platform that allows entrepreneurs to spontaneously solve bits and pieces of the problem and profit from doing so. And this is exactly the kind of problem that markets are particularly good at solving.",ethereum,"Fiat payment is inconsistent and often reversible, posing a complex challenge to any decentralized fiat/crypto gateway.

1575361949,7,1,"**Intro:** I work in a small boutique consulting firm. We assist clients with innovation projects. We're currently working with a large Nprdic government agency. They're responsible for public archiving. Basically, all government workers are required to archive certain information when they process certain cases. This information needs to be saved for a long time. The process today is ripe with inefficiencies and outdated systems. The suppliers of archiving systems are basically a duopoly. No innovation happening because they don't have to. Silos. Little interoperability. Little scalability. Upgrades means tacking on new features to an outdated system. You get the idea. 

**Now, why Ethereum?**
The agency has specifically requested that we look to radically transform the way archiving happens today. This means not only creating a far more user friendly solution, but also to look at the infrastructure underpinning this new solution. 

We should look to find a solution that is simultaneously a shared framework that can process and store information that follows a set standard, and at the same time allow for creating custom, agency specific applications (because archiving must be done in all of the public sector, but different agencies have different needs etc). 

I'm unsure if the agency would be willing to pay for gas. And tokens, I think, would not be useful. However, an open, shared infrastructure that isn't owned by one particular agency, which allows for continuous innovation, seems to tick many of the boxes. My first thought was therefore Ethereum. Am I wrong to think that? Are there better ways to solve the requirements mentioned above? Are there obvious drawbacks to using Ethereum? And where would Ethereum be advantageous over other solutions?",ethereum,Discussion: Simplifying archiving in the public sector with Ethereum

If you are building application which offers user to see his transaction history, or making an explorer like Etherscan, the feature to list transactions by address is necessary. 

To solve the issue, there is free and open source third-party solution ‚Äî Ethereum transaction Indexer: [https://github.com/Adamant-im/ETH-transactions-storage](https://github.com/Adamant-im/ETH-transactions-storage)

The Indexer allows to explore transactions by Ethereum address and obtain a history of any user|wallet in just a move, like Etherscan does. Indexer is written in Python. It works as a service in background:

*  connects to Ethereum node (works well with geth or parity, others are not tested) 
*  stores all transactions in Postgres database (including smart contract transactions) 
*  provides data for API to get transactions by address

Indexer connects to Ethereum node and fetches transactions using JSON RPC, creating transactions Index in Postgres database. First Indexer will store transactions starting from block you indicate. After that, it will check for new blocks every 20 seconds and update the index. You may change the interval.

API for Ethereum transaction Indexer is published by Postgrest tool. If you need to provide public API, use any webserver like nginx and setup proxy to Postgrest port in config.

After index is created, you can use requests like

`curl -k -X GET ""``http://localhost:3000/?and=(contract_to.eq.,or(txfrom.eq.0x6b924750e56a674a2ad01fbf09c7c9012f16f094,txto.eq.0x6b924750e56a674a2ad01fbf09c7c9012f16f094)``)&amp;order=time.desc&amp;limit=25""`

or

Today I woke up on Xmas to a strike warning from Youtube for harmful or dangerous content. Checked my email, nothing. A few hours later after Xmas lunch, another strike. I hadn't even done anything on Youtube since the first strike. Still no email. I cover a lot of topics related to finance, economics, housing market, stocks as well as crypto related content. We don't do paid ICO or token promotion. I have done tutorials on leverage trading platforms. I'm really not sure what to do. If the trend continues most crypto youtubers will be affected. I get there's plenty of bad guys out there, but there's plenty of good ones such as Omar &amp; myself who have been big advocates for Ethereum &amp; crypto for years. Wish us luck...

So my first strategy would be let the price go up and then sell, allow the week plus needed to move funds back into my bank. Wait for price of ETH to dip then re-buy back in with another exchange such as Coinbase.

Have any of you good folks had this problem? Any better methods out there I should look into? I can‚Äôt be the one and only who has had this problem with RB.

Therefore, liquidation would have to happen gradually, but a whale investor reducing their holdings would signal to the network that a major player perceived the future value or growth of the token as negligible. Thus the whale investor seems to be in a catch-22, of always being at risk of when reducing their investment.

The idea about tokenizing assets is fairly new but as the blockchain industry matures, the focus has shifted from ICO's or IEO's to Security Tokens. In essence, tokenizing an asset is basically using digital tokens to prove the ownership of the real asset. This provides a number of benefits that real assets do not offer.

[AVA Labs](https://www.avalabs.org/) is the only platform that is decentralized and can operate permissioned subnetworks and assets on a public network. In fact, AVA offers a higher transaction speed than Visa and more than enough scalability for any project. 

The tokenization of traditional assets provides a wide range of benefits like greater liquidity, 24/7 markets, lower transaction fees, improved compliance checks and more.

1581846441,0,1,"We have previously encountered Senator Nelson Aldrich in the context of the [formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEFlPwA8uEE):

Well, it turns out he played a pivotal role in another significant piece of legislation.

The 16th Amendment...

The 16th Amendment states that:

**""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""**

Now an income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska.

He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39.

However, the amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee Chairman.

Clearly, as we have seen in the Federal Reserve story, Aldrich was a man of significance with some pretty powerful friends. The 16th Amendment became part of the Constitution on February 25, 1913. This is the same year in which the Federal Reserve Act was passed, on December 23rd 1913.

The Sixteenth Amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding **direct taxes**, after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interests were considered direct taxes and ruled to be illegal.

Some would say that Federal income tax on labour has been unlawfully imposed on the American people and kept in place for over a century, contrary to various rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

But why? And where does the money go?

**Well, it exists such that successive federal governments can continue to pay the interest on money which, since 1913, they have been obligated to keep borrowing from central bankers, and which the government previously could print independently.**

Now of course: the Federal Reserve *is* the Independent Agency that controls the money supply. Don't just take my word for it, this is confirmed by [former Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w4AUAdN12c).

In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan requested an investigation, authorized in Executive Order 12369 on June 30, 1982.

President Reagan used the now famous phrase, ""Drain the swamp"".

The focus was waste and inefficiency in the US Federal government, and became known as **The Grace Commission.**

Its head, businessman J. Peter Grace, asked the members of that commission to ""Be bold and work like tireless bloodhounds, don't leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.""

Members of his team included one hundred and sixty-one top executives, assisted by 2,000 volunteers from the private sector.

They contributed more than $75 million worth of their time and resources to examine all major federal programs and agencies.

In January 1984, the Grace Commission‚Äôs work culminated in a report.

The conclusion of that report?

**""One third of all income taxes is consumed by waste and inefficiency; one third is not collected due to the underground economy; and 100% of all income taxes are absorbed by interest plus government contributions to transfer payments.""**

In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services that taxpayers expect from their government...

We are the team behind [Molecule](https://catalyst.molecule.to/) and are working on decentralizing drug development to bring more diverse treatments to patients. In January, we launched the first version of our dApp and together with the [Toronto Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://www.psychedelicscience.ca/), we have created the first crowdfunding campaign using cryptocurrency to fund an official clinical trial on the effects of microdosing psilocybin.

You can contribute using [Dai](https://makerdao.com/) or most other ERC20 tokens through our integration with [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/). Funds are solely managed through our smart contract infrastructure and in return for your support you receive a unique token that increases in value when more people contribute.

Please help us bring psilocybin closer to patients and [DONATE](https://app.catalyst.molecule.to/project/5e202ad3e8755f001cc679a7). All proceeds go directly to the research team!

3. Someone accepts to perform the task, and a smart contract is set up with an escrow.
4. The bounty hunter notifies he has completed the task.

6. The escrow resolves any conflicts that may arise.

I have never done much with ETH besides than playing some dAPP games.  
I was wondering if investing in ETH before 2.0 comes out is a good idea or not. I have somequestions regarding that.
Especially because of the 2.0 upgrade: I do not know how this upgrade will be done.  
Will ETH fork and I then have coins on both ETH1 and ETH2 chains?  
Will it be a completely new blockchain?  
I am asking these questions because I would want to invest long term but don‚Äòt want to end up with near worthless coins when 2.0 comes.   
  
Last question: Would holding via MetaMask be better than holding in an exchange? Exchanges do coin updates themselves and credit users the forked coins automatically while I might run into problems with MetaMask with that.

1589537588,0,1,"Hi everyone,  
this is a last stable [v7.0.0](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0) release for the Ethereum cross-client Consensus tests. This can be used by client developers to have a reference point to update test runners against before Berlin HF PRs (like [https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/685](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/685) for [EIP-2315](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2315) EVM subroutine support) get merged in.

This release will be followed up by one or more `v8.0.0-beta.x` releases with subsequently added Berlin HF tests until we reach a new stable ground here. It is of course still up to you and possible to use your own `ethereum/tests` snapshot from the latest `develop` branch state. This is just an additional offer which can e.g. serve as a reference point to compare client test runs against each other and identify bugs or inconsistencies.

Please have a closer look at the release notes - especially the ""Test Format Changes"" section - since there are significant changes since the last [v7.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.1) release. I would also advice to have a closer look at the number of tests run, since structural repo updates like changes in the folder structure might lead to some tests to be forgotten and went through unnoticed.

There are also several new test cases added along the way, which might trigger some failures on your test runs due to newly added edge cases.

All credits for the great work done here belong to [@winsvega](https://github.com/winsvega) together with contributions from [@shemnon](https://github.com/shemnon), [@spetz](https://github.com/spetz), [@holiman](https://github.com/holiman), [@gumb0](https://github.com/gumb0) and [@MrChico](https://github.com/MrChico).

If you are integrating the `ethereum/tests` library as a submodule here are some basic installation notes to upgrade your submodule to the latest release tag:

    cd [SUBMODULE_FOLDER]
    git fetch --tags origin develop
    git tag -l
    git checkout tags/[RELEASE_VERSION]
    cd ..
    git add [SUBMODULE_FOLDER]
    git commit -m ""[MESSAGE_ON_TEST_RELEASE_UPDATE]""

See [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/releases/tag/v7.0.0) linked or below for a full list of changes:

This is the last `Ethereum` tests release with a pre-`Berlin` HF state, so it provides some stable ground to upgrade client test runners against to be ready for a `Berlin` hardfork integration.

## Tests Added

## StateTests / BlockchainTests

## EIP-2200

Added state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) to validate the EIP-1706/[EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) out of gas condition, specifically aimed at validating less than or equals to the stipend handling, see `GeneralStateTests/stSStoreTest/sstore_gasLeft.json`, PR [\#649](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/649)

## DIV/SDIV/MOD/SDIV by Zero

Added state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) checking DIV/SDIV/MOD/SDIV by zero, see `GeneralStateTests/stSolidityTest/ByZero.json`, PR [\#647](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/647)

## Stack Validity of SWAP

Added tests checking stack validity of SWAP, see `GeneralStateTests/stStackTests/stackOverflowSWAP.json` and `[..]/stacksanitySWAP.json`, PR [\#647](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/647)

## EXTCODEHASH Empty Account

Added more EXTCODEHASH state tests (also as `BlockchainTests`) of nonexistent and post suicide accounts, see `GeneralStateTests/stExtCodeHash/callToNonExistent.json`, `[..]/callToSuicideThenExtcodehash.json` and `[..]/createEmptyThenExtcodehash.json`, PR [\#654](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/654)

## SELFBALANCE in different Call Types

Added a composite state test (also in `BlockchainTests`) for SELFBALANCE that will do all the exisitng test inside of CALL, DELEGATECALL, and CALLCODE calls, see `GeneralStateTests/stSelfBalance/selfBalanceCallTypes.json`, PR [\#671](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/671)

## Retesteth Unit Tests

Introduced retesteth unitTests in `BlockchainTests/InvalidBlocks/bcExpectSection/filling_unexpectedAccount.json`, PR [\#676](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/676)

## Difficulty Tests

Added difficulty tests for [EIP-2384](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2384) (Muir Glacier Difficulty Bomb Delay), PR [\#662](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/662)

## Keystore Tests

Added KeyStore test based on MyCrypto file in order to ensure that the generated file is compatible with MyCrypto and Metamask, PR [\#665](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/665)

## RLP Tests

Added RLP invalid tests for insufficient bytes, see `RLPTests/invalidRLPTest.json`, PR [\#614](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/614)

## Test Format Changes

## BlockChainTests

## LegacyTests

`BlockChain` tests up to `ConstantinopleFix` (aka `Petersburg`) now also have been moved to the \[LegacyTests/\] folder, the main test folders on this release only contain the `Istanbul` tests, PR [\#648](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/648)

## VMTests -&gt; BlockchainTests

`VMTests` have been converted to `BlockchainTests` and can now be found in `BlockchainTests/ValidBlocks/VMTests/`, PR [\#680](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/680)

## PostState Correction

On some LegacyTests `postState` has been corrected to `postStateHash`, you can use this [repo search](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/search?q=postStateHash&amp;unscoped_q=postStateHash) to see which tests are affected. This might need some adoption of your test runner.

## InvalidBlockChain Tests: Expected Block Exceptions

Major blockchain test refactoring, and regeneration on geth + retesteth, see [files diff](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/672/files) for an impression on the format changes (`InvalidBlockchainTests`). PR [\#672](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/672)

* Remove retesteth configs, configs are now stored in retesteth repo. PR [\#666](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/666)

## Test Fixes

* Reduce 50k bytes code in quadratic complexity tests to 20k bytes. Resolves issue [https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/657](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/issues/657), see `GeneralStateTests/stQuadraticComplexityTest/Call[*]KbytesContract[*].json`, PR [\#658](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/658) and PR [\#669](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/669)
* Minor changes to the test filler format around field strictness, affected tests `BlockchainTests/InvalidBlocks/bcExpectSection/filling_wrongStorage2.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stExtCodeHash/*`, `GeneralStateTests/stRandom/` (3), `GeneralStateTests/stReturnDataTest/subcallReturnMoreThenExpected.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stStaticCall/static_call_value_inherit.json`, `GeneralStateTests/stTransactionTest/Opcodes_TransactionInit.json`, PR [\#677](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/677)

**Options details:** 

* Strike price: $200.00 
* Underlying Asset: ETH 
* Expiration: May 29, 2020 at 8:00am UTC 
* Token address:  [0x7cac16770dd5f2a59859a395a492224f05a846b6](https://deploy-preview-193--trusting-spence-a8ac87.netlify.app/#/sell/0x7cac16770dd5f2a59859a395a492224f05a846b6)

**What are the advantages of trading oTokens on Gnosis Protocol?** 

* **Permissionless**: Opyn options have an expiration date, which means that every new options series has a new token address. Gnosis Protocol‚Äôs permissionless architecture enables anyone to list new option series. 
* **Batch auctions:** Gnosis Protocol‚Äôs underlying trading mechanism, batch auctions, enables liquidity to be shared amongst all assets listed on the protocol. It doesn‚Äôt limit liquidity to single token pairs. 
* **No slippage**: As long as there is sell liquidity for any oToken, it‚Äôs guaranteed that you won‚Äôt get a worse price than your limit price.

1595234994,3,3," 

Dear Ethereum Community,

I am rather new to this Cryptocurrency realm and have encountered a conundrum. I purchased a Trezor One device, some Bitcoin and ETH recently. I transferred the Bitcoins with no problem to my Trezor device from the Kraken platform. I then attempted to send one Ethercoin (as a test) to my Trezor device. Unbeknownst to me, my Trezor device firmware had not been updated to receive the Ether coin. So, in brief, the Trezor device ushered me into the My Etherwallet Interface and in no way warned me that the device would be unable to receive the coin. Regardless, an address was generated during this process and I sent the coin. It was received into Etherscan but when I login to my Ether Wallet there is no indication the coin was received. I have been juggling messages from Etherscan support and Trezor support, yielding no solutions. Can anyone out there in Cryptoland help me understand how this happened and if indeed, my funds are lost? I see no way to access and transfer these funds. Has this ever happened to anyone out there? A steep and costly learning curve indeed. All input is very much appreciated. Thank You. Cryptomess 672",ethereum,Ethercoin stuck in an Etherscan address.... HELP!

With me I look for the amount of coins in circulation/ generated. Whether they are bomb token ect. I look to see if there any any one wallet with a huge % of coins in, as to try and avoid a pump and dump (but its more difficult now due to pools), check to see if the contract has reviews/been audited.

Create an application that will collect data from the Ethereum blockchain about transactions associated with a specific wallet address that the user inputs. The app should get information on the wallets (addresses) and amounts of ETH associated with transactions made to and from a certain given wallet and either store them in a database of choice or show them in a simple human-readable way (ideally, through a web page). Collect transaction data starting from a given block (do not crawl the entire blockchain).

**Example**: If a user requests to view transactions associated with the address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* from block *9000000* to the current block it should be able to crawl and visualize all transaction data (addresses that sent to and received tokens from address *0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f* , and how much ETH was used for a given transaction) in that period of time.

However, I instantly remember how some people made claims that public wifi is not secure and we shouldn't try to log into important pages using public wifi.  


I'm not that technical but just curious if there's any slight possibility that my metamask sensitive info (private key or backup phrase or even just the standard password to login to the metamask extension) get leaked through the public wifi for any kind of reason?

Then, the contract measures how much of the asset it has received, by comparing the last recorded balance to its current balance. This means the core contract is agnostic to the way in which the trader transfers the asset. Instead of transferFrom, it could be a meta transaction or any other future mechanism for authorizing the transfer of ERC-20s.

I am interested in buying some ethereum, but I don't really know the best way to go about it. I don't really want to use sites like coinbase, I don't really trust those. In the research I have done so far I have read about ""hardware"" wallets, how exactly do these work, and how do I buy coin to put in these wallets. Also, once I have bought some ethereum, Is there a way I can easily check how much I have etc, like I would on my regular banking app for example. I know these might be some basic questions, I just want to know all possible options. Hopefully you can point me in the right direction.",ethereum,Advice on buying ethereum

I know these dumb questions might annoy some so I do apologise in advance.

 I have a ledger wallet arriving in 1.5 weeks time and will be getting some Ethereum using Kraken. I won't be able to stake independently unfortunately as 32 ETH is out of budget, as is 16 which is a soon to be possibility with some pools.

I'd love to keep the eth with kraken and stake there but all it takes is 1 bad breach into kraken and you're in danger, hence the ledger x purchase.

Now I know with Ada you can move it to the ledger x, then to yoroi and stake that way, being secure.

What's the best option for someone like me. Who will be getting ethereum soon. Do I get the eth through kraken and stake there? Or do I just throw it into my ledger x and hodl with no staking.

2. Has to be posted as a comment under this post.
3. Has to have at least 30 meme submissions before a winner is decided.
4. Has to have the most upvotes by May 15th

IMHO, Ethereum's high network gas fees are, after all, a good thing during this super-inflated bubbly bull-run and sh\*t-coin era. These fees are saving Ethereum's ecosystem from projects without use or vision and making it an actual valuable one.

\- The 640 shards is obviously unsafe right now, as Vitalik's post argues, but could be a possibility over the decade as SSD costs continue declining. Obviously, it'll happen in steps. I also feel the rollup revolution is inevitable and the most likely outcome for L1 is a subset of shards have execution enabled years down the line, after stateless/expiry, with ZK proofs, while most shards remain focused on data availability.

- It‚Äôs ultra unsound money. Constant changes to the base protocol, some of which proved to have near-fatal bugs, make it an untrustworthy SoV. PoS increases implementation risks and will anyways make the network more centralized and thus less neutral than Bitcoin. Sure, EIP1559 will have a nice effect on pumping the price of ETH but it will still be as much an SoV as AWS credits are.
- Users don‚Äôt care about decentralization. BSC already flippening Ethereum in terms of transactions, continuing increase in traction for other more centralized chains, and the proliferation of sidechains like Polygon show that users don‚Äôt really care about decentralization on the application layer, but care more about usability/performance/low fees. Even if L2 finally makes a dent there are major caveats. Bitcoin will be the base money protocol whereas other, more centralized chains will be basically layers on top of Bitcoin‚Äôs base layer through bridges. Even protocols on top of Bitcoin like RSK/Stacks will eat into Defi. Ethereum is stuck in the middle. 
- It doesn‚Äôt have a clear vision. Retail normies have no idea what Ethereum really does and would rather go all in on dog coins. It‚Äôs a playground for web devs and early investors who can afford the stupendously high fees. Web2/Tradfi normies have lately been joining in on the altcoin casino fun. But it won‚Äôt ever be a platform for banking the unbanked.",ethereum,Ethereum == MySpace

Edit 2: Or am I visualising it all wrong (I came across the statement that wallets don't actually HODL any crypto -- they technically are just keys) and actually a wallet just acts a key that various different blockchains can accept?

Edit 3: It seems like e.g. Trust is actually an account that compiles a bunch of different wallet addresses and keys for different blockchains, so it's actually an aggregated wallet, not a single address that's compatible with a bunch of blockchains...

 Ethereum on a fundamental level is bitcoin + dapps. The value of Satoshi's invention is not the speed or the transaction costs of moving money, because you could host this on AWS and be 100,000x more efficient. Infact, things like ApplePay already do this. Instead, the value of Satoshi's invention was the decentralized computer network itself and its self-sustaining game theory that makes it impervious to attacks.

What people want are capps, not dapps. Capps can have all the functions of dapps but be faster because they run on AWS.  It might not be what cypherpunks like Nick Szabo dreamed of, but it's the only way these financial applications scale for a world-wide audience. 

Just remove the blockchain element out of Ethereum and centralize it to make it optimized for these capps.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-gold) Something like this, but focused on capps. You make an account, KYC, and everything. But retain all the features of moving money around from wallet to wallet and using centralized financial applications. Tokens, Yield farming, borrowing/lending, and NFTs all without blockchain. Infact, I think NFTs are way better suited on centralized servers as you could have an NYSE version of NFTs that are actually legally recognized as intellectual property.

Don't be surprised if Coinbase or Cashapp are the first to do this and steal a large amount of momentum away from dapps.",ethereum,The future of dapps is not on blockchain.

But as a student and having only entered the space recently I don‚Äôt own massive amounts of ETH, as such these gas prices are killing me.

It‚Äôs not really that I mind having gas prices (I kind of see it as paying to access the internet) but the fact that 32gwei gets destroyed is difficult to think about.

Imagine that base fee got sent to a DAO-based treasury that could fund developers/projects and each month the eth-community could vote on which project would receive funding‚Ä¶ That would be pretty cool.

What do you think could be a better use of the base fee instead of burning it? Maybe sending it back to the user?

Since then I have slowly stacked Ether and have been staking try to play my part in the future of the network. However, I am curious about marketplaces such as OpenSea and their role in the network with NFT's.

&amp;#x200B;

I have largely stayed away from the whole gas debate as I would like to think with the future of Layer 2 solutions and sharding the gas situation will resolve itself with time. However, as I am yet to buy or mint and NFT I was thinking about their role on Layer 1 and was wondering if it is possible to transfer them to Layer 2. I am under the impression that a NFT can be minted on Layer 2, then that NFT will stay on the Layer 2 network. Unless like ETH, you are able to onboard and offboard NFTs from L1 - L2. Correct me if I am wrong but would this imply that all NFTs that have been minted on Layer 1, will permanently stay on L1? Moving forward would thing also imply that minted an NFT on L2 the NFT will only exist on L2?

Being a student from India, It was actually too good of a deal as $50 is so much money in here.

I convinced my Parents so that I can transfer my deposit money from Bank to Celcius as bank gives merely 2-3% interest.

I decided to use Binance lite to purchase crypto, I didn't had credit card(and the fees were too high) So I chose P2P.. It matched me to someone who started messaging me claiming to send the money to a different upi. I told him I can't do that, so he wrote he's going to send me in an instant if I do that and his main upi is not working. So I sent him, He stopped responding me then, I understood I got scammed.. I contacted their Service but no response. Its been a week now. I'm done with Cryptocurrencies.

My parents sometimes asks me how is my investment doing and it breaks my heart to answer that question.

I learned my lesson very soon. I thought I can be of some help to them but I've let them down. If only I had played it safe.

1635928734,165,1,"Hello r/ethereun community, 
I am studying Environmental Management and I have recently finished a research project on Ethereum's future energy comsumption under Proof-of-Stake. 
I have originally posted this in r/ethfinance but was asked to share it with those of you interested as well.    
[You can find the full report here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f1nle6ioiyz5wbf/%E2%80%98Proof-of-Stake%E2%80%99%20as%20a%20solution%20to%20the%20blockchain%20energy%20problem.pdf?dl=0)    

**For all others, I'll quickly summarise the results:**

[Ethereum (mining) is currently estimated to use around 80 TWh of energy annually.](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption)
 
I tried to model energy consumption for Proof-of-Stake.    
Currently there are about 250,000 active validators. I split validators into two categories: private stakers and institutional stakers. Private stakers are people running a setup from home (or hosted on a cloud server). Each staker currently runs 5.4 validators on average. Because they probably don't have setups optimized for energy consumption, I estimated every staker to use 100W of energy, so about 18.52W per validator.
For institutional stakers, such as exchanges, I used 5 W per validator, as suggested by [Carl Beekhuizen from the Ethereum foundation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/). Currently about half of validators seem to be run by each category. **This puts the current estimated energy consumption at 2.94 MW or 25.754 GWh annually.**    
 
For the future I have considered a limit of 524,000 validators as proposed by Vitalik in the past. I made one model assuming the share of private vs institutional stakers remains 50-50 and one that assumes a shift towards circa 25-75, since there will probably be more people using staking services rather than setting up new own validators in the future. **The last scenario, which I find to be more likely, puts power consumption at 4.31 MW or 37.756 GWh annually** (the 50-50 scenario would mean 6.16MW / 53.98 GWh annually).    
**Overall, the transition to Proof-of-Stake represents a decrease in energy consumption by at least 99.93 to 99.95 percent compared to current PoW**    

So instead of using as much power as the entire country of Chile, Ethereum will only use the equivalent of between 710 to 1650 average Australians in the future.    

Of course those numbers could change slightly in case the maximum number of validators ends up significantly higher or the stake needed for a validator were to change, but this model at least is able to demonstrate the magnitude in difference for power consumption between PoW and PoS.    

PS: Please don't be too harsh on my report, the main focus was on the environmental impact of Ethereum and the technical details are very simplified. If you want to share my report somewhere, please dm me.",ethereum,My research on future Ethereum energy use

If you want to try it out for free first, you can also opt for the **free** Midnight Blue card which has no fee and **1% cashback** :)

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged that high fees are threatening the future of the decentralised economy. 

He noted that the increased fees are disrupting Ethereum's usability.
He also expressed his frustration with high fees and how such fees hinder the implementation of critical projects. Despite this, he was optimistic that sharding could reduce the fees by implementing sharding.

Aside from high fees, the platform's decentralised goal could be jeopardised by bad actors motivated by personal gain. Ethereum's founder believes that solving shortcomings such as gas fees could enable it to become a foundation for socio-political change.
Although Ethereum has received criticism for its high fees, data shows a shift. The Ethereum blockchain on March 9 recorded a drop in transaction gas fees to a six-month low, the lowest level since August 2021. 
Meanwhile, ETH remains to be a preferred transaction method. Crayon DAO raised 900 ETH to purchase an ancient artefact from the museum on the brink of bankruptcy. Ethereum is working to roll out the PoS with the planned merge; we could see new projects hopping onboard. The coming Ethereum Merge will aid in connecting the existing Mainnet with the Beacon Chain PoS mechanism. Hence, the much-awaited shift to PoS could change the future of crypto and how they operate.",ethereum,Ethereum Shift to PoS Could be the Change in Crypto's Future

1649754191,0,1,"ETH 2.0 holds the key to $10,000.

The upcoming proof-of-stake merge will have incredibly bullish implications for the Ether cryptocurrency. According to independent crypto analyst and investor Lark Davis, the upgrade could bolster the bulls to break out of range and take Ether to $10,000 highs.

2022 is set to be Ethereum‚Äôs most important year. Although the date is not disclosed yet, Ethereum is preparing to complete the long-awaited Merge of its proof-of-work and proof-of-stake chains, dubbed ETH 2.0.

Lark Davis is confident that the Merge will push the price of the native token ETH to $10,000. ‚ÄúSorry haters, but it is happening!‚Äù ‚Äî said Davis.

Further, with a rising ETH, the NFT space will resurrect again. Fundamentally sound projects associated with the NFT ecosystem such as Plastiks (which focuses on a Recycling Recovery system that drives accountability and traceability through the plastic supply chain), Theta (which focuses on rendering VR worlds in real-time), and Axie Infinity (an NFT-based online video game) could see humongous rallies.

The ETH 2.0 Upgrade will make Ether a deflationary asset thanks to the significant reduction of the amount of ETH issued by Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-1559 burning mechanism.

Additionally, the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol that Ethereum will transition to, will be more eco-friendly than the current proof-of-work (PoW) system that rewards miners for solving complex computational puzzles to validate transactions on the network.

With the Merge, 2022 could be the year that Ethereum realizes its full potential!",ethereum,"‚ÄúSorry, Haters!‚Äù Lark Davis Says Ethereum is About to Fly to $10,000!"

Ethereum's anticipated move from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a full proof-of-stake (PoS) system is known as The Merge. Ethereum's hashrate reached an all-time high (ATH) of 1.131 petahash per second (PH/s) on April 7, 2022. 

According to measures derived from a three-month chart provided on coinwarz.com, Ethereum's hashrate hit a new high of 1.148 PH/s today. Ethereum developer Tim Beiko published a core devs update on Twitter the day before.

An individual questioned Beiko about Ethereum miners who have been safeguarding the network in a Twitter thread. The Ethereum engineer was questioned if miners will be ""left out to dry."" 

Beiko responded to the individual by stating that he would not be investing in any mining gear in the future. ""At this moment, I would highly advise against investing in further mining equipment,"" the Ethereum engineer tweeted. The individual then inquired as to whether the ""plug pull"" was scheduled for June or if the ether mining community had additional time. Beiko also responded to that query, saying: 

It won't be in June, but rather a few months later. We don't have a clear date yet, but we're approaching the end of the PoW era on Ethereum. Ethereum is used for several purposes including as a fuel for NFTs and also by tea for its activities of rewarding web developers.",ethereum,"Ethereum Dev Says The Merge Could Be Delayed a Few Months, 'Strongly Suggests' Not Investing in ETH Mining Rigs"

I was fed up with it all because the problem kept reappearing, so I decided to speak with other Eth owners to investigate the alternatives and solutions and see what would work best for me.  


I've heard of a few platforms that offer, among other things, transaction, pricing, and speed benefits, and one of those platforms is Metis, which I intend to try out.

Now, this sum is enormous, and the environmental damage it could cause is enormous!!

Consumers today are very interested in activities that benefit a good cause. I'm not sure if this is just a marketing ploy or if they truly want to make a difference in the world. And I don't think efficiency will help the project move forward in the coming years; in the end, utility and usability are the most important factors, and efficiency is merely a byproduct.

For musicians and filmmakers in the entertainment industry, Audius and Theta provide a decentralised network. Many cryptocurrency YouTubers post their videos on Theta, where they keep the majority of the profits. Audius is a web and mobile app that allows musicians to interact directly with their fans, similar to Spotify. There will be no middleman taking the lion's share of the profit or interfering with the artist's creative process.

Even in the EV industry, something like bob eco coin, which uses its token for various causes and even uses EVs to combat pollution, is helping with a different approach. These are some industries that I never imagined would adopt blockchain in 2016 or 2017. Do you believe it will have an impact on industries that are slower to move, such as metals and minerals, which are completely different? I believe they can integrate supply chains, but do you have any other suggestions for how blockchain could be used?",ethereum,"Is efficient coin a marketing myth created by large corporations to attract customers' attention?

I learned (correct me if I'm wrong) that Etherum is a decentralized infrastructure (= network of nodes) that host a blockchain service on top of it. Every node on this network stores the complete history of the blockchain from the genesis and must agree on the state of the EVM (which I did not understand that much, but anyway).

Blockchain is composed of blocks, and every block is composed by some transactions and some other data (the hash of the parent I guess(?)). The thing that I'm not understanding is, where are smart contract stored? Are they stored on blocks or somewhere else?",ethereum,Ssmart contracts

1653213146,0,1,"Preston Van Loon, core developer of the Ethereum network, told attendees at the Permissionless conference that the transition, known as The Merge, will occur sometime in August if everything goes according to plan.

And now with the rapid growth of web3 that now has protocols like OceanProtocol, or protocols for development like Tea, it is more than necessary for The Merge to happen, for the growth of the technology.

Fellow Ethereum researcher Justin Drake stated that ensuring The Fusion went ahead quickly was a top priority, and shared his ""strong desire for this to happen before the difficulty bomb in August.""

The ""hardship bomb"" refers to the program coded into Ethereum's blockchain that intentionally slows down the network. It was designed to encourage the transition to PoS by making it harder for miners to stay on the proof-of-work (PoW) chain after The Merge.

If the merger goes through successfully in August, the final milestone on the Ethereum roadmap, formerly known as Eth2, is the upgrade of the fragmented chains, which is scheduled for early 2023. 

Until then, however, the network will continue to use Layer 2 networks such as Polygon and Optimism to handle scalability and high transaction volumes.",ethereum,"Ethereum developers report that The Merger will occur in August ""if all goes according to plan."""

Let say there is a short range fork and I am an honest block producing staker. I choose a single chain to produce my blocks on, but soon understand I have betted on the losing chain. When exactly can I start producing blocks for the favored chain w.o. gettign slashed? After it has been finalized after 2 epochs (iirc)?

That's what DAOs are supposed to be: communities. And that's also what NFT collections are supposed to be too. That's an extremely useful concept anytime you need coordination towards a common goal, for a given economic activity, without the frictions traditional structures experience. 

Yet, we're not having much community build up, for the moment, or in a very closed-minded mindset. Why is that? 

To me, that's because, for most use cases of coordination, we'd need transactions to be extremely cheap, like what we have in L2s. With expensive transactions, you only attract wealthy communities or ones that produce lots of money, notably through investment. But that's because L2s weren't fully ready yet, for this cycle. And that's most probably the next phase: use cases on L2s; unless if it's tokenized physical items. Or unless if it's a mix of these two concepts? 

So, communities, ok, cool... but then... what for? 

Let's face it, the biggest concern people are interested in is being recognized by the market as having provided valuable services. Aka, being rich. We're seeing it first hand right now. Because that's how you get the cooperation from others for (almost) whatever interests you anyway. 

And the limit most people reach in this is the human limit: you can only go so far as your own body can go. One job, full time, is already much if you're brave enough, you can try doing more, but you quickly reach that limit, whatever the means of production you use, because they're not scalable, they're limited by your own body. And that's precisely why skilled investors are so successful: they don't just use their body, they use other means of production, scalable ones.

People want to do that. They want to provide services with more than their body. They want to own things that service others such that they're paid for it. They're already ready for that. They even do it, sadly with lots of unnecessary efforts (and that's the point, here), but under another name: side hustle, side gigs, that sort of things. 

Platforms for many services between people could exist. Electricity, for instance, is a pretty good use case and has already been show cased in Brooklyn, thanks to another crypto. People provide a service beyond what their body can provide and they're paid for it. And whenever they need it, they pay it from others too, at a lesser cost compared to traditional market prices. That's useful, that's productive. 

We can have many more such services. Closed-circuit food providers, for instance, or short-rent housing services, that sort of things. We already have such platforms, but they're centralized. They're necessarily distorting prices because they're not in a frictionless market.",ethereum,Building proftable communities

1655632097,0,1,"#  Bridging Ethereum

This post will attempt to explain why interoperability between Ethereum domains is difficult, and from there show why we think NXTP represents the beginning of a true long-term solution for the ecosystem. 

 NXTP - [protocol for enabling fully trustless transfers and contract calls between Ethereum-compatible domains](https://medium.com/connext/nxtp-a-simpler-xchain-protocol-88760697ea04) (domains = chains &amp; L2s). 

# The Need for Trustless Ethereum Interoperability

Multichain/L2 Ethereum is here, and it‚Äôs here to stay. This has spurred the creation of dozens of new bridges and interoperability protocols as projects have scrambled to enable this functionality for DeFi.

As can be expected, this has also brought on a number of high profile hacks and scams:

* The multiple Thorchain hacks.
* The PolyNetwork hack.

Despite these examples, every bridging system out there markets itself as trustless, secure, and decentralized (even if that‚Äôs not at all the case). This means big challenge for developers and users is now, ‚Äúhow can I figure out which bridging mechanisms are actually cryptoeconomically secure?‚Äù

In other words, how can users discern between types of bridges to determine who they are trusting when moving funds between chains?

## What Does ‚ÄúTrustless‚Äù Actually Mean in Cryptoeconomics?

In the research community, when we talk about cryptoeconomic security and the property of trustlessness, we are really asking one very specific question:

&gt;*Who is verifying the system and how much does it cost to corrupt them?*

If our goal is to build truly decentralized, uncensorable public goods, then we have to consider that our systems could be attacked by incredibly powerful adversaries like rogue sovereign nations, megacorporations, or megalomaniacal evil geniuses.

Maximizing security means maximizing the number and diversity of verifiers (validators, miners, etc.) in your system, and this typically means trying your best to have a system that is verified entirely by Ethereum‚Äôs validator set. This is the core idea behind L2 and Ethereum‚Äôs approach to scalability.

&gt;*Aside: Most people don‚Äôt realize this, but scalability research is interoperability research. We‚Äôve known we can scale by moving to multiple domains for ages, the problem has always been how to enable communicating to those domains trustlessly. That‚Äôs why John Adler‚Äôs seminal paper on optimistic rollups is titled, ‚ÄúTrustless Two-Way Bridges With Sidechains By Halting‚Äù.*

## What Happens If We Add New Verifiers Between Domains?

Let‚Äôs take what we‚Äôve learned above about cryptoeconomic security and apply it to bridges.

https://preview.redd.it/mdawgg4atj691.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7010e8a1e01f4a235b45db893caa2ed875e765c7

Consider a scenario where you have your funds on Arbitrum. You‚Äôve specifically chosen to use this domain because it is a rollup, meaning that (with some reasonable assumptions) your funds are fully secured by Ethereum‚Äôs underlying verifiers. In other words, your funds are about as cryptoeconomically secure as they can possibly be in the blockchain ecosystem.

Now imagine that you decide to use a bridge to move your funds cheaply and quickly to Optimism. Optimism is also trustless, so you feel comfortable having your funds there knowing that they will share the same level of security (Ethereum‚Äôs security) that they do on Arbitrum.

https://preview.redd.it/jrlpfozbtj691.png?width=751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d651026edc6dab716b6f65bf9c0920080fdacc2

However, the bridge protocol that you use utilizes it‚Äôs own set of external verifiers. While this may not initially seem like a big deal, your funds are now no longer secured by Ethereum, but instead by the verifiers of the bridge:

* If this is a lock/mint bridge, creating wrapped assets, then the bridge verifiers can now unilaterally collude to steal all of your funds.
* If this is a bridge that uses liquidity pools, the bridge verifiers can similarly collude to steal all of the pool capital from LPs.

Despite having waited years for secure, trustless L2s, your situation is now the same as if you had used a trusted sidechain or L1 construction. 

The key takeaway is that cryptoeconomic systems are only as secure as their weakest link. When you use insecure bridges, it doesn‚Äôt matter how secure your chain or L2 is anymore. And, similar to the security of L1s and L2s, it all comes entirely down to one question: who is verifying the system?

## The Interoperability Trilemma

Now we get to the thesis of this article, and the mental model that should drive user and developer decisions around bridge selection.

https://preview.redd.it/x1lmxsqntj691.png?width=895&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc222cd6dbc2692d66f8f1acf8bf09bc3f2bc26

Similar to the Scalability Trilemma, there exists an Interoperability Trilemma in the Ethereum ecosystem. Interop protocols can only have two of the following three properties:

* **Trustlessness:** having equivalent security to the underlying domains.
* **Extensibility:** able to be supported on any domain.
* **Generalizeability:** capable of handling arbitrary cross-domain data.

# How Do Connext and NXTP Fit Into This?

There‚Äôs no easy way for us to get all three desireable interoperability properties. We‚Äôve realized, however, that we can take the same approach to solving the Interoperability Trilemma that Ethereum does to solving the Scalability Trilemma.

Ethereum L1 optimizes for security and decentralization at the cost of scalability. The rationale behind this is that these properties are likely the most important for the longevity and utility of a blockchain. Ethereum then adds scalability via L2/sharding as a layer on top of an existing secure and decentralized backbone.

At Connext, we strongly believe that the interoperability system with the most longevity, utility, and adoptability in the Ethereum ecosystem will be one that is maximally trustless and extensible. For this reason, NXTP is a locally verified system specifically designed to be as secure as the underlying domains while still being usable on any domain.

So what about generalizeability? Similar to scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem, we can add generalizeability by plugging in natively verified protocols on top of NXTP (as a ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù of our interop network!). That way, users and developers get a consistent interface across any domain, and can ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù their connection to be generalized in cases where that functionality is available.

https://preview.redd.it/pxa92hqqtj691.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dbf291042c3d072bba827cdbad0f67558d43c8d

 This is why we say NXTP is the **base protocol** of our interoperability network. The full network will be made of up of a **stack** of protocols which will include NXTP, generalized crosschain bridges specific to a pair of domains, and protocols to connect them all together into one seamless system. 

#  About Connext

Connext is a network for fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively cross-chain applications. To date, over $1.5b in transactions have crossed the network.

Recently, bancor as the pioneer of AMM and impermanent loss protection has been in huge trouble with huge deficits over $40 million at its peak due to hostile market conditions. As we all know normal impermanent loss is just only 20% even with 80% price down, which is why the author said that the impermanence loss protection of bancor exceeds the impermanence loss itself. If you are interested, you can refer to the previous analysis article.

[https://x3finance.medium.com/bnt-impermanent-loss-protection-will-pay-much-more-than-impermanent-loss-itself-3034d9dc0052](https://x3finance.medium.com/bnt-impermanent-loss-protection-will-pay-much-more-than-impermanent-loss-itself-3034d9dc0052)

But some people want to know which is bigger for the loss of impermanent loss protection and market price fluctuations? We know that the volatility loss of the market is ML(%)=P0/Pn-1, that is, we need to compare the sizes of the following two formulas:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lxgp5s6rw3991.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb93649e3d4d07d89769e5a963be5eb6b347a2cb

 

wherein P0 is the initial price and Pn is the current price.

As can be seen from the figure below, when Pn/P0&lt;0.3, the loss of impermanent loss protection will exceed the loss of price fluctuations. And the loss of impermanent loss protection is as high as 250% which is far exceeding the decreasing of BNT price just only 85% from April 3 to July 2. Therefore, the loss of BNT impermanent loss protection is not only higher than impermanent loss itself, but also would even exceed the decline in market prices. Under extreme conditions, the hyperinflation of BNT will increase exponentially, and you may lose all your capital.

Few industries, however, have had a larger impact in the preceding year than gaming, which has seen the emergence of a whole new generation of play-to-earn products.  


Did you start playing these games, and what are your thoughts on them?  


P2E games, sometimes known as ""GameFi,"" leverage blockchain and associated technologies such as NFTs and cryptocurrencies to allow players to earn legitimate incentives that can be sold for real-world currency.  


Most game creators have begun to use Altura and other platforms, which may assist you in creating an NFT marketplace for these NFT game-in content. All of these technologies are really useful and important to developers, but I've been wondering how you select which blockchain is the best.  


What are your thoughts? Do you have any suggestions? I'd want to know why you choose the blockchain you picked, please.

Electronic gaming has been one of the most vocal promoters of blockchain technology, with the goal of revolutionizing the working processes.   
 

When it comes to GameFi, users may experience the benefits of both DeFi and Decentralized Gaming at the same time.   
 

Cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens, and Play-to-Earn games are among the several factors that support GameFi. The marriage of the two innovative conceptions results in two realities:   
 

DeFi portals provide access to game-style services.   
Blockchain-empowered games incorporating elements of DeFi.   
 

So, when it comes to GameFi's popularity, the sector has effectively emerged as the trendiest area of the gaming world, with followers ranging from young players to tech-savvy, fun-loving specialists who appreciate this new era of making money while playing video games.   
 

We're lucky because systems like Altura now allow game developers who want to integrate NFTs in their games to use blockchain-based assets in their apps without having any web3 knowledge, which is amazing.

# Is Ethereum a Security?

The question of if Ethereum is a security has been a topic of hot debate, especially as Ethereum transitioned to ‚ÄúProof-of-Stake‚Äù a model in which users stake their Ether on a validator and take part in rewards for validating the network.  
In order to answer if Ethereum is a security, at least in the eyes of US regulators, we must view it through the lens of a test known as the ‚Äú*Howey Test*‚Äù which is a **three-pronged**[1](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:1) that determines if Ethereum is a security.  
It should be noted that *all* three prongs of the test must be met for something to be deemed a security.  
We can review the elements of the test individually:  


## 1. An investment of money:

Prong #1 is simple and does not require debate. Ethereum **does** meet this criteria in a Proof-of-Stake model and requires a user buying or acquiring Ethereum to take part in staking.

The word ‚Äú*money*‚Äù does not negate or by-pass this prong.

The case ‚Äú*State V Gopher Tire and Rubber Co*‚Äù[2](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:2) the court notes that ‚Äú*laying out of capital in a way intended to secure income or employement*‚Äù is sufficient to meet this prong.

It is also noted in ‚Äú*Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight*‚Äù[3](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:3) the court expressly found that the ‚Äú*investment of money*‚Äù can take the forms of ‚Äú*goods or services*‚Äù or another ‚Äú*exchange of value*.‚Äù

Lastly, in ‚Äú*SEC v. Shavers*‚Äù[4](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:4) the court expressly found that Bitcoin and other digital currencies could meet the standard of ‚Äúan investment of *money*.‚Äù

**Status:** Meets this Prong

## 2. In a common enteprise:

In order to review this prong one needs to understand:

* [Common Enterprise](https://isethereumasecurity.com/CommonEnterprise.html)
* [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html)
* [Ethereum Rewards &amp; Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html)

The short summary of the Ethereum Validation system is:  


* Your funds are not pooled with other stakers.
* If your validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) only you receive a penalty.
* Penalties take place if are offline too long (failed technical effort) or if you are malicious.
* You are only rewarded based on the role of your validator.
* Validators are rewarded for reporting slashable offenses, making them adversarial and not communal.
* Individual block proposers profit from extended effort such as MEV that is not shared by others.  
In line which each framing of common enterprise:  


### Horizontal Commonality:

As outlined in ‚Äú*Revak v SEC Realty Corp*‚Äù[5](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:5) the court looks for ‚Äú*the pro-rata distribution of profits*‚Äù and the ‚Äú*tying together of investors assets, via the pooling of funds*.‚Äù

In ‚Äú*Hart v. Pulte Homes of Michigan Corp*‚Äù[6](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:6) and ‚Äú*Salcer v. Merrill Lync, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc*‚Äù[7](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:7) the courts expressly suggest that the ‚Äú*investment* ***must*** *be part of a pooled group of funds*.‚Äù

And in ‚Äú*Milnarik v M-S Commodities*‚Äù[8](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:8) it is noted that ‚Äú*the success or failure of other contracts must have a direct impact on the profitability of plantiffs contracts*.‚Äù

Since our Ethereum is not pooled and a validators profit or penalty is derived solely from their performance and does not impact other validators, we can conclude there is not ‚Äú*Horizontal Commonality*.‚Äù  


### Vertical Commonality:

As outlined in ‚Äú*SEC v. Glenn W Turner Enters Inc*‚Äù[9](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:9) vertical commonality requires the investors profits are ‚Äú*tied inextricably to the efficacy of the promoter*‚Äù

In ‚Äú*Villeneuve v. Advanced Bus Concepts Corp*‚Äù[10](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:10) its noted that ‚Äú*the fortunes of investors need be linked only to the efforts of the promoter*‚Äù and in ‚Äú*Long v. Shultz Cattle Co*‚Äù[11](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:11) expanded to note that it requires only that the ‚Äú*fortunes of invesntors be tied to the fortunes of the promoters*.‚Äù

First there is the challenge that it is not likely that there is grounds to find that there is an ‚ÄúEthereum Promoter‚Äù any more under the definition of this role. Yet, that is novel legal precedent that would need to be tested.

Instead, if we assume the Ethereum creators were found to be ‚Äú*Promoters*‚Äù for sake of the arguement, then the question is if their fortune is directly tied to the fortunes of the ‚Äúinvestors.‚Äù

By contributing to Ethereum, developers do not expressly own part of the network unless they themselves purchased Ether. As such, they cannot be deemed to be a promoter.  


**Commonality**  


The only commonality arguement that exists is that there is some sort of ‚Äúcommon enterprise‚Äù among validators running the network, and a cooperative mechanic between validators validating a transaction. However, as those are distinct and post facto to the development of the networks code, these validators cannot sufficiently be found to be ‚Äúpromoters‚Äù in any established sense of the term.  


**Status:** Does not this Prong

## 3. An expectation of profit, derived from the efforts of others:

The final prong of the Howey Test is if the investor can have ‚Äú*an expectation of profit,* ***derived from*** *the efforts of others*.‚Äù

As outlined in ‚Äú[How Many Prongs Are In The Howey Test?](https://isethereumasecurity.com/ProngsOfHoweyTest.html)‚Äù it is important to note that this clause is a compound because:  


* Users are allowed to expect profit, and,
* The common enterprise may have efforts of others.
* But, the **profit** must not be derived from the efforts of others.

In ‚Äú*United Housing Foundation v. Forman*‚Äù[12](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:12) the courts expressly noted that the core of this is based ‚Äú*on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or mangerial efforts of others*.‚Äù

This requires that we must not only expect profit, but the profit we expect must be from the efforts of others and not be from our own efforts or goods.

In ‚Äú*US v. Holtzclaw*‚Äù[13](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:13) a church bought into a program to resell gold certificates from the ‚ÄúSell America‚Äù program, the courts found that a multi-level marketing program was not a security for the aggreved party, as they only earned from sales resulting from their own efforts.

While the ‚Äú*efforts of others*‚Äù were absolutely needed in order for their to be profit (Sell America had to acquire gold, issue certificates, create a system to sell and register those and redeem them) the profit expected did not stem from those efforts and **required** the efforts of the investor party to be selling.

As mentioned in the summary of [Ethereum Validation](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumValidation.html) and [Ethereum Rewards &amp; Penalties](https://isethereumasecurity.com/EthereumRewardsAndPenalties.html), we know that:

* Validators must use their own technical expertise to maintain adequate technology and uptime.
* Their validator is *only* rewarded when it takes part in validation.
* Their validator only earns a reward or penalty, for itself, based on its own actions.
* A validtor can increase their earnings, and only their earnings through implementing MEV strategies.
* Validators can increase their earnings by reporting bad validators in the set, making clear that the validator ‚Äúcommittee‚Äù is not a common enterprise with profits tied to each other, but instead an seperate and adverseral set of vendors.
* In theory a single validator could be rewarded if no other validator took part in the process, showing there is not a dependence on actions of others.  


Ultimately this prong of the Howey Test posits the question ‚Äú*What are you being rewarded for?*.‚Äù

In the Ethereum network, you as a validator are not rewarded on the basis that the Ethereum developers continue to develop.

Validators are selling ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù, they are rewarded for being available and accurate. We know this because a validator is [*slashed*](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#) when it has excessive downtime, or its trust becomes deficient and it is slashed on an individual level.

If we are rewarded for ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù and slashed when and only when we have either downtime or lose trust, then this must be what is for sale.

The question then becomes is the effort of maintaining that ‚Äú*reliable participation*‚Äù by maintaining a validator sufficient that we are being clearly rewarded for our own individual actions rather than the efforts of others?

We believe the SEC has indirectly answered that for us already in ‚Äú*SEC v. Homero Joshua Garza*‚Äù[14](https://isethereumasecurity.com/#fn:14) in which Garza was charged with violating section 5a of the Securities Law Act of 1933.

In this case, the SEC viewed that owning and managing Bitcoin mining rigs/servers *was* a managerial effort, and that selling access to their future earnings was therefore a matter of expectation of profit at the efforts of others and thus a security.

Therefore we believe it is undeniable that the maintaining of an Ethereum validator which has the additional burden and complexity of uptime and accuracy requirements, should also be viewed as the key managerial effort, and therefore does not meet this prong.  


**Status:** Does not this Prong

## Summary:

**Prong #2:**  


* Hard to suggest there is an ‚Äú*issuer*‚Äù or ‚Äú*promoter*‚Äù at this point in Ethereum.
* Staking does not have horizontal commonality in relation to profits.
* Staking does have some horizontal commonality in relation to other validators, but they are not an issuer/promoter.
* Horziontal commonality in efforts is negated by the factor that the profits and loses are solely based on your own validators performance and actions.
* Your validator can be taken to another network is not locked in to any type of commonality.
* Staking does not have strong vertical commonality with the issuer.
* There is only broad vertical commonality, if you believe what is being sold is blockspace, and that the blockspace is owned by developers who publish code, but do not run the network.

**Prong #3:**  


* There is an expectation of profits.
* Those profits are only derived from your own ability to maintain a reliable validator.
* The maintenance of a machine performing network validation has been shown to be a key managerial effort in the past.
* You are selling uptime and validation, and not blockspace, as your validator could connect to another PoS network, or fork, with other validators and do the same action.

This would mean finding Ethereum Proof-of-Stake to not be a security.

1573551248,0,1,"Hi, Traders ! **Monfex** is on the air !

**Ethereum preserves tight correlation with Bitcoin and is set to climb above $200 soon.**

[https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/x22RY1Wg-Ethereum-in-correlaion-with-Bitcoin/](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/x22RY1Wg-Ethereum-in-correlaion-with-Bitcoin/)

\* Ethereum has been following precisely Bitcoin‚Äôs price dynamic over the last several weeks. This correlation was easily visible when BTC had faced selling pressure lately,that forced the price down to $8,700.

\* As you can see from the right-hand chart, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent bearishness was closely replicated by Ethereum's price action.

\* Despite the recent bearishness, Ethereum has gone up in price significantly from its mid-term lows under $160 to the local highs around $200 level.

\* At the moment, ETH is setting up higher lows on H4 time-frame, preceding the potential upward impulse above $200.

\* Another bullish factor that could energize Ethereum‚Äôs bulls is the crypto‚Äôs network activity, which appears extremely strong recently, having processed in September the most activity in its history.

**Active trade signal**

Buy @ $183 - $187.

Nearest Target: $220.

Stop-loss: $173.

**GOOD LUCK AND LOTS OF PROFITS !!**

*(Ljubljana, 20 February 2020)* \- **CargoX**, the provider of the CargoX blockchain document transfer (BDT) platform, has been granted prestigious approval by the **International Group of P&amp;I Clubs** (IG P&amp;I). It has become the first and only approved provider to use the neutral, **public blockchain Ethereum network** for its platform.¬†

The International Group of P&amp;I Clubs is an unincorporated association of the 13 principal underwriting Protection &amp; Indemnity (P&amp;I) Associations (Clubs) and their Affiliated Associations and Reinsured Entity. Between them, they provide liability cover (protection and indemnity) for approximately 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage. Of the world‚Äôs top 25 reinsurers, 22 were featured on the group‚Äôs program in 2019.¬†

Ensuring ocean shipping resilience

*‚ÄúThe mutual club system has proved itself resilient and responsive for over 120 years. Future-proofing the group is not a novel concept, but it will be a key focus within the group going forward, and whilst looking ahead, the only certainty is uncertainty, the group, and its member clubs will be there to deliver the necessary solutions for their shipowners and to protect third-party interests,‚Äù* emphasized Mr. Paul Jennings, Chairperson of the IG P&amp;I, in the group annual review.

*‚ÄúCargoX is fully committed to building trust among partners in the supply chain industry in a trustless business world. Providing a fast, secure, and efficient way to transfer documents of title, and herewith the ownership of the transferred goods is of fundamental importance to global trade. We are proud to have been awarded the trust of such respectable institutions, members of the IG P&amp;I. We are looking forward to the future!‚Äù* said Stefan Kukman, founder and CEO of CargoX.¬†

Cautious steps of digitalization

The approval is a historic milestone for CargoX, and for the public blockchain community at large. Until February 2010, the rules of all the group‚Äôs clubs specifically excluded liabilities in respect of the shipping of cargo under all electronic (paperless) trading systems; on 20 February 2010 that all changed for the much better. Ten years later, in February 2020¬†the group approved CargoX, additionally to the electronic systems administered by ESS, Bolero, e-title‚Ñ¢, GlobalShare, and Wave.¬†

Of these electronic systems providers, only CargoX has built its Blockchain Document Transfer (BDT) Platform atop a neutral, public blockchain network, namely the Ethereum network, and uses the network‚Äôs advanced cryptographic features for original document creation, document ownership transfer, audit trail provisions, privacy, business confidentiality assurance, and document and transaction immutability.¬†

Carriers, shippers, consignees, endorses, banks, freight forwarders, and other parties can issue, exchange and sign¬†a variety of supply chain encrypted documents with no need for a central server or registry. ¬†The system is supported by a legal framework known as the Special Terms and Conditions (ST&amp;C) that facilitates the transfer and endorsement of electronic bills of lading. While the system removes the need for a paper bill,¬†there is scope to revert to paper where it is necessary to do so.

The solution incorporates and upgrades the usability concepts similar to email and banking transactions, effectively providing services that are superior to traditional paper document transfer.¬†

The operation of IG clubs

The IG P&amp;I formed in 1899 when the so-called London Group was formed, composed of 6 British P&amp;I mutual marine insurance associations whose job it was to insure British ships navigating the world. Today, there are 13 member associations, providing liability cover for approximately 90% of the world's ocean-going tonnage. Of the world‚Äôs top 25 reinsurers, 22 were featured in the group‚Äôs 2019 program.¬†

Each IG Club is an independent, non-profit making mutual insurance association, providing P&amp;I insurance cover for its shipowner and charterer members against third party liabilities relating to the use and operation of ships. Each Club is controlled by its members through a board of directors, or a committee elected from among the membership.

IG P&amp;I Clubs cover a wide range of liabilities, including loss of life and personal injury to crew, passengers, and others on board, cargo loss and damage, pollution by oil and other hazardous substances, wreck removal, collision, and damage to property. Clubs also provide a wide range of services to their members regarding claims handling, legal issues, and loss prevention, and often play a leading role in coordinating the response to, and management of, maritime casualties.

The IG P&amp;I has already notified its members of its approval of CargoX.¬†

We are the team behind [Molecule](https://catalyst.molecule.to/) and are working on decentralizing drug development to bring more diverse treatments to patients. In January, we launched the first version of our dApp and together with the [Toronto Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://www.psychedelicscience.ca/), we have created the first crowdfunding campaign using cryptocurrency to fund an official clinical trial on the effects of microdosing psilocybin.

You can contribute using [Dai](https://makerdao.com/) or most other ERC20 tokens through our integration with [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/). Funds are solely managed through our smart contract infrastructure and in return for your support you receive a unique token that increases in value when more people contribute.

Please help us bring psilocybin closer to patients and [DONATE](https://app.catalyst.molecule.to/project/5e202ad3e8755f001cc679a7). All proceeds go directly to the research team!

1585038789,1,1,"Hi all,

I'm building a tool for end-users to set up customized strategies (inputs) across different DeFi protocols into one transaction. As you may have heard about how people make a profit by using flashloan. Currently, if you want to make your own flashloan or simply just put different strategies into one transaction, you gotta know how to code to set up your own script. That's why i wanna build this tool. As this is sthg built for end-users, if would be very helpful to learn about how people would want to use it? 

Some scenarios I have in mind, (plz correct me if i'm wrong)

* Arbitrage between swapping services. 
* Create customized Zaps and combined them into one to save gas and steps.
* Save steps and gas: Swap and add into Uniswap liquidity pool in one transaction

What else have I missed?",ethtrader,What are some typical trading strategies you would use across different DeFi?

Thus, if I open a short position of 100ETH, there has to be somebody on the opposite side of the bet, right? If true, can that opposite side at some point withdraw causing my short position to be closed? For example, say I have shorted 100ETH, whilst B went 100ETH long, however market conditions turned south and B's stop loss is triggered, would this mean that my 100ETH short position be closed as well if there is nobody who could match it?",ethtrader,Can your short position be forcefully closed by an exchange?

1593246890,1,1,"Here‚Äôs part 6 of my thoughts and what I have learned after 3 years in the crypto space. Today‚Äôs topic will be much shorter and more meta.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The masses are almost inevitable and with the influx of newcomers, this community will evolve into whatever we make of it.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is more of a reminder and a call upon everyone in this community to welcome those who are new. I know that many of you will remember the great community in the r/ETHTrader daily back when ETH was $40 and below (except for maybe the fall from the high teens to $5.85 but bear markets are different). I personally don‚Äôt remember this as I didn‚Äôt join this community until we broke $200 for the first time. However, I do remember things deteriorating going from $200 to $1400. There was more noise, more spam and much more shilling. If we are to break our all-time high again, these same things will all be inevitable. However, we as a community can do something about this. We can keep the community friendly, helpful and welcoming to the new, inexperienced and sometimes confused investors who just stumbled upon ETH.

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs what you can do to keep this community healthy in the upcoming bull-run:

1. Be helpful and welcoming to anyone new. Don‚Äôt give toxic responses to seemingly obvious questions. We were all new and very confused by the ins and outs of both the technology and the investing aspect of ETH at some point. I remember being confused by people in the sub throwing about terms like ICO, whale and sharding. Well imagine what it‚Äôs like in 2020 with all of that plus DeFi, DApps, NFT,s smart wallets, ZK-rollups and much much more. Have a little compassion and understanding. Put yourself in the newcomer‚Äôs shoes and write a response which you would‚Äôve hoped for when you were new. If you can‚Äôt answer a question then perhaps upvote it so it gets enough visibility for someone else to come along and help out.
2. Use the report button if you see any toxicity or trolling. This makes the moderators‚Äô job of keeping discussion in the sub civil much easier. If someone is clearly trolling, it is often easier to report their comment than it is to engage with them.
3. If you disagree with someone, that‚Äôs ok. Explain to them why you disagree but remember that we all have different perspectives on things and respect that. I often find when I disagree with someone it‚Äôs because one of us has had an experience which the other has not or we have different core values or end goals due to being very different people. When you realise this, being right is less important since you know that sometimes things are subjective and not everything can be objectively right or wrong. It‚Äôs ok to agree to disagree. Just don‚Äôt let a disagreement devolve into insults. It achieves nothing. (***Sidenote:*** *I have found that this community is much better than other crypto communities for this and I hope we can keep it this way!)*
4. If you have information which you feel could benefit others in the sub, share it! We all love lurking sometimes or doing nothing more than shitposting and meming. But the best way to help the community is to put out some quality content to help others who haven‚Äôt had the same experiences or learned from the same resources you have. This is the content which educates new investors to make wise choices and to see ETH for what it is - a revolutionary technology with meaningful use and meaningful adoption. Without this content the ETH community would have nothing to separate itself from all of the scammy and shitty cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

The genuinely useful technology and the genuinely helpful community is what separates us from the rest and it will play a major role in our future success. So be kind to each other and help each other out on this learning and investing opportunity of a lifetime which is ahead of us.",ethtrader,"""The masses are coming and this community will evolve into what we make of it"" - What I have learned after 3 years in crypto.

ETH fees are WAY too high right now, Mew wallet on devices can't even make transactions at some times because you can't set the gas above default. 

I've had several failed transactions in the last few days and any notion of using ETH as a computational layer for a widely used app is prohibitively expensive right now.

THIS IS THE BEST NEWS EVER. 


Eth is a computer ! If a computer is overused while being slow and expensive imagine how successful it's going to be when it's fast and cheap !!

This could be the birth of a whole new way to compute, not just for financial apps but for every app.",ethtrader,ETH transaction fees are too high and it's the best news ever

LOL, so it seems making money in crypto is no longer about triangles and new exciting tech but money-making reciepe goes like this:

1. Go to the list of DEFI coins on Coingecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/pl/defi](https://www.coingecko.com/pl/defi)
2. Find a coin that has market cap in the 1-5 million range (sub 1 million market caps coins will probably fail, 5 million and above are already to crowdy, 2-3 million is optimum). Those are usually below top 50 coins.
3. Buy that deficoin on balancer or uniswap (or yeld if it yealdable)
4. Wait a week or two. It pumps to 20 million market cap or sometimes even 200 million.
5. PROFIT
6. Repeat XD

Edit: this is not an endorsement. Just trying to catch the zeitgeist for the generations to come. That's how we used to make money on crypto back in 2020. XD",ethtrader,"How to find the next big defi project explained (joke, but it works - until it does not)"

Eth has a consistent high trading volume, but link has only 1B+ volume when it pumps really hard. Eth seems now to be more fare valued than Link. Also eth is already a mature network, meanwhile link still has to implement reputation and penalties(staking) for their node operators. So it‚Äôs still in development.

1605256274,1,1," First, I looked for a pair with good volatility. I found BID, CREAM, and ORAI to have good volatility and placed Cycle orders on all 3 pairs.

Generally, tokens with low liquidity and high volume work well in this instance. You can use this link to do your research: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/uniswap

https://preview.redd.it/pi3bbolwwyy51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d4bd63e4a0149fc8af4fd98515e645384bd88c

 Make sure it is sorted as 24/hr Volume.

When selecting pairs, make sure you are selecting something you are ‚Äúokay‚Äù to hold for a while if the trade goes out of range. Do not attempt cycles on absolute shit coins. As per my experience, you should start with something like 4 to 5 WETH (1 ETH = 1 WETH).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/da3tmkv0xyy51.png?width=494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86a8fbe6701c686a77ae1a4d54563aec85b8b201

 

These were the settings I used. You may wonder about the 1% volatility and 3% slippage setting used here, but that‚Äôs the very thing that worked throughout. In most cases, you end up getting more than 1% each time. Don't worry about the caution sign, but keep a watch out for the first couple of trades. If it is profitable, then continue with the same process. If you feel it is not profitable, then you will need to up the volatility percentage or reduce the slippage. Also you can mimic the same order on Uniswap and see if everything is all right. UniDexBot has a Telegram notifications alert system when a trade happens.

Gas cost in each transactions stay around 0.01 ETH. Out of the 3 trades I set, I saw ORAI doing really well and getting more hits. This is still ongoing. At the moment of this writing, this is what it's showing me:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/04bbobt1xyy51.png?width=428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea59a489fdb4752b879c51baa99d82a99d13c80

 After trade #5, I became bag holder of ORAI for a few days since it had a 50% dip. For some reason, the trade was paused then. When I looked after about 9 days, I was in profit and made a Market trade. 

https://preview.redd.it/q5es4zu7xyy51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6003586b2d636b2edbe8d3d25a30c136bdcf8417

 And in the next 3 days, I hit back to back trades on the WETH/ORAI pair. After trade #22, the pair went slightly out of range, and I edited the Cycle to settle with less ORAI than earlier. My aim in this Cycle strategy was to increase the WETH count. If I had not made amends, then I would not have hit more Cycles and doubled the WETH. 

https://preview.redd.it/i1cm5n2axyy51.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f923e57d57479c1086f83d3645ffc7c64cd07b3f

 Upcoming feature ‚Äî ***Trail stop loss***

I am really looking forward to this upcoming feature of ***UniDexBot.*** Then we can be saved from sudden dips from highs. This will help to preserve profits and may again hit more Cycles while triple or quadrupling your WETH. WETH is not the only token you can increase like this. You can use literally any token like DAI, USDC, WBTC etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\#What‚Äôs Changing With ETH 2.0?

&amp;#x200B;

1. \*\*Sharding:\*\* Sharding will upgrade the existing Ethereum blockchain (which you can imagine as a one lane road) to a blockchain made of 64 parallel parts, known as shards. Think of these 64 shards as a 64 lane highway, each lane has the same capacity as the original single lane road which is Ethereum 1.0.
2. \*\*Proof of Stake:\*\* Ethereum 2.0 will move Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake. In a nutshell, proof of work is a system where people have to essentially waste electricity, proving they have done work and put effort/money into securing the blockchain. This makes it hard for one person to overtake the network because it would be extremely expensive to burn all that power. Proof of stake requires people who secure the network or ""validators"" to put up ETH as collateral as a ""stake"" in the network. If they help secure the network, they will earn ETH but if they act maliciously they can be penalised in the form of losing some of their staked ETH (known as slashing). Much like proof of work, proof of stake makes it hard for one person to overtake the network because they would need to buy a very large number of ETH, making the attack unrealistically expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many pros and cons to proof of stake vs proof of work but Ethereum's implementation of proof of stake will make Ethereum more secure, more efficient and environmentally friendly (by using less power) and it will result in less inflation since the people securing the network don't need to be compensated monetarily for the electricity they used to secure the network.

&amp;#x200B;

\#ETH 2.0 Phases

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*ETH 2.0 is rolling out in multiple phases. These are:\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

* \*\*Phase 0:\*\* This is the introduction of Proof of Stake and the creation of the ETH 2.0 blockchain. This is the backbone of the ETH 2.0 system. Imagine it like the foundation upon which the 64 lane road is being built. It is a wide flat foundation of rock and it is not connected to the existing Ethereum 1 road. While there are no cars driving on this chain yet (there are no transactions on this chain), people are able to move from the Ethereum 1 road and onto this new road. The people moving over are security guards making sure that the foundation of the road remains secure and ready for upgrading once the developers are ready to build out the rest of the road.
* \*This is what the deposit contract and staking talk right now is about, you can move your 32 ETH in the deposit contract which will move your 32 ETH to the foundation of the ETH 2.0 road (known as the beacon chain) where you can stake your ETH and keep the road secure and ready for a future upgrade. In return these people get paid out a variable % interest on their 32 ETH for their service.\*
* \*\*Phase 1:\*\* This is construction of 63 of the lanes on the new road. However, these lanes aren't open to the public yet. They are only to be used by public transport so most people are still using the Ethereum 1 road, but if people decide to use public transport (a certain layer 2 solution known as a roll-ups), we can decrease the congestion on the Ethereum 1 road.
* \*In technical terms, this is where 63 new shards which are connected to the beacon chain are created. These shards aren't available for transactions yet but they do hold data on the state of the Ethereum blockchain. This data can be used by transactions which use the layer 2 scaling solution known as roll-ups, reducing load on ETH 1.\*
* \*\*Phase 1.5:\*\* This is when we say goodbye to having two separate roads. The Ethereum 1 lane is merged with the ETH 2.0 road, creating a 64 lane highway. However, the other 63 lanes are still closed to certain traffic (specifically which traffic is still to be determined). Now that cars are moving on the new road, the security guards (ETH 2.0 validators) are now free to get back in their cars if they want to (or they can keep staking) and new ETH is no longer created to pay for the security of the old road.
* \*This phase sees the Ethereum 1 chain become a shard on ETH 2, moving it over to proof of stake and connecting it to the other 63 shards. The other shards are not yet able to take all types of transactions yet such as complex transactions which interact with smart contracts (these are the type of transactions you send when using DeFi apps like creating a Maker Vault). Now that the Ethereum 1 chain has moved into its own ETH 2 shard, it is secured by proof of stake and we no longer need to mint new ETH to pay miners to secure the network which happens under proof of work. As a result, the inflation rate of ETH will drop from around 5% annually to around 1% annually (or possibly even going negative thanks to the proposed fee burn and fee market upgrade EIP-1559).
* \*\*Phase 2:\*\* This is the grand opening of all 64 lanes of the highway. All or almost all traffic will be able to use any lane (the specifics have not yet been determined, certain transactions may have to use certain lanes). The maximum capacity of the Ethereum highway will increase approximately 64x over its current capacity - and that‚Äôs not including the effect of public transport (layer 2 scaling solutions) in increasing the number of people who can use this highway in their daily lives! Also, there is no theoretical limit to the number of lanes the highway has. If certain parameters are tweaked and as technology advances, we may be able to add more lanes to the highway if it is deemed necessary.
* \*This phase is the last phase for a feature complete ETH 2.0. All or many of the 64 shards will allow for smart contract execution and transactions (it is possible that not all shard will be used for all types of transactions. This is yet to be determined). Another big feature which will ship with this phase is the introduction of eWASM which will replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This will allow developers to code smart contracts in languages other than Solidity, thus greatly increasing the number of people who can build on Ethereum. Finally, phase 2 will also introduce execution environments. Unfortunately this goes beyond my level of knowledge and expertise but basically it allows for more customisations and possibilities for developers.\*

\#The All Important Question: When?

&amp;#x200B;

I realise that I haven‚Äôt put in any timelines above as there aren‚Äôt any official ones. However, it is important to keep in mind that development of the different phases is happening in parallel, meaning that just because phase 1 hasn‚Äôt shipped yet doesn‚Äôt mean that phase 2 isn‚Äôt already under development. Each phase is currently being worked on. This also means that a delay in phase 0 or phase 1 may not delay the release of phase 2. I have also heard it said that phase 0 is the most complex and it has almost launched as I type this! If I had to guess, I would expect 1-1.5 years per upgrade, putting the full phase 2 launch release between late 2022 and 2024. But like literally everyone in the ETH community, I truly have no idea what the real timeline will look like and it is important to emphasise that Ethereum is not entirely reliant on ETH 2.0 for scaling as we have many other scaling solutions live now or releasing soon, some of which will benefit from the early phases of ETH 2.0 as I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

if this doesn‚Äôt go in depth enough for you, I recommend checking out some of the resources on ETHHub. They covered ETH 2.0 here: [https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Also, please let me know if I got anything wrong! I am not an expert, just an Ethereum enthusiast and my expertise is more in the financial side of Ethereum than the technical side. I will gladly make any corrections if I got anything wrong.\*\*",ethtrader,An Easy to Understand Introduction to ETH 2.0 and its Different Phases.

So in summary - GTHE roadmap is pretty comprehensive - teleconsultation, specialty care, chronic care, disease management, pharmacy services, device purchasing, automated data collection, social intervention, home care, long term care. Step by step, we plan to move most of healthcare delivery services onto GTHE. We need to capture the big piece of healthcare and make it work better using blockchain powered SOLVE token and care networks

1. GTHE is an open network, where any doctor can see any patient, any patient can see any doctor. Teledoc is a closed network where patients need to be authorized to join

We have made a priority of making SOLVE available in large exchange and trading platforms around the world. This is one of key 2021 priority. The process of listing varies and there is no way to give a fixed date. We will announce as soon as listing is confirmed (if the exchange allows us to announce).

1608979586,0,1," **Welcome to reverse engineered DeFi, sustainability, legitimized anonymity, unlimited scalability and unlimited funding potential.** ***Welcome to the DEFLECT platform.***

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img jsfv3pimgi761...*

The ***Deflect*** Protocol is *an industry-first solution that brings unlimited scalability, funding potential, and gas-less redistribution of tokens, all under one platform*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deflect (DEFLCT, Contract Address:** 0x3aa5f749d4a6bcf67dac1091ceb69d1f5d86fa53) utilizes the following tokenomics/distribution model:

*‚Ä¢ Max Supply - 500,000*

*‚Ä¢ Percentage of Transaction Re-Distribution - 1.5%*

*‚Ä¢ Percentage of Transaction Burn Rate - 0.75%*

*‚Ä¢ Percentage of Transaction Deflect Treasury - 0.25%*

&amp;#x200B;

***Deflect*** enables DeFi startups with white-label solutions and launchpads for custom tailored smart-contracts with tokenomics functionality around liquidity provision, yield farming, and compounding interest-based lock-ups.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w23ri7kngi761.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f77f26128b52d46faae768ac4f147bbd174c8292

***Product Outline:***

***Deflect*** brands as an Integration Platform and Launchpad that provides solidity expertise, smart-contract-oriented tokenomics as well as ecosystem mechanics advisory, ecosystem maintenance, and support to third projects.

The Ecosystems Smart-Contract support encourages and empowers initiatives by helping build projects with their own native smart-contract ecosystems while providing a LGE (*Liquidity Generating Event*) Platform for new projects as a fair-launch program that also gives sub-Ethereum DeFi communities a safer alternative to Pre-Sale mechanisms.

&amp;#x200B;

***But how does the LGE Launchpad work?***

Considering projects that are launching on the ***DEFLCT*** platform are generally expected to lock liquidity (***ETH, in 99.9% of instances***) like most other legitimate projects since the locked liquidity idea was conceptualized, they are eligible to claim unlocked pairs tied to ***DEFLCT***, which are subject to ***Deflect***'s in-house liquidity farming ecosystem. Third-Parties will be able to access and utilize ***Deflect***'s numerous ecosystem templates and designs. In addition, they will be able to set their own variables such as Supply, Mechanics, Functionality, Utility, Allocations, Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Our Conditions are outlined below when offering Solidity power to launchpad projects:

\- The team at Deflect will build the token contracts and LGE contracts, deploy LGE's, then transfer ownership of third-party developer to overtaking third-party.

\- Launchpad token contracts will be built by Deflect Development team with ETH Liquidity Perma-Locked (in the same essence as CORE) with no MINT functions or proxies. With this strategy, all launch projects are 100% protected from exit scams and rug-pulls. Funds are SAFU.

\- A Minimum of 5% of total supply (in this instance the launchpad token) is sent to the ***DEFLCT*** treasury as a Development cost.

\- A minimum of 10% of total supply (in this instance the launchpad token) is sent to the ***DEFLCT/ETH LP*** pair for farming.

\- A minimum of 10% of total supply (in this instance the launchpad token) is sent to the DEFLCT/NEWTOKEN LP for farming.

\- Third-Party launchpad project's will allocate 65% of the remaining supply to their specifications (*LGE, more pools, launchpad token treasury, their own strategies, personal team tokens, etc., as long as all of the information regarding the distribution of the supply is stated openly and pre-allocated for full disclosure and transparency for the community)*

\- All launchpad token liquidity farming pools must be hosted on Deflectprotocol.io (third-parties can have a UI plug in to the smart-contract on their own site also)

\- There will be some dynamic variables here from project to project depending on the complexity and time-frame of each individual project needs.

\- Optional re-auditing of launchpad tokens updated variables and tokenomics via our auditing partners (Certik is partnered with Deflect to audit projects utilizing their platform)

&amp;#x200B;

***Business Model:***

Spendable assets within the ***Deflect*** ecosystem are external tokens that go to the ***Deflect*** treasury. These tokens are spent with zero sell pressure within the ***Deflect*** ecosystem.

External tokens accumulated in the treasury will also be allocated to fund expansion within the ***Deflect*** ecosystem by *diversifying the ecosystems portfolio and building future decentralized index funds along with portfolio management lending/borrowing systems with revolutionary spendable multipliers that increase your risk VS. reward ratio.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Phase 1 Utility:**

‚Ä¢ **LP Staking pools:** Earn returns from a variety of strategies and yields by farming with *DEFLECT/ETH LP* or *DEFLECT/PARTNER LP*.

‚Ä¢ **Deflect / Ethereum Liquidity Providers:** *DEFLCT/ETH LP* providers get exclusive access to 10% of the supply of Launchpad projects.

‚Ä¢ **Gas-less Re-distribution:** With ***Deflect***, Rewards to network holders direct to their wallets without claiming or staking. Truly a natively inversed fractional reserve based medium of exchange and store of value that this platform and protocol is built on top of.

‚Ä¢ **Fractionally Inversed &amp; Deflationary:** The Deflect in your wallet compounds gas-less and frictionless interest on every transaction, so your wallet increases in supply whilst the supply around your wallet is Decreasing. Whilst with your bank, the money in your wallet stays the same, but the supply around your wallet is increasing. Making your money less valuable.

Deflect gives its perma-locked Liquidity providers an innovative utility of passive income by allocation of 10% of all launchpad projects total supply is farmed via the DEFLCT/ETH LP pair.

First things first, CMC has a page for DeFi Automated Market Maker projects now. I'm not talking about their page where they list DeFi related tokens, but rather the page where they list more info on each DeFi platform. They named that page '[yield farming](https://coinmarketcap.com/yield-farming/)'.  

The problem is that CMC's page is that it gives out a wrong image about the DeFi economy's size. There's a ton of problems with CMC's page and there's no point mentioning everything, but just a couple of simple examples. First of all, they don't include Uniswap at all. Secondly, total value locked stats are off by a lot also. 

For more accurate aggregate statistics you should either go to each project's homepage itself, where you can also see APR estimations for providing liquidity to each pair.

December 02, 2017 ‚Äî Vipul Goyal, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) who teaches graduate courses on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, predicts that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency. In an interview with [howstuffworks](https://money.howstuffworks.com/beyond-bitcoin-next-big-cryptocurrency.htm), he added that the drastic increase in new ICOs will soon stabilize, resulting in only ‚Äúa few dozen in circulation‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy personal prediction is that Ethereum will end up becoming the biggest cryptocurrency,‚Äù Goyal said.

Goyal said that Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency, as it is primarily a platform enabling various applications to run on blockchain securely. This sets it apart from Bitcoin, whose only objective is to replace traditional currency. Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain infrastructure is therefore said to be more ‚Äúpowerful and versatile‚Äù, allowing for a wide array of use cases (apart from currency and payments) on its platform.",ethtrader,Professor at CMU Predicts Ethereum Will Overtake Bitcoin as The Number One Cryptocurrency

Dear all,

I am an information systems student at the University of Zurich and currently writing my bachelor thesis on blockchain governance and interest alignment. Within this thesis, I work towards a framework about different stakeholder interests in public and permissionless blockchain projects and created a survey to evaluate this framework.

In this regard, if you are in any way involved in such public blockchain projects (e.g. investing, mining, developing service tools, ...), I would very much appreciate your participation in that survey.

Survey Link: [https://www.uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/967815?lang=en](https://www.uzh.ch/zi/cl/umfragen/index.php/967815?lang=en)

The survey takes **no more than 10 minutes** and is conducted anonymously. Should there be any questions or remarks, please do not hesitate to contact me. Also, feel free to share this link with others!

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Kind regards

Highlights:

* Ethereum blockchain developers approved **one of the biggest changes to the network since its inception in 2015**, a shift that could **spur even bigger gains** in the price of its native cryptocurrency Ether.
* The move will **reduce the amount of outstanding Ether** by destroying some of the tokens every time it‚Äôs used to fuel transactions on the world‚Äôs most-used blockchain. 
* **Known as** [**EIP 1559**](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/06/16/eth1x-1559/)**, the change solves a current problem**: Ethereum users can only estimate how much Ether will be needed for transactions to be processed, a guessing game that has spawned sites such as [ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) to help people know how much to pay. 
* The **reduced supply of Ether will likely lead to rising prices** as demand for the coins increases, said Eric Turner, director of research at Messari, a cryptocurrency analytics firm.
* The proposal also will change a strange feature in Ethereum that no one really saw coming. Users can now pay an Ethereum miner to process their transaction with a credit card or another cryptocurrency, undermining Ether‚Äôs role in its own blockchain, Beiko said. **EIP 1559 makes Ether the only way to pay for transactions on the network.**",ethtrader,"Crypto Coin Outperforming Bitcoin Is About to See Supply Reduced (Yes, its ETH !)"

The Clever DeFi project does not have a platform for the provision of decentralized financial services, as is the case in other projects. The Clever DeFi project does not have a platform, for example, for arbitrage trading or for transactions.

The Clever DeFi project has the only platform dedicated to the decentralized issuance of additional CLVA tokens and the subsequent decentralized distribution of CLVA tokens as a reward for the wallets of existing token holders.

Thus, the project intends to provide profit to CLVA holders by adding only additional CLVA to their balance sheet. At the same time, real profit, for example, in relation to any stable tokens, can be provided only by increasing the demand for this token, maintaining the CLVA price, attracting new holders. The new buyer of the CLVA token will automatically support the CLVA price (or increase the price). There is no demand for CLVA (no new investment), this means that the price of CLVA is automatically reduced.

This means that ensuring real profitability for the investment in the Clever DeFi project can only be achieved by increasing demand for the CLVA token through new users and additional purchases of CLVA by existing users.

- For what is arguably the most important conference for a $2 tn industry this year there was scant attendance. Most of the stream had only 100 viewers, with Vitalik's final presentation ""spiking"" to 300-500. Meanwhile, the $2 tn walled garden fruity corporation's keynote drew millions of viewers earlier in the week. We are so, so early.

- Everyone was coy about timelines, except Tomasz (Nethermind) surprisingly let slip a target for October 2021. Reading between the lines, I speculate the target is indeed Q4 2021, but everyone's waiting to see how the Rayonism multi-client devnets play out. There's a small chance Shanghai goes before The Merge, which delays it to Q1 2022.

- Most clients are ready for Rayonism. The code changes for the Merge is relatively simple and most clients will be done in weeks, not months. Much of the remaining work is testing, testing, auditing, and more testing. Danny expects official multi-client testnets to commence in a couple of months.

- The ""Ethereum 2.0"" branding or ""Eth2"" nomenclature is no more, and going forward it is all just one Ethereum. The two layers are now called execution layer (formerly eth1) and consensus layer (formerly eth2). So, if you see people talk about ""Eth2"", please correct them. Bonus: harp on about false sequentiality and make Danny proud.

- While the beacon chain seems to be much delayed, the actual engineering and implementation was completed in only 2 years - a remarkable achievement given it took that long for EIP-1559 (a much simpler upgrade) to make it to mainnet. Hsiao-Wei had a fascinating opening talk about how research is iterative and a lot of seemingly wasted time in 2016-18 strongly informed sound decisions for the actual implementations.

- Client diversity is key. Vouch is a very interesting solution that builds redundancy and diversity for validators.

- Both execution layer and consensus layer clients will continue developing in parallel after The Merge, but we may see some synergies, packaging innovations etc. Since Consensys develops clients from both layers, we may end up with a single ""Beku"" client. (I forget who made that joke - Trent? - it as a good one!)

- While solo staking requires 32 ETH, there'll be a ton of innovation to bring various types of delegated staking with varying magnitudes of decentralization/centralization. It's imperative we get people to move away from Coinbase/Binance/Kraken and onto these more decentralized options. Personally, I'd like to see a protocol where people can run their own validators for 1 ETH or so, making it more of distributed validation rather than delegated validation. No idea how this can be done, but someone will figure it out...

- MEV will live on after The Merge, or rather, VEV. Of course, given there are far more validators and entities involved - 120,000 versus a few dozen mining pools - we'll need new ways to organize things. But the Flashbots team are already working on it. I think we'll need a lot of coordination and ensure most validators are running VEV extraction solutions to ensure the community extracts the value and not opportunistic frontrunners.

- Secret shared validators are live on testnet!

- Alright, after The Merge... first we'll see cleanup fork soon after which will also enable withdrawals.

- Next step is data sharding, which would be the significant feature focus after The Merge. Simultaneously, the execution layer teams will work on Shanghai and Cancun. Data sharding will bring 25x scale to rollups and other L2 solutions that choose to leverage the massive data availability. First we'll have committee-based consensus, with the innovative data availability sampling coming later. Speculation: I'd expect data sharding to go live by late 2022, with DAS in 2023.

- Parallel to sharding, the key execution layer upgrade will be statelessness + state expiry. The current plan is to do them together. Post-state expiry, we'll have static expired states, which would be fairly easy to distribute - could even use IPFS or BitTorrent. There can be protocols to make the UX simple. This will be significant breakthrough for how blockchains work and will enable much higher gas limits and scaling on L1.

- EVMX - 384-bit EVM, and other continuous improvements. Vitalik discusses the many drawbacks of WASM, and believes we can get EVMX to a point where it has most of the functionality of WASM without any of the drawbacks. RIP eWASM. My personal opinion: We'll see rapid innovation with VMs on L2 and a lot of the learnings can then be implemented back on to L1.

- The final piece of the puzzle is SNARK-ing everything! After that, STARK-ing everything for post-quantum. This will make native execution on shards easier. Interestingly, this was the only time Vitalik even mentioned execution on shards, and ""if desired"". He's very confident about rollups. Speculation: we aren't going to see execution on shards using the prior fraud proof mechanisms ever, and we'll turn on execution only when it's done right. There'll be significant innovation around interoperability and communication between L2s, which will inform how executable shards work. Finally, CBC Casper for a more secure consensus mechanism. These upgrades are 3-5 years out. Beyond this, Ethereum L1 will achieve its final form and might go into ""maintenance mode"" middle of the decade with all of the innovation moving to L2.

There's a lot more, but these are my important takeaways.

In short, Ethereum remains the only project that's even attempting to solve the blockchain trilemma with innovative cryptographic techniques. Bitcoin has given up on scalability, while all other L1 protocols have given up on decentralization and/or security. I should note that rollups can also be considered as solutions to the trilemma - Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync 2.0 and StarkNet are the true ""Ethereum killers"". This will become evident over the next 5 years.

1619596738,1,1,"Ethereum broke out bigly on Tuesday, printing an impulsive bullish candle above the $2,500 level and up to $2,700, closing the daily candle around $2,625. This is extremely bullish as ETH has broken out of its $500 range and above a resistance level that stood in the way between ETH and $3,000

Short-Term:

ETH broke out against the USD and Bitcoin, reaching a new USD high and rallying to over 0.048 ETH/BTC, its highest level since August 2018. There was some turbulence around 0.045 but once ETH broke above it it ran with it. ETH is now only a few hundred dollars away from the $3,000 level which is its immediate price target in USD and will surely offer some resistance. However, the more important resistance level to watch is 0.05 ETH/BTC, a major psychological level and the halfway marker back to 0.1 ETH/BTC.

ETH has gone an impressive run but I would be surprised to see ETH break above 0.05 in the short-term, as Bitcoin has been recovering nicely and consolidating for possibly another run up which would likely take some wind out from behind ETH. This should come as no surprise as there are no major impetuses right now for ETH until the London hard fork scheduled for June. It is likely between now and then that ETH will consolidate in anticipation of ETH's widely anticipated EIP-1559 possibly resulting in a deflationary monetary system.¬†

I expect ETH to find resistance around 0.05 and likely get rejected, resulting in a retracement to the 0.045 level or possibly even 0.04 where it should find support. From there, ETH/BTC will have formed another higher high and higher low and will wait for its turn to run after Bitcoin's next wave up. We are progressing nicely but remember, alts tend to have most of their gains last in bull market cycles, so by that measure ETH likely is just building up for a parabolic run in late 2021 or early 2022, much like 2017-2018.

This news (not often discussed), makes one very bullish about ETH!

If this is not mega bullish, I don't know what is!

# 1) Recap: EIP-1559 (July) will burn base fee, making ETH potentially deflationary

[See Diagram here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/n2kxyc/mega_bullish_eip1559s_main_effects_lower_eth/) to understand EIP-1559 in one glance (for new beginners).

Is that not good enough for you? No worries, Vitalik is about to make it BETTER!

# 2) Vitalik is proposing Exponential EIP-1559, burning Exponential amount of ETH

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, the Base fee (to be burned) is the vertical height of the triangle you see above. The curve is an exponential function, meaning the gradient gets steeper and steeper to the right (we can either use basic calculus or just observe from the diagram).

Hence, as gas price gets higher, the triangle moves more to the right, the more Base Fee gets burnt!

# 3) Exponential EIP-1559 Burns even more ETH than Regular EIP-1559

* Under this new proposal tokens will burn even faster than the planned 1559 rollout
* During high demand periods, gas will be more expensive, and more ETH will be burned
* **It's a proposal for a future improvement. It's far too late to make significant modifications to the EIP 1559 that's happening in July now. (Vitalik said this)**

1621322326,0,1,"When I first heard about Forex trading around 2004, (this was before crypto trading existed) I was immediately intrigued and fascinated.  Every day, for what seems like endless hours, I caught myself daydreaming and thinking about the idea itself and wondering, ‚ÄúWhat does it really mean?‚Äù or ‚ÄúDoes this shit really work?‚Äù  Let‚Äôs say in theory, a person gains some kind of skill or knowledge on how to outsmart the market and through this extraordinary skill, that person is then able to enter trades in what we are told is a global 6 trillion dollar liquid per day market (at that time it was 3 trillion) and be able to get profit from the trades.  Hopefully, the winning trades happen at least a higher percentage of time than the trades that don‚Äôt work out, right? And that‚Äôs reasonable to expect and doable by an average person, right?  (Ok.  Imagine going back in time to the point before you knew that almost know one ever achieves this and instead, enjoy the naivety and optimism you have for your newly discovered entrepreneurial project.)

Even a beginner can feel what it‚Äôs like to have a winning trade and that‚Äôs what gets us hooked on the addiction or in more positive terminology we could call it ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù or ‚Äúpassion‚Äù in Tony Robbins lingo. Yes, some would say it‚Äôs a delusional folly based on irrational exuberance. And if there is some special way to put the odds in your favor to have more winning than losing trades it seems like that would do the trick.  It seems like only a slight tweak or adjustment to most people‚Äôs trading strategies would activate the tipping point that puts them into the category of winning with consistent increase in capital.  I found plenty of reasons to be positive and optimistic about this project.  Later, I learned that some professionals had fewer winning trades than losing ones but the losing trades were really small and the winning trades were really big comparatively so it ends up creating a consistent increase in capital.  

Ok right.  I get it. But for me, I would prefer to actually know how to enter trades that win a high percentage of time in order to even feel like any increase would be legitimate.   I learned much later that even this belief is caused by unconscious core beliefs that limit success in trading but that‚Äôs a story for a later time. Still this desire for perfectionism, minimizing mistakes is part of what drove me to discover what works in trading. It has to be based on what I see is true about the market.  If I can see something is true and not base any trading strategy on something someone told me to do, then I know the probability is based on knowledge and skill and can be considered scientific to an extent. 

And then, the question arose, how much can a person make from trading?  This is a question that really enthralled me to the point of keeping me lying awake at night with wheels turning in my mind about how I would open my laptop for a few minutes at the beach, setting down my virgin margarita (limeade), and make a trade or two and seeing another $50,000 profit in my trading business, which of course, would be a simple easy and massively profitable enterprise. 

If the term ‚Äúrude awakening‚Äù is appropriate for how to describe what actually happened later, that process was not a rude awakening of one day, it was drawn out over months and years of disappointment and struggle. But let‚Äôs not go there just yet because if this story leads to any discovery of a way to trade and actually get profit consistently, at least it has a happy ending and my sharing of ways to bypass the ridiculously excruciating trial and error that has happened along the way will be a way to really help a few people to not have to waste nearly as much time and money. 

The amount of wasted money on trading products like courses, software, and seminars has made me a bit of an activist on traders' consumer rights leading to expose some outright scams and deceptions that are so prevalent in the trading world especially in Forex and crypto. After a while, a person can spot the charlatons who have popped up in the Forex niche, people who have never traded successfully but are professional marketers who needed a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù and were stumped about what to offer the ‚Äúcourse junkies‚Äù and software addicts in this buying frenzied crowd of newbies as well as seasoned enthusiasts searching for some legitimate way to earn money from what is believed to be an honest skill like being a bricklayer, an architect, or chef. 

I have met many people who take up Forex trading in the hope of creating a part time side hustle income of something like an extra $1000 per month.  And let‚Äôs face it, most of us come from working class backgrounds and have a mindset of searching for some income that is enough to pay our living expenses. 

There is a HUGE problem with that idea.  If you believe you can earn consistent profit in trading and you intend to use that skill to make a thousand dollars and then AFTER you spend a few years gaining that skill, you use it by taking out your capital to make sure it never increases so that you limit yourself to ONLY getting $1000 per month, that would not make any sense.  If you ever do get this extraordinary skill you have gained the power to create an income of any amount and make as much wealth as you desire. Trading is not a side hustle.  If you master it you will become wealthy.  If you somehow force yourself to not allow your account to increase in any normal sensible way, it is possible to stop yourself from getting wealthy if you really want that. But that would be like owning a 5 star hotel but only allowing yourself to keep for yourself a receptionist‚Äôs salary. 

Not only would it never make sense for any trader who knows how to trade to use that skill to make one or two thousand dollars for paying bills, since we all unconsciously know that to be true it is the source of much of the inner conflicts that prevent traders from being able to trade.  If you don‚Äôt know by now, no matter what trading strategy you use and no matter how advanced your understanding of technical analysis is, the results that all traders get are mostly due to unconscious core beliefs.  If you‚Äôre not aware that‚Äôs true, try typing some keywords into Google and reading a book or two on personal development or psychology. Soon you will run into plenty of proof regarding that fact. 

Trading is not a hobby and not a part time side project.  If you master it, you are wealthy. Period. The unconscious limiting core beliefs that cause people to believe they can earn a couple of thousand dollars from trading and use it to pay their bills, keeps them from ever realizing any mastery in trading.  ‚ÄúOh, but I don‚Äôt want to be one of those greedy rich people!‚Äù  This belief stops traders dead in their tracks from ever getting mastery of trading and because the conflict is *unconscious*, most will never know what the real problem is. 

**The Purpose or Intention of This Journey**

That‚Äôs what this story is about.  How to get to the bottom of whether there is a way to trade with a high enough probability and not fuck it up with psychological sabotage like suddenly feeling an anxiety attack that shuts off function of the frontal lobes of the brain while trying to remain calm and wise about trading decisions. And for the first step on this journey I have found that getting clear about your purpose for even going on this journey will help to form a clear map that you will create and/or discover for leading you to the goal of using your own knowledge and skill to earn consistent profit that will become any amount you can imagine.  If you succeed in mastering this skill, It‚Äôs just a matter of knowing how much time it will take for your account to increase to be the amount you want it to be. 

A valuable exercise to get you going is to get a notebook to use as a trading journal and another one to use as a personal development journal and write down your intention for what you hope to attain through learning to trade with excellence.  How will your life change when you have this skill you seek?  Will you use this skill to help others and participate in some form of philanthropy?  Do you have a mission that requires you to have this skill and this wealth that is for the benefit of others?  It‚Äôs ok if you just want to trade to get a dope car and impress girls, have sex and become a cocain addict for your mission. But chances are, if you begin to make contact with any part of yourself that has an intention to fulfill your real purpose, it might involve helping others in some way and maybe even doing something good for the world.  What's important is that before you do this you get clear about *why* you are doing it. People who give up in failure probably don‚Äôt know what their reason is for doing this in the first place. 

So to get started, take this step and be serious about it.  Write down why you want to learn to get profit consistently in trading and what you plan to do when that becomes a tangibly manifested reality of your life. No need to share anything on what you intend but being clear with yourself can help you to follow through with that intention.

1626246137,2,1," A few hours ago, I posted a complex post about what I believed to be widespread fraud within the crypto industry on the r/Bitcoin subreddit, and ended up getting banned for asking about it.

I mentioned how it appeared that lots of exchanges were essentially ""printing"" fake ETH and BTC by adding them to people's accounts in exchange for real cash transactions, without anyone having a physical wallet to store said ETH / BTC unless withdrawal was requested.

This leaves the possibility open that many of the exchanges may not even have physical (on-chain) BTC to back all that stored crypto on their exchanges, and instead would only acquire said BTC as needed when people make withdrawal requests.

I then went on to explain how all that ""promissory crypto"" could be one reason why there has been such a devaluation of crypto in general across the board (including on DeFi), and how it could devalue the cryptocurrency on other non-centralized exchanges due to the perceived value provided by CeFi exchanges.

Here is hoping I can get your opinions without being banned for raising a point.

**Ethereum 's next fork in London is expected in early August. Here's everything you need to know to understand what this update brings to the network and why some in the community are skeptical.**

London hard fork will be released on August 4th. Similar to previous updates, there is already buzz in the community. This is the next step for the network as it prepares for the monumental move from a proof of work (PoW) system to a proof of participation (PoS) system with Ethereum 2.0. The complete change of the network will become public some time in 2022.

However, not all updates went according to plan. The network experienced some snags and glitches during the launch of the test networks, which caused an increase in skepticism about the news.

Despite the delays, this complete system refresh will bring the ability to compute a greater amount of transactions per second and the possibility to reduce network rates.

On the way to update London

As with previous updates, hard fork London includes a number of Ethereum improvement proposals, also known as EIPs. This latest update consists of five EIPs centered on fees of various types (network costs and refunds), transaction speed, and transaction amounts via scalability.

Between London and the previous update, Berlin, the network launched testnets for developers to continue their transition to the proof of participation. While all of these hard forks are temporary until ETH2 goes public, they are crucial to preparing miners, developers, and other community members for the permanent changes to come.

The most important overlay between the Berlin hard fork and the following test networks is EIP 1559. This proposed improvement specifically targets transaction fees. High rates are one of the hot issues with the transition to PoS, especially with increased network activity due to NFTs.

EIPs aim to make Ethereum more efficient

As stated earlier, these temporary hard forks are all in preparation for what will come with the ETH2. However, these are stimulating moments for the community to get involved with a new preliminary way of functioning for the network. Here are the EIPs that come with the London update:

EIP-1559: change in the rate market for the ETH 1.0 chain

This is certainly the most talked-about EIP and had the developers focused on fixing all the bugs. This starts a ‚Äúbase rate‚Äù, which affects all blocks in the network.

This base rate tracks rate prices across the network, making it easy to forecast the rate for wallets and users. It also allows for a defined maximum transaction and miner fee. Finally, EIP will cause transaction fees to be slashed to improve overall network economics.

EIP-3198: BASE FEE operation code

EIP 3198 follows the previous EIP as it adds an ‚Äúopcode‚Äù to return the base rate value for the block in which the transaction is performed. This improvement benefits those who create smart contracts in the chain.

EIP-3529: reduction in refunds

Refunds on the Ethereum network were initially defined as incentives for developers to tidy up if and when possible. However, the opposite has come true. This EIP removes fee refunds from SELF DESTRUCT and reduces them to SSTORE. Overall, this proposal will help offset the block size variation caused by EIP 1559.

EIP-3541: reject new contracts starting with byte 0xEF

Simply put, this EIP allows for the implementation of new smart contracts, which start with byte 0xEF. Those that already exist are not affected by this update.

EIP-3554: Difficulty Bomb Delay Until December 1, 2021

Lastly, the infamous difficulty bomb delay. This EIP delays the ‚Äúice age‚Äù, more formally known as the hardship bomb. This gives miners more time before mining freezes during the final transition from PoW to PoS. Although this has been postponed in the past, the transition is not ready yet, and therefore it is suspended longer.

Questions about Ethereum

There is always talk as a major network update in the world of cryptocurrencies approaches. Community members and crypto influencers are known to bring about imminent change, eitherCardano, Ethereum, or Ripple.

As ETH 2.0 is slowly coming to fruition this year, some hesitant comments are starting to surface in the community. On the one hand, it must be recognized that the increase in traffic due to NFTs has increased the need for efficiency in transaction times and in the pricing of network fees.

However, at the height of the frenzy, the network registered the lowest rates since the end of 2020. This drop-in fee prices appeared not long after the Berlin update. What London will bring is highly anticipated.

On the other hand, another network setback was not so welcome. ETH went through a price drop that approached US$1,559 before the London update. While the number 1,559 is something members of the ETH community are eager to see, the price tag put HOLDers off for a moment.

mixed expectations

As the London update approaches, miners and developers have different expectations for the updates. The main concerns are for miners due to changes in their current work pace.

As the network evolves, the rewards of mining are one of the biggest unknowns. For those who have been at it for a long time, concerns loom over an unpredictable slowdown and centralization of the mining process. Meanwhile, developers are eagerly preparing for what promises to be a monumental shift.

On July 22, the proposed Ethereum 2.0 chain merger was formally approved via GitHub, meaning that the first step towards the ETH 2.0 merger is officially underway. Along with implementing the hard fork, the user base must know exactly what to do now.

For those who simply hold the ETH in an exchange, web wallet, or hardware wallet, nothing changes unless otherwise directed there. Miners must update the ETH client and manually change the Gas target limit.

The London Update brings us all one step closer to a world of blockchains that work by proof of participation. As these new developments come to fruition, all eyes will be on the Ethereum network to see if it can maintain its place in the ever-changing decentralized sector.

1628924244,4,1,"Hi all, just recently got into Ethereum but feel like i've YOLO'd hard since (moved 1/6th of retirement and savings to ETH). Anyway, I realized why POW will always eventually hit a limit on how far it can grow, and that there is a real world physical limit to the value of a POW network.

From my basic understanding of POW, the network is secure because an attack is too costly. So in other words the ongoing cost of securing the network needs to be more than the profit of a successful 51% attack. That works out currently, and will continue to be possible in the short to maybe even medium term. But eventually we have to remember the cost of securing the network happens in our very real physical reality, not in the digital reality. Mining equipment is produced in the real world, electricity is produced in the real world. If the value of the Bitcoin network grows 10x, the cost of mining should go up 10x to stay secure. Bitcoin mining is currently close to the same electricity consumed annually as Poland.  10x Poland's energy usage means Bitcoin mining is consuming more power than every nation on the planet except for India, China, and the USA.  Well, what if the price of Bitcoin goes up another 10x? At 100x Poland's levels we are talking about Bitcoin mining taking up 1/3rd of the planets entire electricity generation. Bitcoin goes up another 10x? Now we're at more than 3 times Earth's current electric production levels.  


And part of the reason why the cost of securing a POW system has to be so high is because the value of being able to do a 51% attack is higher when you can do more than one attack but multiple attacks again and again. Let me explain:  if you spent the money on POW hardware and can buy tons of power, then you can get away with some money for doing an attack in Janurary, then again in Feburary, March.... you can keep getting away with attacking the system every time it forks  and tries to become legitimate again and gets back up and running smoothly again. Cause like... unless all the good and honest miners quickly buy tons of new equipment really quickly, then the 51% attacker always has the upper hand.  


But contrast that to POS attack. Let's say someone has 51% of staked ETH. The network can fork as a response to that attack, and then try to become a legitimate network again, and slashes the attackers staked ETH as a penalty. Well because the ETH is slashed, you need to buy more and more ETH and stake it each and ever time you want to own 51% of staked ETH and attack the network again and steal even  more from it. You're kinda limited to stealing from the network once and then it costs more to attack than it's worth.  


So there are substantially more physical constraints on how you can scale POW network security foever. It's so much more a physical constraint than compared to POS scalability concerns.

PS- sorry if that was kinda rambley-ish, but it's great when you have this \*eureka\* feeling of understanding there is a strong case of a Flippening being guaranteed. Cause at some point in the future, whether that's 5 years or 50 years from now: something has to happen.  Either 1) Ether surpasses Bitcoin, or 2) Bitcoin community agrees to switch to POS. And I think the chance of the Bitcoin community changing their mind on POW and moving to POS before a Flippening as a low chance. I personally feel the only ways the Bitcoin community would feel pressure to switch from POW to POS would  either be due to climate concerns from growing POW or how Ether's value grows so rapidly in comparison Bitcoin community notices POS is a growing in value much faster and so therefore a superior model as a store of value. 

PSS  I absolutely super do not hate on the Bitcoin community or any other POW community at all! They're all great people! Love what they post. Love what they are doing for crypto space. You have good reasons to like POW right now, but I just feel you'll come around to POS some point in the future.",ethtrader,I finally had my *eureka* moment on why POS will always outperform POW given enough time

Blockchains are a way of *trustlessly* exchanging value, but this isn't need in NFTs. The value of NFTs comes from *trust*, *trusting* that your token has authenticity. In a decentralized system, there is no way to ensure authenticity because anyone can mint any NFT, even if they have no rights to that intellectual property.

NFTs don't need blockchain and would do way better if they existed on a regulated, centralized exchange. Imagine a NYSE, but instead a NYNFTE that fully recognized your legal ownership of your NFT. You could trade anything from real estate to trading cards.

I think sometimes cryptopeople get so caught up in decentralization that they think that it solves everything, that they confine themselves to only innovate in that box. Decentralization is great for many things, but for NFTs I think it hurts it more than it helps.",ethtrader,Ethereum is holding NFTs back.

1631260622,1,1,"During our launch, a few issues were faced once the Start Block was verified on respective chains. The team and developers would like to take this opportunity to address these issues, as well as the measures that were taken to resolve these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Users were not able to Stake and Withdraw on the website‚Äôs frontend

&amp;#x200B;

When users were not able to stake and withdraw their tokens on our websites frontend, we immediately dived down into our codes to figure out the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The library that was used to handle big number values was converting large values into exponential form. (Example : 1000000000000000000 was converted to 1e18.)

&amp;#x200B;

The smart contracts don‚Äôt expect values in exponential form. Therefore an error was thrown while staking and withdrawing.

&amp;#x200B;

Do note that you can deposit and withdraw using block explorers of respective chains, BSC and Polygon.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution ‚Äî We changed the library for handling big numbers to Bignumber.js

&amp;#x200B;

2. Incorrect Value was displayed on TVL, Total staked liquidity and a User‚Äôs Stake

&amp;#x200B;

On polygon, USDC was used to calculate TVL, Total staked liquidity, as well as a user‚Äôs staked value. USDC on polygon is a 6 decimal token, while the common decimal values for a token is 18 decimals. As such, due this miscalculation, the valuations across TVL, Total staked liquidity and User‚Äôs Stake was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution ‚Äî Used different decimals for each token to get it fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

We acknowledge our mistakes and apologise for any inconvenience caused.

1631861305,2,1,"Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has made it a personal mission to find solutions for the saturation of the network. Now, it is the high demand for non-fungible tokens (NFT) that causes it and causes the fees to skyrocket.

As a proposal, Buterin has proposed a solution that consists of migrating the NFTs to second layers of Ethereum, such as *rollups*. It would not do it to a single *rollup*, but through an interoperability system that allows the NFTs to be used in several of these.

The proposal was recently published by Vitalik Buterin within the Ethereum Research Forum, dedicated to researching improvements in this general-purpose blockchain.

The Russian-Canadian developer suggests creating "" *wrapped-NFTs* "" or *wrapped-NFTs*. These could be mobilized and traded between the different Ethereum *rollups*.

The *rollups*, second layer solutions are basically ""roll-up"" multiple transactions into one, and thus allow you to process a greater number of transactions per second (TPS) outside the main network ethereum. For example, the Z sync 2.0 *rollups*, which are currently in the testing phase, **promise to process up to 20,000 TPS**, while the mainnet only processes 12-20 TPS in its current state.

Based on the above, the main point of Buterin's proposal is the non-dependence of a single *rollup*. While these offer reduced commissions, using just one can be counterproductive as, in the event of a failure, the NFTs would be trapped.

Using multiple *rollups* avoids this dependency model. Also, in case of failure, through the proposed system, the trapped NFTs could be migrated to another rollup or to the main chain.

## Swap NFT ¬´coiled¬ª

As said, the Ethereum creator's proposal is based on the creation of wrapped-NFT (WNFT). These, in a practical sense, would betoken that represent other tokens within the *rollup*. The original WNFT would be stored directly on the **Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract that would serve as a security vault**.

The interesting thing about this concept is in the mobility of the WNFTs when they are transferred. For example John ""rolls"" an NFT and sends it to the Arbitrum *rollup*. In this, Ivan decides to buy it. Ivan would be buying the WNFT and not the original NFT. However, according to Vitalik's proposal, when the transfer exists, an exchange voucher would be generated.

When Ivan wanting to claim it within the main chain, he should only present the voucher so that the vault can change the address that owns this NFT from Juan to Iv√°n.

n the event that a chain of exchanges occurs within a *rollup* , the last holder of the WNFT who decides to claim it will possess this chain of exchange vouchers and that will give validity to the holding on the NFT to be claimed. This also applies to NFTs that are transferred between *rollups* , which would also generate receipts.

## Vitalik Buterin's proposal presents challenges to implement

One of the main challenges within this model posed by Vitalik Buterin is that not all the *rollups* that currently operate on the Ethereum network will be able to be used. It is necessary that the *rollup* make use of the EVM or Ethereum virtual machine, which is basically the one that allows the execution of smart contracts.

In a report made by CriptoNoticias, it was learned that *rollups such* as Arbitrum and Optimism allow the full use of the EVM. On the contrary, zkSync 1.0 does not allow its complete execution, which limits the smart contracts that can be deployed in them.

Another obstacle is in the **adoption and implementation of this model on all NFT platforms**. For now, NFT's platforms are mostly based on the Ethereum mainnet. The use of *rollups* can mean an operational cost for the adoption and migration of your NFTs. Platforms may not be willing to bear that cost.

1631863690,3,1," General Conclusion

As people gradually realise the shortcomings of Ethereum such as stability, scalability, interoperability, etc., many other layer-1 blockchains areemerging as solutions for the future. Avalanche is one of them.

Avalanche ($AVAX) is a smart contract platform having the same concept ""Internet of Blockchain"" as Polkadot and Cosmos. Avalanche is an open source platform that enables the deployment of highly decentralised applications, financial products, digital assets, and interoperable blockchains.

Highlight

Avalanche's outstanding technologies:

* Speed: Avalanche's transaction processing speed is in seconds.
* Scalability: Avalanche is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second and can accommodate thousands of validators without sacrificing performance.
* Security: Avalanche ensures confidentiality and security. Avalanche supports smart contracts created and used by Solidity along with all the tools on Ethereum such as: Remix, Metamask, Trufle, etc.
* Users can create their own public or private blockchains.
* Built to serve the financial markets. Avalanche makes it easy to create and trade digital assets on complex terms. Assets can represent capital, shares, debt, real estate and many others.

What Problem Does the Avalanche Project Solve?

Currently, the financial market is still fragmented due to regulations and geographical distance. This makes trading difficult and a large amount of asset value is inaccessible for global users.

How

Avalanche allows financial networks to connect to a common platform that makes launching and trading digital assets easy. This is possible because Avalanche has created a platform for platforms where thousands of different sub-networks (depending on the users' purpose) can connect to create a global market network.

Token Use Case

$AVAX is Avalanche's native token and is used for the following purposes:

* Fees: Any activity deployed on a Avalanche subnet will be charged in $AVAX.
* Staking: To become a validator or block creator in Avalanche or one of all other subnets requires a minimum of 2,000 $AVAX.

Note: Total tokens are 720 million $AVAX, mainnet provides 360 million tokens. The system will continuously mine until the total supply limit is reached. The $AVAX used to pay the fee will be burned, increasing the scarcity of the token over time.

**TLDR**:

We have discussed about infrastructural development, and we reviewed a few important Legos. In the Avalanche ecosystem, after they develop a solid foundation, DeFI is the next point to look at. The projects in DeFi are still very primitive and few, but the potential is huge if Avalanche makes good use of it.

Currently there are about 30 projects developed on Avalanche, but only 4 have TVL &gt;$100, of which BENQI has surpassed $1B in TVL.",ethtrader,What is Avalanche Protocol ? :O

1632297170,3,1,"With the price charts of most altcoins flashing red candles on Monday, the global crypto market capitalization fell below the $ 2 trillion thresholds. In fact, it had dropped more than 5% in just 24 hours at the time of writing.

From Bitcoin and Litecoin to Cardano and Solana, almost the entire market was trading in the red, even on Tuesday.

However, the scars appeared to be quite deep for the altcoin leader Ethereum. After losing 5% of its value during the aforementioned period and 9% for the past week, ETH was trading at $ 3,078 at press time. In fact, during the early hours of Tuesday, the value of the coin had managed to drop as low as $ 2,807.

#### How concrete is the downtrend?

Before we get into the nuances, let's first dive into some 'financial astrology'. Well, don't let that phrase confuse you. To clarify before continuing, financial astrology is nothing more than mathematical psychology based on the science of astronomy. To be clearer, it measures the overall market sentiment.

The moon would literally guide us through the aforementioned process. Hold on to your hats - Lunar cycles, as such, can help predict price movements.

Assets generally tend to perform better during a particular moon phase and are more susceptible to drops during the other. And wait, before you laugh, you should know that the moon phases are a tried and tested method that can be trusted quite a bit, as are other metrics.

Moon Phases TradingView Indicator shows the phases of the moon on the chart. A dark circle generally indicates a full moon, while a bright circle represents a new moon. The bars between the full moon and the new moon are colored accordingly, either waxing or waning.

An interesting pattern can be seen in the attached table. The two weeks following any bright white circles represented on the chart have been bearish in most cases. Similarly, every time the Ethereum price has entered the yellow patches on the chart, the price has mostly witnessed a rally.

The fall in May practically occurred just after the bright white circle appeared on the chart, while the recovery during the first days of August took place on the days that followed the light white circle.

[Ethereum development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) released a fairly long red candle on September 20. It should be noted that the aforementioned day was a full moon day. That said, it should be noted that the price has now entered the ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù phase. In fact, at the time of writing, the budding candle was green and ETH was trading very close to its daily highs.

Before getting too excited about the aforementioned projections, it is essential to also look at the behavior of various market participants.

#### Collective merchant sentiment

Well, the state of the derivatives market seemed to be improving, at the time of writing. The number of long contracts settled in the last few hours has been almost negligible, while short settlements have been more prominent. This has reinforced the bullish narrative.

Other than that, the funding rates were positive on most exchanges, with the OI getting back on track as well.

Ethereum will try to settle in the next trading sessions. If this time the lunar cycle tradition is also followed, the alt price will make rapid advances northward in the coming days.

Therefore, it would be interesting to see whether or not the Ethereum price goes 'to the moon' in the next fifteen days.",ethtrader,Is it time for Ethereum to look to the moon go to the moon?

It‚Äôs been 5 years and still I don‚Äôt have much savings to even help. A 9-5 job just ain‚Äôt enough especially with prices going up and salaries still staying the same and having very little increases. 

Although I won‚Äôt be telling my family and friends about me investing in crypto. In fact, I've only informed a few close friends that I work with cryptocurrency. When someone inquired if he should invest, I told him there was a lot of promise, but made them aware that just like stocks, you might lose everything on a whim. It's as easy as that; they'll be aware of the danger and won't hold me responsible for any losses.

I was debating a price goal to make a small profit, but couldn't make up my mind. Now that I know, I'll simply hold on a little longer. Although I am not stupid to go YOLO all the way and use up all my money for it. 

For those curious, I am staking it on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), and [Haru Invest](https://haruinvest.com/). Planning for [Rocketpool](https://rocketpool.net/) soon but if you guys could give me some insights on other platforms, that would be great.

I'm not investing this money in ETH, BTC, or any other cryptocurrency merely to buy a new vehicle or whatever. This is for my retirement and to assist my family. I do this to supplement my income and invest in cryptocurrency. If a bear market occurs in 2022, I'm fine with it. I'm not interested in 2022; I'm interested in the next decade and beyond.

Just got it through online via some online writing competion shits. From there onwards HODL into doge only to sell it @0.1 mark and did some serious trading without learning a shit.. got myself into **Negative** 

Now there are mainstream memecoins like Doge and Shib pretty holding tough. These two are holding only because more and more people are willing to buy cause their price is pretty damn low and the **lure** of becoming millionaire has garnered extreme adoption from small investors. While other important coins/tokens like BTC, ETH, SOL, DOT, AVAX, and so many projects have the following things that adds value:
1. Dedicated dev teams.
2. Foundations (with funds at disposable to invest into the project)
3. Good tokenomics 
4. Good Fundamentals 
4. Reliable and proven Founders (except BTC as we all know it)
5. Good social media and community engagement
6. Use case and problem solving attributes
7. DEX or DeFI stuffs mostly 

**_Finally_** memecoins do not have any or most of the above mentioned characteristics and totally a meme that mocks crypto and poke fun and sometimes jokes and amusement are important. So this is my view on memecoins like doge and _SHIB_",ethtrader,My thoughts on memecoins!!!

1644567208,1,1,"[Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/), a custodial crypto-investment platform, hit 175 million dollars AUM. In November 2021 it got 600 $BTC, now 4000 $BTC, showing 660% growth in three months. For obvious reasons, this growth is stressful for all the parts of its ecosystem.

In terms of asset management, the platform found diversifying hard for Bitcoin and Ethereum to be able to produce 17% and 23% APY (the highest rates on the market) for an increased amount of capital inflow. The current market conditions do not favor $BTC yields in DeFi. The average risk-free rate for BTC is 5% APR. The company forecasts that in a month or more the market can start moving in a huge upward movement, which will make it much harder to sustain any significant yields for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On its side, it is working on creating various strategies on $BTC upside movement (automated options, building long positions, searching additional exposure) and closing some of the positions that can suffer from that.

But the healthy way for Midas to evolve, according to its management, is to start reducing extreme rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This will lead to lesser risks due to the upcoming extreme volatility of Spring. The plan is to reduce it by 3-5% of APR, like -20%, which still remains the highest on the market. The ETA is February.

In order to compensate for this yield reduction, Midas plans to list new coins with high APR on staking and implement rewards in Midas token (575% increase over the last month) with boosted APR.",ethtrader,Ethereum Interest Rate Change on the Leading Passive Income Platform

1645607374,8,1,"Hi there. I'm very new to crypto. I'm trying to take in as much knowledge and advice but I just don't know where to begin.

What coins should I buy? When should I buy them? What apps/software/websites should I use?

When I research I find on YouTube that the market is crashing and so is crypto? Then when I look else where I find it hard to find the same news. Is it the time to buy now?  From what I'm being told the prices of the coins are dropping and its a good time to get in (let me know if this is completely false).

I know a lot of you have a large amount of knowledge and are very experienced in all of this, so that's why i thought this was the best place to ask.

Sorry for the noob questions XD

FYI - I'm currently a student and working in South Africa so I don't have the biggest income and I have a limited amount I can invest.

Thank you in advance to those who help me :)",ethtrader,When to start investing?

1647071737,1,1," I'm still very new to this world so I'm open to any thoughts, critics, or suggestions on my learning progress thus far, as I'm sure I still have some underlying misconceptions about crypto and defi. I live in the US and am in favor of both decentralization and centralization when appropriate. I don't have a lot of money and defiantly don't have enough invested to worry about capital gain/loss taxes but nevertheless I am very conservative with my stable coins. I want to see them (at least USDC, DAI, and UST) given more attention by the fed before I stake my savings into it but at the same time I view them as way to minimize exposure to inflation. Because of this rationale I don't really trust platforms like anchor or beefy that are offering ridiculous apy on their coins, and another main reason why I've left stable coins out of this list entirely is because from my personal audits gemini is the only platform I trust to handle lending my stable coins for me 100%. I know there have to be some platforms that are truly making insane yields and are paying out investors fairly but it's so time consuming to audit how these cexs, dexs, and doas are making money that I've just had to make it a rule to stay away from anything that seems to good to be true. Even if the platform has lots of liquidity, money deposited, or staked I still don't trust it until I can see where the money is actually coming and going from. If you all have some insider info on how these super high apy deposit sites are holding their reserves, making these yields, and how they are distributed then feel free to share the supporting documents so we can openly audit them! Also I'm pretty bent on maintaining full custody of my assets, hence the reason why I marked any LPs as no, they are not fully owned by the investor (myself), and why I include argent (zk ftw). I understand that wrapping and staking coins removes some level of security and ownership so you're probably thinking ""why don't I trust pools?"" Well on one hand I'm somewhat confident in my understanding of the tech but on the other hand I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to understanding the market... I would like to earn some yield that is better than what you can earn depositing/lending/staking so it seems liquidity pools might be for me, but I can't keep up with the constant due diligence that seems to be required and permanent loss scares the shit out of me. Also I mine btc so don't have to worry about fiat onboarding for btc, but for other tokens (eth, avax, matic, etc.) I'm planning on investing usd so any suggestions for some fait on-ramps would also be great as well! Lastly there is the actual process of transferring any coin into a yield bearing coin. Like I said I'm new here so these are just the onboarding process I've found so far, and to me most of them seem a little overbearing (too many steps + fees along the way) hence why I made this chart in the first place. So, if there are anyways to optimize the processes I've found or alternatives to them I would love to hear it! Really though any incite on the subject would be great to hear as I'm finding a lack of current/reliable information out there, and as fun as learning this on my own has been I think it's time to start having some conversations with the community!

1647683397,0,1," The cryptocurrency field  spreads and develops actively through every area of life. As any other segment there are players who dive into the market, take their benefits and then come into oblivion.. This is not my own view, it is just a business as it is. Real ones, who care about the future of their brainchild, never give up. They're gonna do everything to save up their produce. To be honest, users and consumers can't distinguish real intentions from fake ones if it is talking about profit for themselves.  They are marketers' preys. So that you have to listen to your brain, not heart and find out the background of investigators. 

Now I want to share my own view on the perspective project concerning digital decentralized banking. As i already said above, only consumers can develop the best product in their segment. Due to that i want you to get acquainted with KYRREX. According to what I've seen, it's a well-established firm with industry expertise that relies on a devoted staff with banking and blockchain interests, so it would be a perfect place to start for the two sides to collaborate. 

In greater detail, Kyrrex has used blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to establish the world's first global digital bank, revolutionizing traditional banking and linking it with cryptocurrency financing. The conversion of digital assets and fiat currency will be considerably easier with Kyrrex, since it can all be done through a single application.

Without a doubt, it is a platform that works right away and is quite easy to use. It now includes quite thorough portions, and it appears that everyone who joins will be able to manage it effectively. It is perfect for users, and I hope that it will soon be ideal for businesses and institutions, as it is on their roadmap. If this is the case, it would be a significant advantage for the token, and we may expect significant gains from it.",ethtrader,Who can create the best functionality for traders' activity if not themselves?

I usually stick to the trading strategy, but in the last month I am roughly unlucky, I get only stop-losses. This has made me lose confidence in myself and my strategy, and I really don't know what to do. 

Earlier this week the market was in risk-reduction mode and suddenly took off sharply. Could this be a bullish market rebound, I am thinking about opening a short position on bitcoin but I lack confidence and certainty as I see bullish signals but I am scared to get a stop loss back as if the market is doing it to spite me.

Investment in graphics is a contentious subject in the field of intellectual property. Virtual world artists that were previously unknown are now well-known in their respective fields. Paintings, photographs, collages, gif animations, and music are all available for purchase, and pricing records are being established.

There is one event in the NFT market that, in my view, is important to the merger of the online and on-chain worlds: the issuance of the NFT token. NFTs in the gaming industry are on the increase. Players have clearly shown a desire for games in which they may create their own characters, weapons, and other objects. Despite the developers' hesitation, the number of gamers who have improved artifacts is growing. They are more interested in putting their products through their paces on a new platform and seeing how they compare to those of a competing player and their artifacts. Tokenized artifacts, in my opinion, represent the greatest chance for the future of the NFT.

Please keep in mind that there are at least 18 or more NFTs. Despite the fact that they have a substantial fan base, they are not well-known outside of their immediate vicinity. The idea of NFTxCards and the deployment of its features, in my opinion, have been the most successful. They will become well-known in the future for their one-of-a-kind range of high-performance NFTs.

1651562886,0,1,"I think that it never happened before that buyers paid more than $100 million as fees in the first few hours of the mint on.  


So you might have read that users had to pay thousands of dollars in Ethereum fees to get an NFT that might be worth a few bucks. That happened that day, I saw that someone pay a $3500 transaction fee for a $500 NFT.  


I was shocked when I heard that the mint raked in more than $317 million for the company. It sold 55,000 NFTs at a flat price of 305 ApeCoins ($5,800 at the time of mint).  


I use Metis for quicker transactions and reduced gas prices and it's awesome, but this...This was a kinda different problem.  


Are some of you one of these people who had the misfortune to be at the wrong place at the wrong time?  


The overall process put a significant strain on the Ethereum network, which processed these transactions, driving increasing transaction prices for all projects on this blockchain. Some people were forced to pay hundreds of dollars for transactions worth only a few pennies apiece.  


Many people believed that Yuga Labs might have created a more effective smart contract to save costs after witnessing high gas prices. However, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin stated that even if Yuga Labs had improved the smart contracts, users would have paid more for NFTs.  


It's interesting in this whole story that the company also mentioned that it might look to migrate ApeCoins to its blockchain. What do you think about this, is this a good idea and do you think that will happen?",ethtrader,Do you think that BAYC will have their own blockchain after this debacle with Ethereum's enormous gas fees?

Then there are the high apy's for stablecoins. do you really think that banks could ever turn a  profit by providing its costomers 20% apy s when the profit they make is 4-6% this is juat not sustainable sure there are mechanisms put it place and actuall cash to make sure it doesn't implodes but it will eventually happen as they cannot just pump cash infinitely

So, this implies that customers who paid a lot of money for one of the digital assets are trapped with it in just one game that no longer receives fresh material from the publisher, similar to what occurs with more traditional virtual gaming gear when a game goes down. This may hurt individuals who paid a premium sum for an NFT.  


I recall having a plan to check out F1, but thank heavens another NFT game, K4 Rally, blew my mind and completely distracted me just as I found out that F1 was closing down.  


And who guarantees that we will get compensation if something similar happens? Do you know how they regulated this and whether this issue was regulated at all?

Ether whales made a total of 2,956 transactions, each valued at over $1 million on Wednesday, marking the highest day of whale transactions in nearly five months (whales are typically defined as any account holding between $1 million to $10 million).   


Did any of you do some recent transactions?  


We had so many worries lately, high gas fees, and now all the crypto scene feels insecure, people started using now even more L-2 solutions, I personally rely for months on Metis, and these L2 platforms provide me to feel more secure when it comes to lower gas prices and faster transactions.   


I sometimes think it's impossible to work without them, what do you think?  


What I've found out in one article about these massive transactions is that Carlos Gomez, chief investment officer at Belobaba crypto hedge fund, said that this type of market activity may mean crypto investors are closer to the bottom of the current market dip than they realize.

It has a TON of liquidity and all the major dApps and smart contracts are built on it.

Whales are still buying ETH which is bullish asf cause these are the market makers. Open Etherscan and you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about. Giants like BitDAO alone already have more than 200,000 ETH in their treasury and are buying on average 380 ETH daily.

So, I hope that this could be helpful for some of you.  


So, here‚Äôs a list of the essentials you need to know before investing in Ethereum:  


\- Buy Ether only from reputable exchanges (eToro, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Binance, etc.).  
\- Find a suitable L2 solution to lower gas fees (Metis, Loopring, etc.).  
\- Use 2 Factor Security and use strong passwords.  
\- Don‚Äôt leave your crypto assets on exchange platforms.  
\- Buy and use one of the best hardware wallets available.  
\- Invest only the amount you are comfortable losing.  
\- Be able to make the right decisions and cash out when it‚Äôs the right time.  
\- Timing - don‚Äôt buy at an all-time high, don‚Äôt sell at an all-time low. You should consider buying more when the market is still recovering from its low spot.  
\- Diversification is necessary for any investor to reduce risk, and invest in more than one cryptocurrency.  


Keep in mind that as the years' progress, Ethereum‚Äôs technology will grow.

Ethereum is transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus with the merger of the Ethereum Mainnet and Beacon Chain. We know that it will reduce power usage by 99%. But what about other stuff?  


I remember that pretty often people were annoyed by expensive gas fees, they were enormous sometimes, many people even paid more for gas fees than it's the price of the NFT they're minting which makes no sense.   


I was using a couple of L2 solutions for this issue, Arbitum, then Polygon, and now Metis. I believe that thanks to these solutions people continued working with ETH.  


But I'm curious how much the price will rise after the merge, how the merge will affect the price, and whether it will be low or high. Does anyone have any ideas?  


As far as I know, the transition to PoS will help focus on increasing scalability in the Surge phrase through sharding and rollups to significantly reduce gas fees. Right?",ethtrader,The Merge will not impact gas fees

1661414552,1,1," The major issue and main criticism with Ethereum has always been gas fees and traffic.

We all love Ethereum. Its is the home of our favorite projects, but the fact remains that it is one of the least efficient blockchain to build anything on.

However, with talks about the merge happening in September and the development of sharding following right after, this will all most probably change by a 180 degree.

Sharding will make Ethereum indistinguishable from the one we have today. Gas fees will become irrelevant and proover durations will be cut down dramatically.

I must say though, that Ethereum itself won‚Äôt scale and that only L2s will be upgraded by the implementation of sharding.

But this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at all. Ethereum‚Äôs devs know exactly what they‚Äôre doing.

L2s on Ethereum have the right infrastructure to support sharding and to some extent are even more equipped and ready than the Ethereum blockchain itself.

Many L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism already have very fast and efficient tech.

Better yet, some L2s like Zksync are focused on zero-knowledge proofs which will supposedly be the future of Ethereum based on Vitalik

Zksync also already has a zkEVM testnet that is operational and they‚Äôre also launching a DAO specific scaling solution with the funding and help if BitDAO.

So taking all of this into consideration, I‚Äôm not really that worried about L2s taking the responsibility of scaling the Ethereum blockchain.

Can you imagine an Ethereum where you don‚Äôt have to worry about gas price or validation time? It sounds very weird and to some extent surreal to me but we‚Äôll get there eventually. And it should take that much time. Apparently towards the mid/end of 2023, sharding would have been implemented completely on the beacon chain!",ethtrader,Sharding will make Ethereum unrecognizable by the end of 2023

1662026240,1,1,"This is one of the very many questions I have found people ask as they presumably prepare for the coming transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-stake network. The interesting part to all of this is the fact that the publicity around the coming Merge has been so huge it has even led to tremendous FUD among the not-so-knowledgeable investors.

The plain truth which needs to be pushed in the coming days as we approach the slated date for the Merge is that Ethereum‚Äôs transition has no ‚Äúeffect‚Äù on ETH token holders like you and me. The same rule applies to other Ethereum-built cryptocurrencies which you possibly could be holding such as the Toklok token.

So what should I do to my ETH tokens? The simple and straightforward answer is absolutely nothing. How about to some who have asked if their exchanges would support the ‚Äúnew ETH?‚Äù the answer to this is this: the merge isn‚Äôt some form of upgrade to ETH. It is not like an upgrade from ETH v1 to ETH v2. So you really do not have to bother about whether your exchange would support or not.

I know there are a handful of other questions surrounding the merge. I would simply advise that you should be careful now and after the merge as there would be lots of scammers ready to swindle the ignorant.",ethtrader,What should I do to my ETH token before The Merge happens?

This sinister scheme has even started right now though in a subtle form since these scammers have already seen how little a lot of crypto investors know about the merge and its implications. So while there‚Äôs going to massive publicity for Ethereum-built tokens like the toklok token, there‚Äôs also going to all kinds of scam types flying around.

If there is one thing you should however know, that would be that the merge really has no effect on you as an end user. I guess that‚Äôs the plainest way I can say this. And do you know the implication of this? You do not have to do NOTHING to the ETH tokens you hold or to other ERC-20 tokens you hold.

The need for better technology has always been on the rise with preferential and essential features centered on flexibility, scalability, independence, security, and the option to work seamlessly and with ease. What more is needed?
 
Several projects are putting all of this together to improve existing tech features; ctsi, ETH 2.0, qansplatform, Geeq, and many others I'm unaware of. But Geeq actually piqued my curiosity due to its multifaceted approach and the fact that it does not have a single niche like many blockchains. What interests me is that the enterprise blockchain can function side by side with the DeFi application while having nothing to do with each other. Additionally, the secure validation layer is untouchable - there‚Äôs no smart contract validation because all it does is validate.
 
Based on its fundamental features, I believe Geeq is among the few projects relevant for reinforcing the DeFi spirit. My joy is that, despite recent global tensions and a black swan event in all sectors and endeavors, the space is not slowing down. Better days lie ahead in DeFi, and we are yet to witness the best.",ethtrader,The Rise of Blockchain tech

I used to avoid crypto play to earn games and socialize to earn platforms because I'd been scammed by most of them. Of course, I adhere to the fundamental rule: DYOR. However, it's a bit complicated because the market is flooded with projects, let alone alt-coins. 

I have recently become more interested in social to earn because I see a lot of potential as more web 2.0 social platforms transition to web 3.0 through rewarding members for their engagement., Having read through several Reddit threads, I have also seen some great crypto devs come up with models that work. Similarly, I am seeing a rise in the number of  people who are bullish on these types of projects.  


As part of my research, I have compiled a list for myself: GARI, Taki, Carbon, Minds, read Cash, [StepN](https://stepn.com/). These projects (IMO) have strong support. To give you an example: [Taki raised](https://twitter.com/superlayerio/status/1527043901692837888) $3.45 million from 11 of the world's most prominent web3 investors, including Solana Ventures, CoinDCX, OKX Blockdream Ventures, Alameda Research, Formless Capital, Gemini Frontier Fund, and Coinbase Ventures.

1572684156,0,1,"Decred has caught a burst of long overdue wind today. 

Below is my thesis on recent price action drivers and why I think Decred is insanely undervalued right now from an on-chain/blockchain mechanics perspective.

This is an expansion on a tweet I put out here  [https://twitter.com/\_Checkmatey\_/status/1190349477120552961](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1190349477120552961) 

Fundamentally, the project is one of the most undervalued assets in the market and I believe the largest information asymmetry next to Bitcoin. The smart money know this. They have been accumulating. Looking at the volume of DCR moving on-chain, we can see a significant amount of DCR moving in 2019 at the current support range. We know that DCR is always on the move due to tickets so when we see high volume nodes like this, it supports the notion of actual accumulation in addition to the usual transaction flow. We have seen similar growth in the median and mean transaction sizes throughout 2019. Larger wallets, larger DCR purchases.

[DCR moving on-chain Volume Profile](https://preview.redd.it/bhn7v4dz68w31.png?width=593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d93c80a07e796f02c4591ba264055be46bdb60a)

The recent price action drawdown in my opinion is a result of Miners going too hard to fast. ASICs were introduced in early 2018 and we see an explosion in PoW Difficulty. Mining is a leveraged play for DCR and in this case is unlike what occurred for BTC in that it was almost four years until ASICs were on the scene for Bitcoin. This means that Bitcoins naturally high early inflation had time to disperse before ASICs and serious hardware investment came online. ASICs are capital intensive, not hobbyist grade meaning coins mined must necessarily become coins sold. 

We can compare the insane growth in Decred mining since Jan 2018 against the market to see this on a relative scale. **Mind you, this is a bullish signal**. Miners are committing heavy capital to the Decred chain security. They have done their due diligence and have high conviction. That is not something to ignore. 

Full tweet on this here  [https://twitter.com/\_Checkmatey\_/status/1177650799050133504](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1177650799050133504)

[Normalised difficulty growth \(left\) since Jan 2018 and \(right\) 2019 Year to Date](https://preview.redd.it/zxmd0cxg88w31.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e70c1cdd202217e88ee6a0499762bfbfe666a50)

As miners over-extend without support of price appreciation, they must sell more coins to pay bills. Eventually the weak miners have to capitulate and difficulty ribbon squeezes as mining equipment is switched off. We have seen this play out for Bitcoin where squeezing of the difficulty ribbon indicates a valuable period for accumulation. Willy Woo talks about this here  [https://woobull.com/introducing-the-difficulty-ribbon-the-best-times-to-buy-bitcoin/](https://woobull.com/introducing-the-difficulty-ribbon-the-best-times-to-buy-bitcoin/).

What happens next is that the strong miners gain an increasing share of the hashrate. Their energy is thus rewarded with more DCR and so they can sell less of their income and Hodl more. This effectively begins to constrain supply rather than the oversaturation during capitulation. Over time this leads to a reversal in price action which further perpetuates the effect. 

Price of a scarce asset must appreciate with reduced circulating supply assuming demand relatively remains stable or increases.

[Decred total cumulative block subsidy paid \(price x block reward DCR\) and Difficulty ribbon](https://preview.redd.it/sesrcjxw88w31.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=900e2202c27649a3fea8a646c7bee922d6f6e7a5)

**This is actually very healthy for** **Decred**. Coins are being distributed by miners en-mass right now, nullifying the risk of miners holding too high of a supply within the staking system leading to centralisation. I would argue that this distribution of coins is one of the most important and bullish signals long term. We know that miners stake as well and thus they are able to generate income on Hodled coins. I expect this to actually soften the degree of miner capitulation as they can turn off power whilst still generating income. 

For this reason, I do not suspect we will see photos of mountains of Decred ASICs being thrown out as we saw for Bitcoin in 2018. The machines are simply put on hold until price reverses to justify power consumption. This is a valuable business feasibility case for miners and a feature of long term sustainability in the chain security.

**Decred Resilience**

This is where the elegance of Decred resilience steps in.

As miners slow, supply saturates, price drops. 

DCR Tickets become cheaper. 

Stakeholders step in and accumulation begins. 

The Ticket Price hit an ATH of 140+ DCR as Stakeholders begin accumulating and commit capital to secure the chain. The Hybrid PoW/PoS system works as a counter balance. When price is in a strong uptrend, stakeholders are provided an exit to capitalise on gains as miners have a strong case for expanding their operations (PoW dominant security). During price drawdowns, miners drop out and the cheap DCR stimulates Hodlers buying and locking capital which locks down available supply from an attackers. An attack would thus drive price higher and the cycle repeats.

[As above, showing the total DCR locked in tickets hits an ATH as price drops due to miner capitulation](https://preview.redd.it/n5w2tr8r98w31.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b62173655a6ce057ba8d994dcc17573d990c3f61)

PermabullNino made the observation that Decred functions as an elegant yet robust accounting system. His discussion on block subsidies are shown in the charts above and linked here [https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b).  
Decred has a has past, present and future cash flows distributed to those who support it most. This puts Decred security in good hands  
\- Miners 60%  
\- Stakeholders 30%  
\- Builders 10%

Price is currently hovering around the PoW total subsidy paid (red line) and means miners are indeed feeling the squeeze as this is the cost basis of all DCR paid to date. Once you factor in overheads and capital costs, it makes sense we are seeing DCR supply distribution. The last time we saw price dip to this line was early in Decreds history and was followed by a rapid repricing.

We now have three mechanisms at play which will act to constrain supply

* Miners are distributing heavily but eventually will switch to hodling as the strong miners hash share grows.
* Stakeholder are absorbing supply en mass and locking in tickets due to relatively cheap prices
* Inflation rate is in a state of constant reduction

**Scarcity**

My recent work looking at the Decred stock-to-flow model (which does exist and is convincing, contrary to what the Bitcoin maxi community may want to believe), suggests that DCR is in the oversold range. It has deviated by 1.5 standard deviations from the S2F model mean which is near identical to Bitcoin at 50% supply mined. Historically for Bitcoin and Decred, this has been an opportune period for accumulation. More on this discussion in my tweet here  [https://twitter.com/\_Checkmatey\_/status/1184159137564889089](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1184159137564889089) 

Note that Decred, likely due to the smooth issuance and difference in market awareness, is less volatile than Bitcoin. The significant undervaluation of Bitcoin at 50% mined was due to the first 2012 halving where it was a very different and far smaller market. I would expect DCR to be repriced sooner rather than later as the smart money steps in having now developed Bitcoin hindsight.

[Standard deviations of DCR and BTC price from the respective stock-to-flow linear regression models](https://preview.redd.it/q45vslevb8w31.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=139c8ed94c710f43dab0212141fda7fc57040399)

As a final note, if we look at Decred and Bitcoin market valuations plotted against ratio of 21M coins issued, which normalises for coin age, we see a fascinating similarity in these coins trajectory. Bitcoin was worth $127M at 50% coins mined and Decred was worth $180M. Considering we are in a log scale market, this is practically the same. Decred has achieved this value both benefiting from market awareness and size, but also in the face of heavy (albeit generally ill-equipped) alt-coin competition, quite remarkable.

*Processing img jddze305i8w31...*

Given that Decred has such insanely strong fundamentals, has developed a convincing monetary premium in it's short life and traverses the same stock-to-flow path as Bitcoin, I believe there is immense value flying under the markets radar.

The recent price action drawdown can reasonably be attributed to miners over-extending. However based on both prior Decred behaviour and drawing comparisons to Bitcoin history, there is a strong argument to be made that supply will soon be constrained on multiple fronts and the current value is both highly undervalued and being absorbed by the smart money.

Feedback, counter-points and discussions welcome.

The crowdfund smart contract has been written in such a way, that it should ensure delivery of the product - or at least protect you from no delivery by getting your entire contribution back. (see below)

The intended audience is mainly power-users, and by that I mean, people who know how to program (in Python), know their way in linux, bash and on the commandline... Or Raspberry pi makers. That being said, it should work for beginners as well, but expect at some point that you will probably have to get technical (It's intended to be run on a Raspberry pi 3 b, so sooner or later, you will at least need to update the device.). 

If you don't want to get your feet wet, don't buy it.

A lot of wallets and portfolio apps have been made, which is great, but I wanted something simple, and portable, - and not on a phone - where I had 100% control, so I wrote it in Python 3 (as I have been doing a lot of development in Python over the last few years). There's a lot of multicoinwallets out there now who somehow claim to be open source, but whose source is nowhere to be found. They USE opensource libraries, but the end product is closed. This will be COMPLETELY open sourced if crowdfund targets are met. It's not a wallet btw, it only tracks price.

The idea is very simple. You keep your entire portfolio as a csv file, and every time you adjust your portfolio, you add a line to the csv with the current date. This way you can easily build a version history of your portfolio.

I'm looking for people who like to play around with the code, optimize it for their own needs (and preferably contribute the enhancements back to the community.)

So expect the basics in UI-friendliness. (the web app is built with Flask and Vue). Check the website for a link to a Youtube screencast that demonstrates the app.

If you want to plugin data science tools, if you want to experiment with automating your portfolio at scale, and track your performance with a lot of data, this is the portfolio software for you.

(For example I included some scripts that auto update Livepeer balances from staking wallets.)

Apart from the portfolio software (which is not tied to the device btw, it works on any OS with Python installed), this is also a simple display, that shows you the rate of your top 10 coins. (the gadget...)

It probably looks like a ridiculous gadget, and to be honest, I don't mind at all, hence the website name [rocketclock.club](https://rocketclock.club), referring to the rocket meme. 

But in all fairness, I've been working on and off on this project for the last 2 years, but the first prototype has been on my desk for almost 2 years, and it has one very cool feature, that in my view, is priceless. 

It kept me calm. Holy crap, has this thing kept me calm throughout the bear market. No endless refreshing on Coinmarketcap, or my phone. Just this tiny device on my desk, with the e-ink refresh every 5 minutes. It's what has enabled me to focus on my work, on developing, and not be distracted by the market all the time. You would maybe think the opposite should've been true, but this has been my experience.

The e-ink display is also written in Python, so it could be easily adjusted if you want to include custom data. (Maybe you would like to replace the rocket with another emoticon or meme, that would be pretty easy).  
Market data is pulled from Coingecko, so please beware that its functionality depends for a large amount on this website. All that being said, I haven't experienced much downtime since I started using Coingecko.

If the download is not delivered on time, you can withdraw your entire ETH contribution (price + collateral) as you can read in the smart contract.

(Please read the contract to understand how this works. The original smart contract was reprogrammed because somebody on the Bitcoin talk forum asked how I would guarantee the delivery of the download. The token you receive acts as a vote of approval.

1577271491,0,1,"The emotions in the crypto community are in the range from mild boredom on the positive side to apathy and depression on the other extreme. Despite the gloomy background, I believe 2020 will be one of the best years in the history of crypto assets bringing record highs. 

Here are the reasons why‚Ä¶

**The broader economy**

We live in extraordinary times. Central banks are determined to avoid a recession at all costs by providing liquidity and cutting rates which creates a speculative investment environment. The low interest rate are pumping the valuations of almost any asset class and are also making money managers climb up the risk ladder in search of a meaningful return. Since government bonds don‚Äôt yield anything, investors need to buy corporate debt, the ones who previously bought corporate bonds are now into stocks, the stocks loving investors have moved capital to private equity and venture capital etc.

The FED balance sheet jumped $370 billion since September in a new program which is ‚Äúnot QE‚Äù. They also cut the rates 3 times this year fighting against a falling stock market and a ‚Äúpotential global slowdown‚Äù due to the trade wars and Brexit. As a result we have fresh all time highs in all major US stock indices. 

Germany is hovering around a recession, avoiding it technically with a dismal 0.1% growth in the 3rd quarter of 2019. At the same time the DAX index was only 1.3% short of making a new all time high this month. 

Even Greece that was on the verge of dropping out of the eurozone four years ago, managed to issue government debt at a negative rate this year.

The cost for avoiding a recession creates a distortion in the valuation of all assets. How do you value anything when interest rates are negative? For great insights on the topic read Howard Marks‚Äô memo on the [‚Äúmysterious‚Äù negative interest rates.](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/mysterious.pdf)

This search for return will drive more people towards riskier asset classes like growth stocks, venture capital and eventually the luring asymmetric bet of crypto assets. ""Risk on"" state of mind is what crypto needs as the whole asset class (even bitcoin) is perceived as very risky.

**US election year**

Trump will do anything to keep the stock market and the economy going in 2020. The argument is short but compelling. 

He has been very [vocal](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190269494788263936?s=20) about the new highs and didn‚Äôt miss the chance to praise himself for the huge 2019 stock returns. He will likely not do anything that will blow the positive investor sentiment. 

This is another tail wind for risk prone investor behaviour in 2020 which will favour crypto assets.

**The halving narrative**

Bitcoin‚Äôs block reward halving is scheduled to occur in mid May 2020. It will bring the daily production from 1800 down to 900 coins per day. This will also cut its annual inflation in half to less than 1.8%. While being twice less powerful than the previous having in 2016, this production cut is still going to influence the price. As a self fulfilling prophecy or a supply-demand result, both previous halvings were followed by an upward price spiral that resulted in a bubble and a blow off top. This is relationship is difficult to ignore and if there is a favourable ""risk on‚Äù environment in 2020 there is a good chance it will happen again. It may also come faster as investors will try to front run it. 

Also, this time we have halving events in the two major forks of bitcoin which did not exist back in 2016 - BCH and BSV. Despite being controversial, they are still among the top 10 largest crypto asset. Their supply cut and potential price rise may help feed the whole ‚Äúbitcoin halving‚Äù narrative and create an upward price spiral for the whole sector.

The latest example of a halving was in litecoin this year and it had a very distinct price effect. 

**It‚Äôs been a while since the last bubble**

It‚Äôs been exactly 2 years after the top of the previous bubble. Most alts are over 90% down from their all time highs. That is a lot of damage  for the speculative investor who came in 2017 and 2018. 

Also the lows in most coins were set one year ago and have not been broken down despite prevalent pessimism. This has been a painful environment for anybody looking for a quick buck. 

There is also a widespread apathy and pessimism among the crypto community with even hardcore believers changing their forecasts to [mediocre](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1209457337393647617?s=20) 2020. 

After 2 years and lots of assets down more than 90% from ATH it seems that most of the coins are held by very strong hands. Therefore downward pressure is limited and if it occurs it would be mainly driven by short term speculators.

**Tech development**

The hot word of 2016 was ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù. The whole world got excited about it in 2017. 2019 is the year of DeFi. 

In case bitcoin gets close to $20 000 again the ‚Äúlate"" money will flood once again to smaller crypto assets seeking higher returns. If/when bitcoin‚Äôs blocks get full and transactions become expensive the old narrative of ‚Äúbitcoin doesn‚Äôt scale‚Äù would become valid again and this would spread money to BCH, BSV, ETH and others.

Another potential narrative that exists today is the ‚Äúdecentralised finance‚Äù  - exchanges, derivatives, stablecoins, borrowing, lending all that infrastructure got far more sophisticated since the last bubble. Apart from DeFi projects tokens, Ethereum is also poised to be one of the top beneficiaries of this trend as it hosts most of the DeFI activities. However the ""Ethereum doesn‚Äôt scale"" narrative is also valid so a lot of money could spill over to the competition in the smart contract space.

It‚Äôs been more than 2 years since the scaling problems became obvious and a lot of projects that specialised in that domain are up and running. Others are at the final stages of being launched. What would be a better test than a real world influx of new users and apps that will try to fill the capacity. The process of finding a proper scaling pathway will be pushed forward in case of another bubble. 

**Conclusion**

That scenario will change in case of a global recession that brings the ‚Äúrisk off‚Äù attitude. Then assets will fall into a negative price spiral and investors will be looking to preserve their capital by fleeing to ‚Äúsafer‚Äù assets. Although such a recession is inevitable at some point, it seems that central banks have been very good at avoiding it by kicking the can down the road. If they succeed again in 2020, get ready for an explosive crypto year. However, do not assume this run will be the same as 2017. It depends much on the global economy and investors‚Äô risk appetite and it may be cut off earlier and not result in a full blown bubble like the one from 2017. The sensible investor needs to be cautious and plan for the short run in this environment.",CryptoCurrency,2020 Will Bring Record Highs for Crypto Assets Despite Pessimism

1577784595,0,1,"**NYZO** is the highly efficient Proof-of-Diversity (PoD) blockchain for everyday spending.

NYZO has been developed from the ground up, it is an open-source initiative and isn't a copy of any existing blockchain project.

The network has been running for more then one year now and the source code can be found on GitHub. The NYZO codebase is going to start acting as an API server. This will be run-mode dependent, just like the various web server functions that are available now. It will interact with the mesh on one side and whatever it needs to interact with on the other side.

Developers update NYZO all the time with fixes and performance and stability improvements. Every update which has been created for the network so far has been accompanied by a release note, a detailed document detailing every change to the network to make it better.

We can find these release notes on the website of the developers: [**What's new?**](https://nyzo.co/new) \- as you can see, the network has been worked on on a regular basis and each release note is multiple pages long - developers are dedicated to making this a success and this is their testament.

**Whitepaper**

**Proof-of-Diversity** **(PoD)** consensus mechanism requires active participation in the form of time and verifier behaviour in the blockchain to be allowed to exert a certain influence on the system as a whole. The **Proof-of-Diversity** blockchain uses verification cycles to establish the authoritative form of the blockchain. The basic concept of proof-of-diversity is simple. Verifiers take turns producing blocks in a circular order. Some simple rules ensure that verifiers are neither added to nor removed from that circular order too quickly.  In order to produce a believable forgery of the blockchain for any meaningful amount of time, an attacker would need to obtain more than half of the private keys of verifiers currently working on the blockchain. The design and technology are simple and clearly explained in [**NYZO whitepaper**](https://nyzo.co/code). This document was created in the very beginning and it might not cover all aspects as it should, the release notes make up for this.

Still too lazy and didn't read NYZO whitepaper? Relax, and listen to the soothing [**audio version**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=PTck-bjTorY).

**Verifier**

Mesh (cycle) participants are called verifiers. Verifiers are in charge of verifying transactions and producing blocks. In exchange for securing the network, verifiers collect transaction fees which are distributed fairly among all of them. Each verifier gets a chance to verify one block in one mesh cycle. NYZO don't need mining equipment and large amounts of processing power like others, only unique IP address and always on Linux VPS is required.

**Sentinel**

The purpose of the NYZO Sentinel is to provide improve stability of the cycle by producing blocks for in-cycle verifiers that are unable to produce blocks due to temporary hardware and network issues. The Sentinel should not be run on an instance that is running the verifier. The NYZO sentinel is a seperate version of the nyzoVerifier designed to protect your in-cycle verifiers. Its job is to constantly check up on your verifiers. If one of them is unresponsive, the sentinel will initiate communication on behalf of the verifier, this all to ensure future cycle inclusion.

**The Mesh (cycle)**

is simply a network of computers known as verifiers all running NYZO and communicating information to each other. [**The Mesh (cycle)**](https://nyzo.co/) is a central point of **PoD** system. For securing the Mesh these computers are given 10% reward of transaction fees for each block they secure.

[**Check your NYZO verifier status, search for your nickname or IP**](http://94.130.179.46/nyzo.html)

Newcomers can sometimes get confused with how [**Nyzo verifier lifecycle works in practice or how to join the cycle**](https://twitter.com/My_Altcoins/status/1153723195519901698).

**Block files**

One part of the consensus algorithm is the block consolidation process which ensures that a small machine such as a Rock64 Pro or a beefy Raspberry Pi can run a NYZO verifier with little storage space. [**1000 blocks**](https://nyzo.co/blockFiles) are consolidated into 500 Kb of storage space. Very efficient.

**51% attack resistance and energy efficiency**

NYZO has a properly designed economic model that relies on time. Therefore, the cost for 51% attacks (relative to market cap) is huge, there is ongoing incentive to participate in the network, and attacks based on computing power (PoW) or ownership of token (PoS) aren't feasible. NYZO uses only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin‚Äôs resources while performing the same tasks. 58 000 000 000 kwH - 58 TWh : current BTC power cons. per year vs 36500 kwH - 0.0000365 TWh : current NYZO power cons. per year = 1,589,041 times more efficient and 51% attack resistant.

**Roadmap**

NYZO developers have been asked many times for a roadmap. The roadmap is to keep making the code more stable, more robust, and more efficient.

**Scalability**

NYZO doesn‚Äôt require any Layer 2 scaling solutions and is able to handle high transaction volumes per second which is only dependent on the performance of the verifiers in the mesh. The block time is 7 seconds and block size is 28 Kb.

[**Micropay**](http://micropay.nyzo.co/) is a lightweight way of using NYZO that shifts as much burden as possible to the person receiving the payment to make it as easy as possible for someone to send small payments. Next step is an API server for Micropay.

*The initial developer fund plan can be found* [***here***](https://nyzo.co/buildingNyzo)*, this has been followed up and*[ ***the details have changed***](https://nyzo.co/buildingNyzo2)*. The developers effectively own 0.6% of the total supply. So far around 8 million has been ‚Äúmined‚Äù and the remainder is spendable by the network through governed voting, with a minimum amount of votes required for NYZO to be released (75% of the network needs to agree).*

(all examples with images and links can be found in the [latest article](https://medium.com/crypto-punks/upgrade-your-subreddit-with-these-best-reddit-practices-afe80f0fde3e))

1. Onboarding resources. Every day thousands of people visit this sub for the first time, so some onboarding material would be helpful. It can be placed in the top menu or in the sidebar. An onboarding material can be a post, a Reddit wiki page, or a link to some external web page. Feel free to suggest a good external resource.

2. AMAs are a great way to increase engagement and bring more people to a sub. Mods can approach crypto influencers of their choice or add a button to a sidebar like ‚Äúrequest an AMA‚Äù using Google forms. AMAs are also a good way to inform a public about unfolding events. For example, an AMA with Dropbit team, whose CEO Larry Harmon faces up to 30 years in jail for working with mixing services, would be informative. Feel free to suggest your own candidates.

3. Surveys. Conducting anonymous surveys can increase engagement and attract some attention from news outlets. A survey can be conducted with Google Forms or other third party solutions like Survey Monkey and be presented in a Reddit post. Feel free to suggest questions, dates, and other tools for a survey.

4. Cultural exchange events can be organized with other subs that share similar interests or face similar challenges. For example, r/HongKong (437K members) can be a good fit, because both HK pro-democracy movement and cryptocurrencies rely on the decentralized governance with a very complex infrastructure. Two other subs I‚Äôd recommend are r/privacytoolsIO (73K members) and r/privacy (673K members) because they also advocate for a high privacy. Feel free to suggest other subs for cultural exchange and please explain why they would be a good fit.

5. Event calendar. All upcoming events (AMAs, surveys, cultural exchanges, etc.) can be listed in the sidebar.

If you have any other suggestions, then that‚Äôs a good opportunity to let us know.

If you‚Äôre interested in decentralized movements, you can also find some practical suggestions and tips in an open-source manual [decentralized activism](https://github.com/SamAI-Software/decentralized-activism).

P.S. This is my first Subreddit Improvement Proposal (SIP), but later I‚Äôll create similar posts with different suggestions in other crypto-related or activism-related subs.",CryptoCurrency,"Subreddit Improvement Proposal (SIP) for r/cryptocurrency: onboarding resources, request AMAs, surveys, cultural exchanges, events calendar."

You're using a service that takes your (probably legal) coins, and trades them for coins with a dirty history. You're gaining some privacy by helping someone else launder their money- or you're laundering your own money directly.

Either way, you're incredibly likely to end up with some tainted coins.

Privacy coins are not illegal, and won't make you complicit when it comes to helping others launder their money. Stop using mixing services, and support privacy coins instead.",CryptoCurrency,Privacy coins are legal. Mixing/laundering services are not.

Let's imagine a perfect scenario- everyone knows for Bitcoin, volume is high, people are spending it and/ or stacking sats. Now, this is **not** a good thing for govs, reasons were mentioned thousands of times on the internet so I will not bother about mentioning all of that again. How to kill Bitcoin, you may ask? Declare it illegal, start the propaganda machine, prosecute people who are mining or using it, shut down mining farms under the accusation of supporting the system that is used by criminals- add a bit of human trafficking, drug dealing and money laundering to the headlines to make it look justifiable in the eyes of average Joe. After all of that, hashing power will probably go to 20% of what is now. Next step, seize the ASICS and conduct a 51% attack. Congrats, no more BTC. You may say that your rights are hurt, but CCP (Communist Party of China) doesn't give a fuck.

There is a cryptocurrency that could survive a ""mass extinction"" of that kind. It's called [Idena](https://idena.io/) and it's **truly** unstoppable. It's using a novel protocol called ""Proof of Person"". In order to mine it, you must prove (validate) that you are actually a human being, all **without** 3rd party or personally identifiable documents (aka KYC). How to prove that you're actually a human being? Currently, validation days happen a few times a month, and validations start at the same time all over the globe- New York is at 9:30AM, Berlin is at 3:30PM and Sydney is at 11:30PM. Validations involve solving a user-made flips- flips are user made captchas that are impossible to solve by machines- because they involve abstract thinking and emotions, which only humans have. Incentive to make flips is simple- to validate on next validation day you must make 3 flips which will be randomly distributed to other users on the next validation day. Idena introduces sybil resistance by limiting the time of validations, you can validate yourself on one node, it's almost impossible for one person to have two nodes. All mining rewards are split equally to every miner, so there is no concentration of hashing power, mining farms are impossible and stopping/ censoring is **impossible** because Idena can work on any 64bit OS- Windows, Linux, MacOS and even Raspberry Pi- Computing power is irrelevant and it will be irrelevant forever! To stop Idena, governments must ban computers, from all people who are running this most decentralized and democratic currency on the globe!

loads of changes. significant change is that it market orders 1/10 of the amount if pos &gt;350 &lt;-350, every interval, and adjusts the 1/10 mark to achieve a consistent 75% maker volume.

This lessens the overall risk and allows for a higher pos\_lim\_long &amp; short.

The more we can keep delta neutral, the less we have to worry about significant moves.

How's the bot been running for you? Are you my ref also running eth?

We might also want to kill march futures (by default on btc on repo, just remove 'btc-' from 'btc-mar20' and it'll also kill eth mar fut) because we're close to expiry.

SLs now reduce to delta neutral, instead of marketing out the entire position. This is extremely helpful in not losing a whole bunch of $ on SL, meaning we can SL more often.

Hey Deribit,

I did about $200k volume on BTC perp and futures last 24hrs on $70 balance.

and &gt;$6million total.

my CEO has done $12m

We‚Äôre increasing our market maker first to $5k balance next week on a separate account, next pilot will be $150-$300k and then our first round of funding will be \~$50m (which should be a significant amount Deribit but also diversified a bit).

We‚Äôre wondering if we could negotiate a preferred fee rebate on top of the standard offer, to provide this kind of liquidity? Even a slight improvement on rebate would be exponential for us.

And this is just me talking out loud:

&amp;#x200B;

The bot checks funding rates on Deribit among perpetual and futures, and longs whichever pays the other. When longing or shorting perp and shorting or longing futures, it 4x the longs on perp in ordersize so that ‚Äî effectually ‚Äî at any point it should be near 0 total position. This effects a situation where upwards or downwards movement in market doesn‚Äôt affect the returns, and you effectively collect on fees + the convergence of your perp and futures in cash n carry arbitrage + the spread.

But if there is anything that the drop in crypto prices the past week shows it is that crypto has instead become just another asset in the mainstem financial system. That's not to say that there hasnt been innovation and disruption resulting from crypto (mainly DLT/blockchain stuff). And this isn't the worst drop ever or anything but it's the first that I recall being linked with massive stock market drops.

1584864304,0,1,"Unibright UBT ‚Äì An investors dream
 
Introduction:
 
It is safe to say the majority of people believe growth should be intrinsically connected to competence ‚Äì there is no exception with the crypto ecosystem. At its root the key quality of the crypto ecosystem is its ‚Äònewness‚Äô in turn this means there are competent projects that remain under the radar with LIFE CHANGING PERCENTAGE GAINS to be revealed.
 
I want to talk about one of these projects that deserves your attention, I present - UNIBRIGHT (UBT). Unibright hits all the hallmarks that suggest LIFE CHANGING PERCENTAGE GAINS are highly probable.
 
Lets agree on three key factors a project with vast growth potential must have:
 
1.       Real utility (does it serve a required purpose)
2.       Bargain Price (relative to its utility and the entire ecosystem is the asset price low)
3.       Supply (The limitedness of the asset)
 
Unibright - UBT holds all these qualities.
 
Key Summary:
 
Amongst other attributes, the purpose of Unibright is to port enterprise to blockchain.
 
Right now we are seeing the bubble pop on finance 1.0, and once the markets complete their devolution questions will be asked such as. ‚ÄúWhat can be learned, what can be done better and what are the alternatives ?‚Äù A big answer to these questions will be ‚ÄòBLOCKCHAIN‚Äô. What do I mean by this?
 
We live in ‚Äòthe age of information‚Äô, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the absolute corrloation of value represented in the age of information. Therefore as an edge against traditional finance 1.0, enterprise MUST diversify and become correlated with these emerging digital representations of value and money. Let me connect the dots, clearly ‚Äì right now UNIBRIGHT is purpose to port ENTERPRISE to any blockchain. This fact is also compounded by Unibright been a key element in the Baseline protocol which in essence is a branch of Ethereum that is geared up for porting enterprise to the Ethereum blockchain.
 
Unibright is also linked to Microsoft, EY, German banks, SAP and tenuously with Facebook Libra.
 
Also worth a mention is the exchange listing strategy. The team have been very considered in terms of the types of exchanges that list UBT, so far the exchange listing are the main Ethereum exchanges. This in my opinion is a well thought out strategy, it enables the incubation and organic growth of a sound investor base. What‚Äôs more is the BIG EXCHANGE LISTINGS STILL AWAIT, another words there future investors are still in the pipe-line. The token is available via exchanges such as, IDEX, Kyber Network, Uniswap and Bancor.
 
Price, Predictions and Conclusion.  
 
The token is currently available for around $0.15. There are only 150 million tokens! so relative to Unibrights use case, the majority of crypto ecosystem the token is vastly undervalued.
 
I predict in right market conditions and successful enterprise porting to blockchain UBT will hit a price range between $10 to $40 ‚Äì this is an approximate 25‚Äô000% increase. We have seen many cryptos do this before.
 
Unibright by my assessment is the epitome of a life changing opportunity. In conclusion, if you believe competence, utility and unrealised price with is a precursor to LIFE CHANGING PERCENTAGE INCREASES then I urge to further research and consider Unibright - UBT.
 
I have failed to talk about Unibrights Freequity, the 360 framework, tokenomics and many other well defined strategies that underpin Unibrights key to success. I invite you to find out more; the Unibright telegram chat is a brilliant start as well as their website.
 
I am in no way affiliated with Unbright or any of their associates. Amongst only three other crypto currencies I hold a moderate volume UBT.
 
About me:
Professionally, I have worked in the field of data analystics for just under a decade. My interpretation of large data has resulted in my employers‚Äô organisation to evolve and succeed to ever changing demand. I am also a competitive crypto investor who was wise, lucky and unbiased enough to successfully navigate through this brilliant and emerging crypto ecosystem.",CryptoCurrency,Unibright UBT - One to consider

1584876964,1,1,"It is possible to distribute advertising content by placing a bot in OLMarket. An advertiser can train 
their own bot or choose one out of our patterns prepared with different parameters. When 
exporting a bot in OLMarket, the smart-contract is created in which an advertiser sets the budget 
for the advertisement campaign. The OLTarget service analyses targeted parameters and creates
a negative price for the neurobot, taking as a basis the advertisers‚Äô requests, matching them to 
users and the budget of the PR campaign. When placed in OLMarket advertising, the bot can be 
additionally promoted to the catalog‚Äôs top positions.
When finding this neurobot, a user can import it into their account and get a reward of the 
denoted negative value of the bot. An advertising bot may fulfill different functions. They can be 
OLAI neurobots that are created by other users or a commercial organization, a mobile 
application or game that is integrated into OLPORTAL. The possibilities of OLMarket allow users 
and off-site developers to implement their products (frameworks, applications, games, neurobots, 
different business decisions) on the basis of OLPORTAL with open API, extending or supporting the 
general functional.
OLTarget is a full-scale bilateral service for the promotion of advertising material in OLPORTAL 
with the application of AI. This is media content placed by an advertiser, which will be displayed 
only to those users, who fit chosen parameters and who have given their permission for viewing
a certain category of advertising. The settings of OLTarget will have a wide range of options, 
going beyond sex, age, region, photo data, activity in social media or messengers, social 
preferences, communication parameters and other criteria.
With the help of this service, an advertiser can place materials by choosing necessary target 
parameters independently, affect payment for these services in the OLPORTAL application using 
OLCF currency via OLWallet. When creating an account in OLPORTAL, a user enters their 
personal data allocated on decentralized network OLNet, which provides the decentralization of 
the account, full confidentiality and data security from any institutions, companies and individuals, 
including OLPORTAL. The OLTarget system identifies targeting parameters chosen by an advertiser 
and picks up a targeted user, who views the advertising, according to these parameters with the 
help of the implemented AI.
A user will get rewards calculated from the advertiser‚Äôs payment automatically after he or she has 
viewed the material and/or followed the link in the advertisement. The user will get their reward in 
OLCF tokens on their account in OLWallet. 
This strategy distinguishes OLTarget from large, famous targeting services such as Google, 
Facebook, Instagram, MyTarget, and so on, where users share their personal data with these 
corporations, where there is no question about true confidentiality, where users are ‚Äúsold‚Äù to 
advertisers without asking for their permission and sharing profit with them.
Thus, when using the OLPORTAL application, users will have the opportunity to meet their 
demands and get rewards independently from someone, without risking their privacy and 
confidentiality",CryptoCurrency,OLTarget with AI

I'm working on a project that is built for DeFi users. Basically, this is a platform where users can put multiple strategies across different DeFi protocols into **one transaction**. If you‚Äôve heard about DeFiZap, imagine this tool allows you to create your own Zap and also put different Zaps together into one tx. So for example, say you have some ethers, and you wanna invest them in Uniswap ETH/DAI pool and supply USDC on Compound. To make this happen, you will: 

1. Swap a portion of ETH to DAI (now you have ETH + DAI)
2. Swap a portion of ETH to cUSDC (now you have ETH + DAI + cUSDC)
3. Add ETH and DAI to Uniswap pool
4. Supply USDC to Compound

With our solution, user can package step 1-4 into one transaction.

* Visit Uniswap -&gt; skipped
* Visit Compound -&gt; skipped
* Sign tx four times -&gt; skipped three and only sign once

Users can create any DeFi combo as they wish. This is just one example to demonstrate the idea. The core value of our project is to provide flexibility for users to combine different DeFi strategies and save their time &amp; gas. Currently, creating customized DeFi combo into one transaction is only possible if you know how to code. We want to break the barrier of coding skill so that users can focus on creating DeFi strategies.

Mobile apps for crypto trading
As the capacity of mobile devices with powerful processors increases, there is a need in mobile apps for crypto transactions.
Digital currency has drastically changed the world of finance, and it cannot be underestimated.

1585905489,5,1,"Paul Le Roux is a fascinating character, whose story entails drugs, gold, arms dealing, North Koreans, Iranians, elite-level encryption, Somali pirates, women...and more women.

Let's get into it...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 1/5 - The Early Years**

Paul Le Roux was born on Christmas Eve, 1972, in Bulawayo, the second-largest city in what was then called‚Äîby the white minority that governed it, at least‚Äî Rhodesia.

In 1980, Robert Mugabe became prime minister of what would now be called Zimbabwe, ending minority white rule in the country.

Four years later, when Le Roux was 12, the family relocated to South Africa.

Not long after the move, in exchange for washing his father‚Äôs car, Le Roux was given his first computer. After that, a relation of Le Roux states that he became ""completely anti-social.‚Äù

When Le Roux was 15 or 16, in the late 1980s, the local police raided the family home and arrested Paul for selling pornography. After that, Le Roux turned even more inward.

Although he was an excellent student, he despised the idea of learning Afrikaans, which was compulsory in South African schools, describing it as ""a dead language"" that he ""didn't want to learn.""

At 16, he dropped out of high school and decided to follow his interest in computers, taking a local programming course.

Family lore has it that after he spent one class explaining some technical fact to the teacher, he got a letter saying he no longer needed to attend. He then completed a year‚Äôs worth of material in eight weeks!

Accounts of Le Roux do indicate that he was exceptionally gifted, and people who worked with him described him as a genius.

After returning from a family holiday to Disneyland in the US, 17-year-old Le Roux decided to leave South Africa, and departed for the UK eight months later to work as a programmer.

He then moved from the UK to the US, where he lived in Virginia Beach.

After six months in the US, he followed his then-girlfriend Michelle to Australia in 1995. The couple married and Le Roux acquired Australian citizenship.

Le Roux frequented message boards and enjoyed trolling Australians. A typical post read:

""All of Australia could disappear into the Pacific and the only difference it would make to the World is the Americans would have one less pussy country to protect.""

His posts caused outrage on the board - someone even changed their handle to fuck @ you.paul

Le Roux would later declare that his correspondents had fallen for his ploy:

""Australians are east to provoke and your postings (including 2 death threats, numerous flames, and one guy who swears he has my address &amp; phone number) have provided me with hours of amusement.""

Of course, Le Roux did more than just troll Australian message boards in this period...

Le Roux had started building E4M - Encryption for the Masses - in 1997, releasing it at the end of 1998.

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 2/5 - The Turning Point**

E4M allowed users to encrypt entire hard drives, and to conceal the existence of encrypted files (such that prying eyes wouldn't even know they were there).

According to Le Roux, the software was written from scratch, with thousands of hours going into its development and testing.

As well as this, in the [Politics section of the E4M website](https://web.archive.org/web/20010408201122/http://e4m.net/pol.html), Le Roux published a sort of Manifesto, describing how ""governments are increasingly relying on electronic data gathering"" and how ""Strong Encryption is the mechanism with which to combat these intrusions, preserve your rights, and guarantee your freedoms into the information age and beyond.""

In the spirit of the open-source software movement in the late 90s, Le Roux released E4M for free and made the code available for other people to improve.

Therefore, with no income from his two years of labor, he was struggling financially. His marriage fell apart violently and the couple got divorced in 1999.

Le Roux first relocated to Hong Kong, then to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He married a Dutch citizen named Lilian, and they had a child shortly after.

In 2000, in order to monetize E4M, Le Roux launched [SW Professionals](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405063022/http://e4m.net/) in 2000.

Based in South Africa, the company offered offshore programming, including E4M customization.

One of Le Roux's clients was an Italian telecoms engineer called Wilfried Hafner, who had corresponded with Le Roux for several years about E4M.

Hafner had founded a company to create a commercial encryption product that would combine some of the elements of E4M with another piece of software, Scramdisk. The new company would be called SecurStar, and its product would be called DriveCrypt.

Hafner hired Le Roux to build DriveCrypt's underlying engine.

At the time, Le Roux was desperate for money - he drove a beat up car and worked out of a Rotterdam apartment small enough that, on the phone, Hafner could often hear a baby crying in the background.

Hafner on the other hand was living in the South of France, and Le Roux openly coveted the kind of success that he imagined led to such a home. He told Hafner: ""I am ambitious, I want to have all this.""

However, in the middle of the development work for DriveCrypt, Hafner discovered that Le Roux was still working on E4M and had incorporated some of his work for SecurStar into his personal project. As a result, Hafner terminated Le Roux's contract.

By October 2002, SW Professionals was now defunct and Le Roux was openly soliciting for work on the alt.security.scramdisk forum.

It was around this time that Le Roux received some news that ""shattered his whole world.""

In 2002, he travelled to Zimbabwe to retrieve a copy of his birth certificate.

On the trip, his aunt and uncle pulled him aside to tell him the truth, and it was then that Le Roux found out he was adopted.

Although many family members had known for years, Le Roux‚Äôs parents had elected to keep him in the dark about it.

It was the ""unknown"" part that hurt him the most.

Shortly after, Le Roux appeared on an another set of message boards - he seemed to be launching some kind of moneymaking scheme that required opening a company based in the U.S.

In 2004, a group of anonymous developers did exactly what Hafner had feared: they released a new and powerful, free file-encryption program, called TrueCrypt, built on the code for E4M.

TrueCrypt combined security and convenience, giving users the ability to strongly encrypt files or entire disk drives while continuing to work with those files as they would a regular file on their computer.

Hafner and his SecurStar colleagues suspected that Le Roux was part of the TrueCrypt collective but couldn't prove it.

As we'll explore in Part 5, TrueCrypt is an interesting part of this story...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 3/5 - Money and Power**

After Le Roux's departure from the encryption world, at least under his own name, he entered the Internet-pharmacy business.

What Le Roux did next was combine two of America's favourite past times, popping pills and online shopping, and the results were sensational. He turned over around $300MM in 4 years.

In 2007, Le Roux moved his family to Manila, where he would base his operations. He also had call centres in Israel. This was a brilliant move by Le Roux, as the authorities were not looking at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as hot-spots for a large-scale organised crime operation...

Le Roux was moving serious volume during this time - his operation was once one of FedEx's largest customers.

A relative of Le Roux pointed to 2008 or 2009 as the point at which Le Roux snapped.

""I think the money got to him. I personally saw $100 million in his office in Makati. Cash, bud. It was fucking ridiculous. It was in wicker baskets lined up on the side of the wall in his office.""

Le Roux's appetite only grew, and not just in the literal sense (he was known as the ""Fat Man"" in the Philippines): he wanted to be a different kind of businessman, a lord of the real underworld, not just the virtual one.

An Israeli associate of Le Roux tells how ""Le Roux wanted to make more money, fast. Le Roux wanted to diversify, to be bigger. The only way to do that was illegal. He was living inside a movie, you could almost say.""

As well as this, Le Roux was notorious for his sexual exploits - he once wrote to his cousin, ""15-20 a week, sometimes 3 per night.""

A former call centre employee tells how Le Roux approached him with an assignment, which at first he thought was collecting women for Le Roux to open a bar. However, that was not the reason, as Le Roux explained:

""I'm going to impregnate them, and build an army of kids.""

Le Roux asked him to make a spreadsheet to track the women: their names, dress size, age, medical checkups. The operation was given top priority by Le Roux, who even sent his emissary to China to try to find women there.

It is rumoured that Le Roux has *at least* 11 children to 7 different women!

Le Roux's businesses expanded into logging, precious metals mining, gold smuggling, land deals, cocaine shipping, and arms dealing. These activities were spread across dozens of shell companies registered all over the world.

Of course, he needed to launder the money. Le Roux used paid muscle in Hong Kong to swap cash for gold bars, and then proceeded to stash the gold in warehouses in Hong Kong (this totalled around $50MM).

Speaking of paid muscle, Le Roux had plenty: ex-soldiers and mercenaries made sure any problems were dealt with force if necessary.

Le Roux was closest to ex-British soldier Dave Smith, who would act as the leader of the mercenaries and allow Le Roux to insulate himself and not have to deal with people. In fact, Le Roux once told Smith ""I live vicariously through you.""

However, things took a turn for the worse, at least from Dave Smith's perspective, as Smith stole $5MM worth of Gold from Le Roux.

Le Roux was furious. He then summoned Smith to his place in the country, and asked him to dig a hole as they needed to stash some gold. However, when he arrived, he was greeted by a South African hit-man. After the hit-man had finished shooting Smith, Le Roux then grabbed the gun and fired into Smith's corpse.

Le Roux then set about building an arms base in Somalia.

To achieve this, Le Roux called upon an ex-soldier from Europe, code-named 'Jack' to work for him on the ground in Somalia.

At sea, Jack had to bribe Somali pirates.

It was actually *this* activity in Somalia that landed Le Roux on the radar of the DEA, as he popped up in a UN Report on security in Somalia.

The DEA were now on his tail. Of course, his encryption skills came in handy - Le Roux's thick layers of encryption meant that the DEA needed someone on the inside...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 4/5 - ""Well played gentlemen, well played""**

Le Roux was getting more and more paranoid about people in his organisation stealing from him. Without justification, he suspected that his self proclaimed 'Golden Boy' Jack was stealing from him - so he ordered a hit on Jack.

This was a huge mistake on Le Roux's part, as Jack then called a CIA hotline and went on the run. It was 18 months later that a DEA investigating Le Roux found Jack's message to the CIA. The DEA agent then called Jack. Scared for his life, Jack agreed to turn informant.

In the meantime, Le Roux then had a change of heart and apologised to Jack for ordering the hit on him. The DEA then asked Le Roux to go back to work for Le Roux - they now had someone on the inside.

To tempt Le Roux, the DEA devised a sting operation. They knew that Le Roux wanted novelty and excitement. So they fabricated the scenario that Jack had made contact with a high profile Colombian trafficker, and the Colombians wanted to bypass the Mexicans for their meth supply in the US.

Le Roux was hooked. However, the DEA needed to lure Le Roux out of Manila, as his network of corrupt officials would ensure he will never be arrested.

Jack needed to get Le Roux to Liberia (where the DEA had a trusted ally in Fombah Sirleaf, Head of Liberia's National Security Agency).

Jack achieved this by saying that they needed to meet a cartel representative to finalise the deal.

It worked, and Le Roux was arrested. Initially, Le Roux went into passive resistance - he was a big unit (hence the nickname ""Fat Man"") - and it took around 10 agents to get him on the plane to fly back to the US.

Well he settled on the plane, the first thing Le Roux said to the DEA agents was: ""Well played gentlemen, well played.""

He then said: ""If you're looking at me, then clearly you're looking at bigger things...""

The DEA agents were intrigued: ""No Paul, you're the prize - what could possibly be bigger than you?""

Le Roux responded: ""Nation states gentlemen, nation states.""

He then started to spew out extremely valuable information on North Korea and Iran.

Of course, this wasn't the only leverage Le Roux had...

The enforcers who were once on Le Roux's payroll needed to be held accountable for their numerous murders, and the DEA were desperate to get them behind bars. Le Roux was key in their eventual capture. But that's not all: a crucial piece to this story is Part 5...

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 5/5 - TrueCrypt**

As we discussed previously, Le Roux was rumoured to be a member of the TrueCrypt collective.

In November 2012, a man with the online handle Cincinnatus decided to throw a party in Hawaii. The idea arose out of an email exchange with Runa Sandvik, a developer and expert on the online software Tor, which allows its users to mask the physical location of their computers on the Internet.

After she gave a Tor tutorial on Reddit, Cincinnatus sent Sandvik an encrypted message. Cincinnatus told Sandvik that he lived in Hawaii. Sandvik mentioned that she would be there on vacation the following month and could give a talk on Tor.

Cincinnatus suggested they host a ‚Äúcryptoparty,‚Äù a phenomenon that had arisen around that time among technology- and privacy-conscious activists. The date was set for December 11.

Unbeknownst to Sandvik, her fellow party planner was hatching a much more elaborate education scheme. Four days after he contacted Sandvik, Cincinnatus sent an email to the journalist Glenn Greenwald. ‚ÄúThe security of people‚Äôs communications is very important to me,‚Äù he wrote. In a series of emails, he suggested that Greenwald set up an encrypted means by which sources could contact him.

Cincinnatus organized the cryptoparty at a hacker space called HiCapacity, located in the back of a furniture store in Honolulu.

When Sandvik arrived around 6 p.m., Cincinnatus introduced himself as Ed and told her that he worked at the computer-hardware company Dell.

Ed kicked off the evening by welcoming the attendees, then invited Sandvik to give her presentation on Tor. When she was finished, Ed pulled out his laptop, plugged it into the projector, and began his own instructional talk about TrueCrypt. In Ed‚Äôs presentation, Sandvik later wrote, he ‚Äúpointed out that while the only known name associated with TrueCrypt is someone in the Czech Republic, TrueCrypt is one of the best open-source solutions available.‚Äù

Six months later, in June 2013, Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras published the first of a series of articles that grew out of their contact with Cincinnatus.

In time they revealed that *his full name was Edward Snowden*, that he had worked in various capacities at the National Security Agency, and that he had downloaded and handed over a trove of documents from the NSA in an effort to blow the whistle on what he believed were egregious privacy encroachments by the U.S. government.

**Among them was a document revealing that TrueCrypt was one of a small number of encryption programs that had withstood the NSA‚Äôs efforts to crack it.**

**What Snowden and the rest of the world wouldn‚Äôt know for another two years was that Paul Le Roux, the man whose code formed the foundation of True Crypt, was at that very moment in the custody of the U.S. government. Le Roux was in a bind, facing the full force of a U.S. federal prosecution for any number of his extraordinary array of crimes. The only way out was to spill his secrets...**

I dont appreciate getting treated like a criminal for trying to help my DYING father out. The man just lost his wife the day after christmas due to cancer and less then a month ago he had another heart attack killing 25% more of his heart. Through this all he has for income is social security at 1,500 a month. I moved up here from LA to help him with his ranch and the animals along with the finances. when I moved here we both got sick with pneumonia and he just got out of the hospital from that. Plus with the corona virus bs my entire county is on lockdown inside there homes so I cant go to work here. So, I sold my car and tried to invest in to monero so I could take advantage of the current volatile currency market (hopefully) and help him pay the mortgage that has already passed on his beautiful house just had just finished building with everything he has worked for AND his wife had worked for. You guys called me and treated up both like criminals for using your service and take our money? Then have an attitude when we are confused why and not helping us one bit, still keeping the money without a further word!!! I am not USING anybodies information, IT IS MY DYING 73 YEAR OLD FATHER FOR GOD SAKES have a friggin heart you monsters. YOU are the criminals we have done nothing wrong except trusting you with our livelihood.  I am going to post this incident all over social media and contact my father lawyer if you dont just HELP ME!

I can back up any verify EVERYTHING I have said including why I want to invest into monero and how every single day you hold my money you are killing us. Look at a recent chart of monero and even a 3 year old could figure out why I want to invest in it.
Its gone up 45% in 14 days 5% every single day, Im not stupid or a criminal Im just poor and under some odd circumstantial hard times. Please dont make it worse for us then it all has been and is, People will have a field day with this story on social media and boycott your company I can guarantee that much.

The fund, Universa Investments, was founded in 2007 by Mark Spitznagel, who is also runs the fund as the Chief Investment Officer.

Nassim Taleb is Universa's Distinguished Scientific Advisor.

From 1999 to 2004, Spitznagel and Taleb ran Empirica, a hedge fund which applied very similar tail hedging strategies to Universa.

Universa made huge gains in 2008 - as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 38.5% by the end of 2008, the fund increased its investors's money tenfold.

Of course, even when a recession hits, Universa's investors won't starve - they have enough money to invest more than $50 million, which is Universa's minimum investment, and this will be a relatively small part of their overall portfolio.

Universa essentially offers a ""black swan protection protocol"", telling clients to think of the fund as catastrophe insurance that allows them to pursue returns more aggressively, without the need for more traditional approaches to risk mitigation.

Mark Spitznagel, who runs the fund, is known for the phrase:

**""I spend all my time thinking about looming disaster""**

In fact, a [Forbes profile from 2011](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0627/money-guide-11-spitznagel-black-swan-cnbc-protect-tail.html#5349ecbe3857) claims that on roughly 95 trades out of 100 they lose money, yet Spitznagel is unruffled as he sits in his office listening to classical music and losing money each day.

**To simplify, here's the essence of how it works:**

**Universa purchased far out-of-the-money ""put"" options on stocks and broad market indices.**

**A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a set price within a specified time period. It's a bet that a stock or market is going down.**

As it is ultimately a bet, it is a very attractive market for degenerate gamblers!

If the market price falls below the agreed-upon price, you make money.

Universa makes a lot of small bets and watches most of them go bad (hence the 95 out of 100 trades they lose money line).

However, when one hits, it hits big...

**For example, back in September 2008, when the S&amp;P 500 was trading around 1200, Universa bought S&amp;P 500 Index put options with a strike price of 850, due to expire late October.**

**They were betting an ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù drop would occur.**

**They paid around 90 cents for those options. By October 10th, the S&amp;P had dropped 300 points in a month. The options Universa purchased for 90 cents were now trading for $60 each. Universa cashed out of its position around $50, good for a gain of 5455%.**

Now, as a reminder, this is a hedge - investors will have a relatively minimal percentage of their portfolio in Universa.

Essentially, the fund is designed to make an absolute killing if the market crashes and therefore ensures that their investors have insurance if the market suddenly nosedives.

Speaking of diving, let's take a dive into the [Investor Letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/455607584/Universa-Letter-April-2020#download&amp;from_embed):

In what has been a terrible period for many investors, this is what Universa investors were greeted with on the first page:

**Based on your required invested capital at the start of the year, in March 2020 you experienced a 3,612% net return on capital; year-to-date you have experienced a 4,144% net return on capital.**

Spitznagel then flexes The Risk Mitigation Scorecard, which showed that a portfolio invested 96.7% in the S&amp;P 500 and *just 3.3%* in Universa's Tail Hedge fund, would have had a positive return in March, a month when the S&amp;P dropped 12.4%.

The same portfolio - which eliminates the adverse effect on compounding from downside shocks - would have produced a 11.5% CAGR since inception in March 2008 versus 7.9% for the S&amp;P 500.

(CAGR just means Compound Annual Growth Rate)

I mentioned eliminating the adverse effect of compounding from downside shocks, well this is crucial and he makes a great point here:

**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses - and** ***not even*** **the big or small gains.**

This goes back to Warren Buffett's wise words:

**""Rule number one: Never lose money**

**Rule number two: Never forget rule number one""**

1587457615,0,1,"I want to tell you all about my experience with a very particular crypto currency, I am talking about [Banano](https://banano.cc/) (BAN).

I approached his ecosystem on tiptoe and doubtful about what I could find, both for the price of the coin and for the possible community; the first time I jumped in the eye I was reading an article on PUBLISH0X and I see myself passing through the feed a post of this singular crypto.

By accessing the site I immediately notice that it is rich in potassium, it has a very cool yellow logo and that it is not a shit coin (until you digest).

I am blown away, but intrigued I scroll, I arrive directly at the social links and I discover with pleasure that there is an English and even an Italian telegram community, I begin to interact and I am welcomed with open arms and literally with rain of bananas!

Yes, because one of the singularities of this crypto lies in the social tipbots, with which you can send BAN simply with a line in chat. From a technical point of view, to make a long story short, you can imagine the merger between the DOGE meme coin for the light-heartedness of the community and the general feeling of euphoria in the environment, mixed with the DAG nano technological infrastructure of which it is fork, thus bringing with it speed , security and decentralization, an important feature to be underlined is that it is possible to make available to medical research centers the processing power of the miner network to facilitate research in the medical field.


Returning to the beating heart community and my personal experience, once I joined the telegram group I was invited to join also on discord, I did not like it, I had never used it and I could not digest its method of use, but I tried, I it was said that it was the best place, but that only by becoming citizens could I receive the prizes, I decided to try it even if confused and in a few days I found myself in a place out of the dimension of time and met people ...

The thing that most shocked me positively in this crazy world in its own right is the peaceful and filterless coexistence that sometimes also leads to discussions and pacification between people of the most diverse ethnic groups and cultures who always in respect of others share thoughts and spaces of writing between games, contests and coin showers.

The only common feeling is fun and these cryptocurrency tips become over time, they are comparable to a friendly greeting, to a virtual hug, to a kiss, to the display of affection for a stranger who shares a thought outside of space and within the limits of time, a surreal but tangible world!

I invite you to think then, focusing your thoughts and closing your eyes, arrived at this point, at the thought that what is sent is actually virtual money, so imagine going to these people on the street completely unknown or almost unknown, and giving a pat on their shoulder or an embrace by placing coins or banknotes in their pockets, a utopian vision perhaps, but that is what happens on the practical side of things, and the members of the community do it with all possible love as a sign of friendship and sharing. It made me think a lot about this thought and I will take it with me as one of the most positive things that the internet and technology has brought us because I am sure that blockchain will help people both emotionally and financially.

So I invite you to consider entering this world, even on tiptoe and then choosing whether to remain marginally out of it or to be part of it.",CryptoCurrency,My Travel To Banano ecosystem

1. How are these IMAP attacks even possible? Wouldn't someone need access to a device of mine? I only use this email on a handful of devices I keep close.

2. Is there any way to completely disable these attacks? It's ridiculous they had complete access to my email despite me having 2fa enabled. 

3. Why doesn't Microsoft warn you someone has free access to your emails? They can just casually connect, bypassing 2fa and giving an illusion of safety without any prompts or warnings.

4. When the attackers were synced, could they also download files stored in my email? Or could they only read text?

I never connected to an IMAP protocol in my life and I find it surprisingly hard to find an explanation to any of these questions.

It saw Bitcoin rise to $20,000, Ethereum to $1,420 and a plethora of newly-launched ICO projects experience gains of up to 3,000%.

More than two years later, Bitcoin has failed to breach its previous all-time high while the likes of Ethereum continue to trade 80% lower than it once was.

However, 2020 has caused a newfound sense of optimism across the industry, which has been highlighted by a dramatic rise in prices across the board in the first six weeks of the year.

Information is power as we all know and the video you put up here reveals that as well. Bitcoin has been the trend of late and many people are still ignorant of this wealth creation technique. I was trading for loss previously because I was not having the required knowledge, skills, and experience on how to trade. 

It was a devastating experience but I was not relented because I am a great believer of the Bitcoin movement and trading at loss should not be what will weigh me down. 

My effort was recompensed  when I found Coinshield limited on Google. Shortly afterwards, I was able to recover all that I have lost due to my wrong trading strategies implemented before.

I got some ZRX last year and had been holding. it started to pump these last couple days and I figured a decent time to take profit. went to my compound app and withdrew to metamask. from my metamask (on cell) I was going to send to my coinbase account (on pc). I started to send the transaction and when metamask asked for a recipient address I scanned the qr code on my account and sent $1800.

so I wait a few minutes and see the confirmation but nothing in the account. refresh after a few minutes and still nothing. mind you coinbase is recovering from being down and deposits/withdrawals of tokens are delayed. so im trying to be patient but im nervous, I start going through the transaction and see the address is different than my wallet's and it looks like I sent $353 instead of $1800. it look like the recipient was the token itself? I have no idea why it didn't just go to my address and since transactions are irreversible im pretty sure im out of luck. I have pics of all the steps I took, if anyone could explain/point me in the right direction that'd be great",CryptoCurrency,lost all my savings? thanks coinbase

tl;dr: mods are highly centralized and not truly accountable to anyone but reddit admins, tokens should on some level be implemented for community governance to prevent abuse.

Decentralization is the word, it's the main reason I'm such a big supporter of crypto and ethereum especially. I will always be in favor of pretty much any initiative that moves power out of the hands of the few and to the many. This is badly needed in a place like reddit, and Community Points could play a big role here if it's done right.

Why I write this post now is this [/r/SubredditDrama/comments/gjedc1/urootintootin\_putin\_exposes\_moderator\_monopoly\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/gjedc1/urootintootin_putin_exposes_moderator_monopoly_of/)

(for some reason automod is rejecting my post for not linking to np.reddit even when I am, sorry)

Basically, a dude exposes that the top subreddits are HIGHLY centralized into the hands of just a few mods and is suspended from all of these communities. WTF right? As it stands right now communities here basically have to have faith that their moderators won't be garbage, and if they are the only option is to move subs. Not the best outcome, fractures the community if it works, the shit mods retains power over anyone who is numb to the garbage and stays, which will always be a lot of people.

If these community points are implemented correctly, it could be arranged for mods to have some degree of accountability to their community. There would be other issues that would need to be addressed, such as the potential for centralization of tokens, but on /some/ level a layer of accountability to someone other than reddit admins can be added. Even the most basic token voting system would be 100% better than the level of accountability that exists now, and I'm sure a better system can be found.

So to the skeptics I ask you to please consider the decentralization potential of this initiative, and to everyone I ask to push for communities to make use of this potential as much as possible.",CryptoCurrency,Community Points/MOON like tokens could serve an important role in Decentralization and Accountability

""You recently initiated a transaction on Bitpanda which is still pending. We need your support in order to successfully complete this transaction.

As of January 2020, we are required by law to obtain proof of funds from you before we can execute your outstanding transaction.

A proof of funds (POF) is a document or a collection of documents showing the origin of financial resources which you have used for fiat deposits (i.e. deposits made in EUR, CHF, GBP and USD). The proof of funds also includes information concerning the origin of your cryptoassets which have been used for fiat withdrawals (i.e. withdrawals in EUR, CHF, GBP and USD).

Even though this may sound complicated, all you actually have to do is prove how you acquired the funds. Please note that the submitted documents must not only display your most recent deposit (or withdrawal), but also the sum of your previous transactions, i.e. all previous transactions up to the stated amount.

For example, we can accept the following documents (amongst others) to prove the origin of funds:
- Wage, salary or pension statements (no older than six months)
- Notarial proof of inheritance or a gift
- Proof of the sale of real estate
- Proof of earnings from renting and leasing
- Proof of earnings from fixed assets or shareholding
- Proof of the sale of shares in a company
- Proof of earnings from investments

Simply stating the source of the funds is not sufficient. The document must be sent to us as an attachment. Please send the required documents in the form of JPG/JPEG, PNG or PDF via the ‚ÄúProof of Funds‚Äù section of our contact form. Unfortunately, attachments in other formats cannot be processed.

We understand that it may not always be easy to provide all the evidence for this amount but we are required to request this proof by law. If you are unable to provide proof for this amount, please contact our support team directly via our contact form.

If required, further information on this topic can be found in our privacy policy under the heading ‚ÄúDetails to and proof of funds‚Äù and under point 2.7 of our terms &amp; conditions.

Please note that if we do not receive the above-mentioned documents we would need to refund the transaction in question and the usage of your account will be limited.

1593589269,18,1,"Lost Bitcoin! I felt the sky landed on my head, the earth moving faster, I can‚Äôt breathe.. black black‚Ä¶ Everything becomes black for a few moments I guess. Nothingness.

**I‚Äôm broke! Lost life savings Bitcoin. Lesson learned by losing all of it. I wish none of you lose anything by making similar mistakes, cause I know how it feels to be financially broken.**

Having one full Bitcoin has always been a lucrative dream for me. This started back in 2017, I have started earning cryptocurrencies through giveaways, airdrops, and bounties. As time goes, I learned more about Bitcoin and its potential possible value. I was dreaming to accumulate at least one full Bitcoin and hold them until 2025. Soon, I understood this way it‚Äôs impossible to get that amount of BTC. So I aim for something big and got rekt by some masternode scams. Not to mention, I was trapped by the high ROI staking/masternode rewards and lost most of my earnings in late 2018. Well, I felt like death and broken as fuck for the first time. The amount wasn‚Äôt big for most of you, but since I‚Äôm living in a third world country, 0.4 BTC is really huge to me, it can feed me over eight months.

Fast forward a few weeks, I got my mental stability back and started working again.

I won my first biggest giveaway paid in Bitcoin was $500 worth at the winning time (if I remember correctly). Won some altcoins too from airdrops and bounties. The largest bounty amount in a single token was $770 worth when I traded. With all the effort, I was able to gather $900 worth BTC after cutting my expenses. Still, a long way to go to make the dream come true.

April 2019, I made the hardest decision of my life and put all my bank savings in Bitcoin using LocalBitcoin. Converted other crypto earning to BTC and put all of them in a single wallet. When I got one Bitcoin it was worth around $5300 USD.

I thought I wouldn‚Äôt touch that fund until 2025, but the scenario has changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone is affected by the pandemic and so does I. I made an even harder decision again, that I‚Äôm going to spend my saved Bitcoin.

I got shocked when I tried to restore my wallet using the 12-word phase. Mismatch!! I got a real shake somewhere inside my chest, saying wtf. Ok I tried once again, and it shows incorrect error. I felt the sky landed on my head, the earth moving faster, I can‚Äôt breathe.. black black‚Ä¶ Everything becomes black for a few moments I guess.

I give it a couple of tries again and got the same result. I asked myself, why this happening wrongly? Either I wrote words incorrectly or somehow mixed the word serial. Whatever, My BTC has gone away forever leaving her memories with me. Now all I have is this screenshot which I sent to my sister to show off. I‚Äôm totally broke now, everything feels like blank, nothingness.

**What was my fault?**
Deleting the wallet from my device was my first mistake. Second mistake I didn‚Äôt cross check everything before delete it. Third, I wrote the 12-words in my diary, should have written at least one more place, so I might know what is missing in both.

**What lesson I have learned:**
1. Never put all funds in one wallet
2. Always double check secret words and verify before deleting the wallet/data
3. Never invest all savings in crypto.
4. Save secret keys more than one place

**Why I‚Äôm writing this and sharing it on the internet?**
I‚Äôm writing this just to reduce my frustration, get inspired with some positive comments. I‚Äôm no way intended to get funds from others. Your mental support will make me strong again to start all over again. But still want to buy me a beer?

1593589215,0,1,"Why update Ethereum? One problem of the Ethereum network that the update should solve is scalability. At the moment, its blockchain can perform to 15 transactions per second, which is over two times more than that of bitcoin. However, this speed is still not enough for a large number of users. For example, the Visa payment system can perform up to 24 thousand transactions per second.¬†

Adding an Optimistic Rollup technology will help to solve the scalability problem. According to Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, its implementation will occur after the network‚Äôs update and will increase its throughput to 1000 transactions per second.

[by StealthEX](https://preview.redd.it/fwdsshnz87851.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f63ee22e6fb8b46479ff5d6eaf206931006f9df)

Another solution to this problem is a change in the algorithm. Currently, Ethereum runs on the same protocol as Bitcoin, Proof-of-Work, confirmation of transactions in the cryptocurrency network occurs using the computing power of processors.

Using the Proof-of-Work algorithm limits the growth of the Ethereum network bandwidth. To withstand a large load, more miners are needed, but the growth of their number slows down since it becomes more difficult to mine cryptocurrency and, consequently, less profitable.

This is the reason the Ethereum development team is planning to switch to the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. Unlike the PoW, it does not require the use of computing power to confirm blocks. Instead of miners, transactions will be confirmed by validators. To become a validator, the user should have 32 ETH and install a special client. From a technical point of view, this is easier than buying mining devices and maintaining their functionality, as well as looking for access to cheap electricity. Thus, the system will no longer need expensive hardware.

The main solution to the scalability problem will be to implement sharding. Current Ethereum network is a unified database. After the update, the blockchain will be divided into autonomous, interacting blocks ‚Äî shards, each of which will process particular transactions and smart contracts, which, however, will be recognized by the entire Ethereum blockchain. Nodes that form the shard process information separately, this allows maintaining the principle of decentralization. This is important since the risk of centralization is another big problem of the old algorithm.

Since the complexity of mining has increased over time, and now this process requires having expensive equipment and access to cheap electricity, small participants can not afford to stay in the game. In such conditions, big pools of miners that can provide higher productivity have a decisive advantage. For example, in April, more than 50% of the computing power of the Ethereum network was provided by only two mining pools. This creates a significant risk of centralization and ‚Äú51% attacks‚Äù.

Validators will confirm transactions and get rewards in the form of passive income. According to the project‚Äôs roadmap, this amount will vary from 1.81% to 18.1%. The profitability of the stacking will depend on the number of validators. The more of them, the smaller the amount they get. However, there will be some costs. In the same Ethereum 2.0 roadmap, developers mentioned that the cost of validating transactions, based on rough calculations, will be about $180 per year. One of the developers of the project, Justin Drake, predicts that on average the validator will receive an income of 5% per year.

# What is the estimated Ethereum 2.0 release date?

The launch of Ethereum 2.0 will take place gradually, in six stages, the ‚Äúzero‚Äù of which is expected this summer. However, it is worth noting that due to finding vulnerabilities, the dates have already been shifted several times‚Äìinitially, the transition to the new version was planned in 2019.

One of the developers of the project, Afri Schoedon, said that the launch could be postponed to 2021. According to him, under favourable circumstances, the main network can be presented in November of this year, but there are certain difficulties in this.

Schoedon explained that before launching ETH 2.0, all of its clients must be brought to the same specifications. After that, the developer‚Äôs team needs to open a unified deposit contract so that users can transfer their assets from the old chain to the new one. Between these stages, developers also need additional time, so they could test all aspects of the new system.

As it usually happens, there‚Äôs going to be two parallel blockchains as a result of the hard fork. The first one, ETH1, will continue to work using an old protocol, while the update will be implemented on ETH2. Users will be able to transfer their coins from the old blockchain to the new one, but not vice versa. The appearance of sharding will allow developers to move to phase 1.5 ‚Äî during this phase, ETH1 will merge with ETH2, becoming one of the 64 ‚Äúshards‚Äù of the updated blockchain. In the second phase, smart contracts become available on ETH2, which can be considered the full start of its economic activity.

# And what are expectations?

Updating the Ethereum network will increase its technical capabilities, namely, it will speed up and reduce the cost of transactions, as well as make the blockchain less vulnerable for centralization process.

Currently, the absolute majority of decentralized finance projects are developed using the Ethereum platform. The Ethereum 2.0 release will probably attract even more partners who will use the blockchain for their projects.

Ryan Watkins, Messari Analysis company‚Äôs researcher, highly values the importance of updating.

*‚ÄúETH 2.0 is a much stronger catalyst than the Bitcoin halving simply because it‚Äôs an uncertain and fundamental change.‚Äù* ‚Äî Ryan Watkins wrote on his Twitter account

And the part about uncertainty is hard to disagree with. Of course, there are some concerns about the bright Ethereum future. The coming hard fork carries with it potential negative consequences. For example, after switching to the PoS algorithm, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may well admit Ethereum as a security, which will lead to legal complications similar to those faced by Pavel Durov when trying to launch his TON blockchain platform.

For now, ETH is the most popular coin for mining at home, and most of these miners will probably just leave the network.

There is also a risk that the price of Ethereum may fall. To receive passive income for storing ETH, the user will not only need to have 32 coins but also block them through a special transaction. They will not be able to withdraw these blocked funds immediately.¬†As stated in the project roadmap, the cryptocurrency withdrawal process will take at least 18 hours. This could take even more time if many users request the return of tokens at the same time. Thus, if ETH falls in price, it will be impossible to sell it immediately, and there is a risk of losing some capital and all the income received from stacking.

Nevertheless, investors are mostly optimistic ‚Äî the volume of Ethereum options on the Deribit exchange has grown to a historical high, which indicates confidence in the future of Ethereum project. The ETH price is also growing, having overcome the consequences of the March collapse of cryptocurrencies.¬†

Most experts agree that Ethereum price will grow after the update. On the one hand, the altcoin will become more expensive, as it will become a more attractive investment. On the other hand, the offer will decrease, as users will start transferring coins from the first version of the network to the second, to block them for passive income.

-Since 2/18/20, every day I have featured a new crypto of the day for us to discuss. I try to make follow up posts within a week, but I am behind at the moment. I try to mix in the most popular projects, along with some long shots. Sometimes I even feature projects I personally am not a fan of, just for the sake of conversation. I feel it is important for us to focus on the pros and cons of all projects, even if that sometimes means playing devil's advocate. At this point, I plan to try to continue making these posts until I have completed a full year.¬†

-If you decide to reply, please add something more than, ""scam"" or ""this coin will moon to $1000 by the end of 2020"". Please say why. If it is a scam, link or show evidence. If you feel it is a true moonshot, what makes this project special with that sort of potential? It seems many people within this community only promote projects they are financially invested in, while trash talking coins they do not hold bags.¬†


-I strongly encourage everyone to follow up on past discussions and you can still make comments on them. There is a lot of valuable information on many of these posts, so please check them out as you have time. You may learn a lot regarding some of these projects. I know I certainly did!

1602226530,8,1,"From the vast stores of knowledge and experience here, I wonder if anyone has ever come across an effort to create a token, or maybe an interface or environment, where people totally new to crypto could engage in buying, selling, exchanging, and using tokens but without needing to buy them to begin with?

I wondered about this because as a newbie it took me weeks of trial and error, and learning about gas, and figuring out how to connect wallets to exchanges and vaults, and how to send and receive and move things around, etc. in order to really understand what I was doing, and it wasn't cheap to go through that. It felt like an educational process that could have been accomplished without losing along the way. I would have really loved to be able to learn all of this using a training token, an educational token... 

So I was thinking how great it would have been if, as a person new to crypto currencies, I could have practiced all of this without having to essentially throw away money on fees for buying and exchanging, and on gas. Though I suppose if someone made a token for this purpose, you would think that it would still need to pay its way somehow - but it could also be something that people donate small percentages of computational time to, in order to get crypto more mainstreamed, and making dipping your toes into it something that doesn't require what often feels like throwing money away while you learn and make initial mistakes.",CryptoCurrency,Token/coin for learning how to use tokens and coins...

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/

click price and mcap for 3 months and they have increased their supply by 50%.

pumps and dumps often follow teather printing, i keep an eye on their supply, its never organic; huge jumps etc. What follows is usually some market instability, pump and dump. in this case they did the old trick, they bought btc and sold alts off, people are now buying alts again and probably thier operation.

tether is shady and centralised,  so i woudlnt be surprised if this was their operation.

i posted about an article below about tether, with a few main take aways that it's not only not backed by USD but is used as a tool to manipulate the market especially BTC.

It will lead to moons for adoption as I have seen people even find it difficult to sell or buy but we will be integrating moons to our platform. And we will promise you to give the best rates defeating the market.

But before we start I have a few questions to ask you guys.

I am still thinking about the platform name. Can you guys suggest to me some good name that is short, easy to remember, and related to the travel keywords?

And what you guys wanna see on the platform like any other feature that you don't get on other travel platforms or some features that should be on every travel platform.

*'Contrary to what some people may assume, there is no official hard cap on the amount of ETH. While proof-of-work will be replaced by proof-of-stake in the future, Ethereum will continue to be inflationary as a result. Unlike Bitcoin, with its 21 million hard cap, Ethereum has no fixed maximum supply. This means the value of every individual ETH lowers every time a new coin is brought into circulation. In this regard, Ethereum is quite similar to fiat currencies, even though its level of inflation is significantly lower.'*

Eth is my second biggest holding after Bitcoin. I was aware of the fact that there is no hard cap when I invested in it, so I'm not posting this to in any way criticize it. But I expect there are people out there who would find reason to be concerned about investing in a cryptocurrency without a limit in its supply. I'm sure Vitalik has very good reasons for not imposing a hard cap, reasons far beyond grandma's understanding, which is why I'm posting this here, for those who understand the tech better to help enlighten me (and others like me), so I'd love to know what the community thinks.

Is having no hard cap a good or a bad thing (both for the network and as an investment)?

What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Is a hard cap likely to be introduced sometime in the future?

Kernel Vaults is launching KERNEL, a **non-inflationary cryptocurrency** designed to build a decentralized hedge fund.

Leveraging the non-inflationary tokenomics brought by CORE, KERNEL ecosystem will enable farmers (LP stakers) to benefit from a 1% additional transaction fee on every KERNEL transaction but also from the performances of a decentralized hedge fund that will execute secure yield strategies based on lending and liquidity providing.

**What are the main advantages of this project?**

* **Non-inflationary yield:** As Kernel will use the tokenomics brought by CORE, there will be no inflation. For those who never heard about CORE, yield farming without inflation is possible thanks to an additional fee on transactions. KERNEL adds a 1% fee on all KERNEL transactions and redistributes this fee as follows :

&amp;#x200B;

|Stakeholders|Earned percentage of the fees|
|:-|:-|
|KERNEL LP Stakers|88%|
|Hedge Fund|8%|
|Devs|4%|

&amp;#x200B;

* **Floor price:**  KERNEL will be launched through an LGE that will set a floor price for KERNEL. What does it mean? KERNEL WILL NEVER FALL UNDER THIS PRICE, this is by design (*how is it possible? I will explain it later in this post*). This floor price will enable a new lending system where fair loans and collaterals staking are possible.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Fair loans:** Basically, anyone will be able to borrow DAI with KERNEL as collaterals.  KERNEL being used as collateral allows the loan to value (maximum amount of DAI that can be borrowed for a given amount of deposited KERNEL) to lean on its floor price making lending risk-free by design.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Collaterals staking:**  KERNEL will allow LP owners to deposit their LP as collaterals to borrow DAI. The contracted loan will be reimbursed with yield rewards (it can be seen as a yield payment advance).

&amp;#x200B;

* **Hedge fund:**  The Hedge fund filled by FoT will execute secure yield strategies based on stable coin lending and liquidity providing.  **All the fees perceived by the hedge fund are always compounded, while the generated yield is distributed among stakers.**  The hedge fund is designed for the longterm, its generated yield should increase over time and easily exceed its 8% share of the fees.  After a first liquidity cap has been achieved, the fund's first strategy will be to lend on Kernel lending vaults, enabling people to take loans using KERNEL or KERNEL LP as collaterals.

**What are the challenges of this project?**

The concept and ideas are really great and interesting, however, it will be possible to deposit KERNEL LP as collaterals to borrow DAI only after several months, not at the start of the project as it is necessary to have a certain APY record track to implement them. Hence, the project needs to still attract enough investors in the first few months to fill the Hedge fund.

Another challenge for the team to overcome is to keep a decent volume of transactions so that the KERNEL LP stakers are incentivized to stake. In a medium article, the KERNEL team explains that they will create several pairs (but only one per dex) to create more arbitrage opportunities, which means a higher volume of transactions.

**What about KERNEL distribution?**

Kernel Vaults kickstarts KERNEL distribution through a Liquidity Generation Event. To participate in the LGE, investors will have to deposit DAI on the KERNEL Fair Launch smart contract via the event page on [kernelvaults.finance](https://kernelvaults.finance). **The launch date has not been determined yet.**

Compared to other non-inflationary DeFi projects, KERNEL will use DAI for its LGE and lending system, to guarantee a secure floor price that will not be exposed to ETH price fluctuations which is good for those who are looking for a more option that other project using the same model of tokenomics.

The contributed DAI will be matched with the 10,000 KERNEL and added to the Uniswap liquidity pool forever. The participants of the LGE will receive the generated KERNEL/DAI LP tokens according to their respective share of the pooI.

**The 10,000 KERNEL tokens will be locked forever as liquidity with the DAI raised during the LGE, setting a floor price for KERNEL that can be calculated as follow:** ***Total DAI raised/KERNEL total supply.***

The advantage of such a distribution is that it is fair as there are no pre-sale, pre-mine tokens, or a big part of the supply distributed to the KERNEL team. The supply will be 10,000 KERNEL forever, no mint will be possible. **Note, however, that the code is still not released and should be released according to the team before the beginning of the LGE.**

I found this project interesting even though it is still in its nascent days, that is why I wanted to share it here and hear your thoughts.

1609487491,95,1,"Here are 5 resolutions to make 2021 your best year.

1. **Waste less time.** 
Got Netflix? Cancel it. Facebook? Delete it. Twitter? Get rid of it. Instagram? Stop it. Reddit? Skip it.
 Apart from the negative influence a lot of these media have, it's often a horrible waste of time.
 Americans spend on average [1471 hours] (https://www.mandatory.com/living/1478185-social-media-wasting-time) a year watching tv.
 Malcolm Gladwell stated that it takes 10.000 hours or practice to become an expert at something. Didn't read the book, but I gave my own twist to it: I combine it with the [pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and I come to the conlusion that it takes only 80 hours to get 50% of the expert level. So yeah, let's be conservative and let's say it takes 100 hours to be decent at something.
 Then, go ahead, get decent at something instead of watching television. Learn to code. Learn a new language. Study nutrition. Try to master an instrument. Make your own furniture. *This is investing in yourself.*
 Waste less time on politics as well. The chance you will change something is very small anyway. Clean your own room first.

2. If the thing you picked up at #1 is not a physical activity, pick up one. Go lift, run, go play squash. It's healthy for both body and mind. Chop trees. Fix your garden. Not only does this make your body release nice hormones and improve your physique, it also decreases the chance of getting Alzheimer's later in life.* This is investing in yourself.*

3. **Waste less money.** Boosting your savings rate with [15% means you can stop working 8(!) years earlier](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). So again, cancel that Netflix membership and skip that McDonalds meal for a nice homecooked one. This is investing in yourself.

4. Allocate some money to 'high-risk' investments. Buy Bitcoin, smart people do. Buy [Coinbase before the IPO](https://warosu.org/biz/thread/S25039356). We are in a bullmarket and the FED is printing like crazy. Cash is trash.
You are scared of a loss? The dollar lost 10% ytd versus the euro.... and versus bitcoin? More than 70% loss.

5. Make someone's day more often. Call your mother.

Scroll to the bottom for the TLDR

So. I had some XRP on CoinBase I was trying to get off for the longest time but kept running into errors about wrong wallet address when I know how to use the copy/paste. I was trying to move it to my holding wallet, Exodus. 

Somewhat recently, I started using NiceHash for BTC mining, and they have their own wallets of course. So I thought ‚Äúok. Let‚Äôs move from CoinBase to NiceHash, then to Exodus to see if that‚Äôll work‚Äù. Going thru the steps on the NiceHash site, I copy the wallet address and destination tag to CoinBase, and it works perfectly. 

Then I go to move it from NiceHash to Exodus, and when NiceHash asks for the destination tag, it says to put ‚Äú0‚Äù if your wallet doesn‚Äôt support the tags. 

Quick google:  exodus doesn‚Äôt have destination tags, address is enough....doesn‚Äôt click just yet. 

I can‚Äôt withdraw the funds just yet as I just turned on 2FA for NiceHash so I can‚Äôt move funds out for 24 hours. NBD. 

Get up from computer...go to use the bathroom.....and it clicks. If I‚Äôd done the damn googling properly before I would‚Äôve known to put ‚Äú0‚Äù on CoinBase to move it straight to Exodus. 

*facepalm*

TLDR for anyone new or new-ish like me:

In late May of 2017 he and his community got the idea to buy up a shitcoin called Chaincoin, pump up the price and then hodl the coin. The coin supported masternodes so the idea was that if they bought up the supply and nobody sold they could sit on it and collect dividends. As they bought it up and the price started pumping FOMO started to set in and the idea spread like a wildfire. The Chaincoin fans created a dedicated slack channel which got really active, though the feed was mostly a stream of emojis and users shouting ‚ÄúTO THE MOOOON‚Äù ‚Äúonly weak hands sell‚Äù and ‚Äúbuild a buy wall!‚Äù as they tried to pump the price to $100. The coin lacked fundamentals so experienced crypto traders seemed pretty skeptical but if they spoke out against it they were told to stop spreading FUD and were banned. Any videos that were critical of the idea would also get brigaded. The coin pumped from .10 to 1.40, then fell back down to around .40 before blasting off to over 6.00! However, the people who bought in low started taking profits and the price dropped quickly which triggered a panic sell - especially because it had attracted so many new people into crypto who bought in high and didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. It wasn‚Äôt long before the pumpers had invested too much money and couldn't afford to keep propping it up artificially so the price tanked. A lot of people got burned really badly in the process, I remember a lot of tears and breakdowns. Afterwards the token laid in the dirt as an abandoned broken husk and it never recovered. 

This was one of my early introductions to crypto and I remember being completely caught up in the hype. What I didn‚Äôt understand at the time was that if a project is really solid and if it solves a problem then it doesn‚Äôt need to be pumped artificially, it will get a following and the support will grow organically. My advice to new traders who might be caught up in the recent pump frenzy is to be wary and make sure you do your due diligence before investing because in this space there‚Äôs always someone trying to shill you on the next big thing.",CryptoCurrency,Anyone from 2017 remember Chaincoin?

Now, data has revealed hedge funds are short bitcoin to the tune of more than $1 billion, even as retail traders pile into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Hedge funds have been increasing their bitcoin short positions-effectively bets that the price of an asset will fall-since the bitcoin price began climbing in October, data from crypto news and analysis company The Block showed.

MORE FOR YOU. The net short position in bitcoin futures is now the biggest it has ever been, according to the CFTC's latest Traders in Financial Futures report.

The bitcoin price has soared around 200% since October, surging to over $40,000 per bitcoin before falling back slightly.

As hedge funds increasingly bet against the bitcoin price, to some extent covering their long positions, retail traders empowered by apps and bored by lockdowns are speculating on bitcoin and everything else.

""Investor attitudes are being shaped by the headline-making gains of some high-profile issues. For example, the 35% gain made by bitcoin in the first nine days of 2021, on the heels of a fivefold surge in price from March to December 2020; or the more-than-sixfold increase in GameStop shares in less than two weeks to January 26; or even Tesla, now the fifth-largest stock in the S&amp;P 500 by market capitalisation, with a market cap larger than that of the major U.S., European, and Japanese automakers combined.""

1612943955,11,8,"**Update and Intro..**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so I posted this a few months ago, pondering on how fast we could make 1 btc by farming sushi on sushiwap with $100k invested.

[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kgo4qb/defi\_experiment\_how\_long\_will\_it\_take\_to\_earn\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kgo4qb/defi_experiment_how_long_will_it_take_to_earn_an/)

You will see my conclusion was that it would take 2.63 years to farm a single bitcoin, but perhaps 1.6 years if we took into account compounding etc.

Well... things have changed baby.  Sushi has gone from a mere $2.2 to $14.90 in that space, and BTC has obviously skyrocketed too.  So time to update my post below, with the same comments but stats updated to show current rates.

So this is partly a copy and paste with updated stats... but first of all an update.  I kept farming the pools in my link until BTC started its super run past 20k.  At that point I exited by pools completely and went into 100% BTC.  Once the dust settled I resumed my farming, but JUST with the WBTC / ETH pool.  So in a way, this is the most conservative pool out of many.

I have chosen the most ""boring"" pool because I wanted to retain exposure to BTC, and the two coins are usually correlated in price so I could avoid impermanent loss (or so I thought - see below).

And as noted in my earlier post, I don't have exactly $100k invested - it is more or less than that, but I have scaled the investment for an earlier read.  I re-entered 31 December NZD time.  So we are just 42 days in but that gives us lots of yummy data! (And yummy sushi!)

So here are the stats!

**Caveats**

But first some caveats:

1. The biggest one is that this is based on five  weeks of data. The price of coins and even volumes or yields WILL change, so we are speculating here that things continue as normal. So there is a degree of crystal ball gazing.
2. I have not put exactly $100,000 in. It is either more or less (prefer not to say), but I have simply adjusted my numbers up to down to match $100,000. The records scale linearly so we can still show the same results. So put $200,000 in and your figures should double.
3. I have not shown gas fees which will cost me about $150 (previously only $30!!!) to enter and exit my positions. So this makes a very small position unviable.
4. As noted below, around two thirds of my income is deferred by 6 months. This is quite huge, so effectively we have to take this into account if we actually wanted to buy a bitcoin with our returns.
5. I have not included taxes in my calculations, because this stuff is hard enough already!!!!
6. I may have made a math mis-calculation at some point, if so, let me know!

**Returns**

So down to the numbers. I am just in one main liquidity pool WBTC / Eth.  I do wish I had remained in the SUSHI / ETH pool but I don't have a time machine and I still have all my earlier gains from that pool!

So, we have at least five returns to measure:

1. The gains from the pool coins itself;
2. The fees we generate from being a liquidity pool provider;
3. The sushi coins we farm from being a liquidity pool provider (1/3 are granted immediately, the rest vest over 6 months)
4. Apparently there is a polkadot sushi platform launching which will retroactively award ""moon sushi"" to LP providers. I don't know more than that, so there is a hidden bonus we can't yet quantify.  This appears on their roadmap for 2021, so I hope to have this airdrop later this year.
5. NEW - I am staking my sushi earned in the 'sushi bar' so I earn an additional dividend on top of everything else, as I receive a share of the total trading fees earned from the entire platform.

**Tracking**

Tracking your yields and gains / losses is critical. I use these three sites to do so (these aren't links but you can find them fast):

\- zapper fi (this shows your yield farm returns)

\- App boring finance (this shows locked / vested rewards and is handy for checking my sushi staking rewards)

\- APY Vision (this one is handy for monitoring impermanent loss)

**Initial Investment**

So on 29 December 2020 $100,000 invested in this fashion into two pools would look like this:

ETH / WBTC pool = 1.71106 WBTC and 65.369 ETH = $100,000

Remember, as time goes by, these balances will change and I will start to own more of the coin that performs worse in each pool. If the price changes too much I can get the dreaded impermanent loss that might make my fees a negative!)

Note that I picked these pools because Sushi allocates bonuses to certain pools. This pool has had a farming bonus for quite some time. If this goes away, I might need to change pools.

**Results after five weeks**

So the results are in after a \[EVEN MORE\] crazy five weeks and let's see what our pools look like. APY vision will even tell us exactly how much they have changed, and the total result of fees and impermanent loss.

*First..... the total values of the pool:*

ETH / WBTC Pool = $195,764.   Wow!  Nearly a double in value in a month, but most of that are gains from ETH and BTC.

So we are up nearly $96k just on the pool values. But most of this is just because crypto has mooned over the last five weeks. So how do our balances compare vs having just HODLed the coins?

&amp;#x200B;

So, APY Vision tells us that: -

* We gained .3986 WBTC but
* We lost 11.25 ETH
* for a total of a $1,940 LOSS (that is, compared to if I had just stayed out).

So that is a total from fees of a $1,940 loss. How can that possibly be? This is the dreaded impermanent loss I mentioned, which has exceeded the fees I actually earned. This is mostly from Ethereum doing very well vs BTC in the last five weeks, something I hope to reverse soon....

And at one point the IP loss was closer to $4,600!!!!

So having lost money (plus gas fees) from being a LP provider let's hope the farming rewards are good....

*Second... the farming rewards*

This is fairly easy to check via our ""boring finance"" app I mentioned above. Critically it shows our locked / vested Sushi which is not easily visible otherwise.

It tells us we have earned a total of 542 sushi. With a value of $8,397 - yay!

So less our impermanent loss and we have a reward of $6,456 for our efforts over five weeks. Plus the $97k or so capital gain on the funds.

Now WITHOUT the farming rewards our situation would be a bit hopeless. That might be the situation if we had tried this on Uniswap - although on Uniswap pool providers receive the entire 0.5% trading fee, vs only 0.3% on Sushi. But its pretty clear that we are only in this game for sushi.

**Staking Sushi**

Unlike last time, I am now harvesting and staking my sushi for a share of passive income - this is slow (but as they say in the meme, ""its not much, but its honest work""

Our sushi is staked gradually, every 2 weeks or so.  Having staked a total of 146.1 sushi, we have earned a total of... wait for it... 1 sushi.  Well that is $15 or so for free, but I do worry about the gas costs of having to continually withdraw and enter.  Still, its better than just doing nothing with it - but maybe I should have pooled this into the ETH / SUSHI pool.

**Extrapolating Forward**

So in five  weeks our yield was $6,456 - or 6.45% of our initial investment.   An insane return.  But closer to 3.2% of our CURRENT investment value.

Taking into account all my caveats above, we get a very simple calculation whereby we would hit 1 BTC value if we repeated this 7.125 times - 35.62 weeks, or  0.68 years.  So that is a HUGE improvement of my last calculation where I said it would take  2.63 years!!

But think about the daily gain.  That is 15.48 sushi a day - or $240 a day!!!!   ($80 alone when you sleep....)

And there is a final (positive) caveat. None of this takes into account compounding returns. That is, once I harvest my sushi, I have several options:

1. Reinvest back into a pool
2. Stake the sushi for ""x-sushi"" that will give me a flow of trading profits from all the other pools (see above)
3. Sell into something else and try and trade, or earn passive income via CEFI platforms like Celsius, or maybe lend my coins via DEFI.

So in theory, this might multiple the gains and get us to our target faster. Over a 1.49 year period, harvesting and reinvesting every month or so would SUBSTANTIALLY increase our gains. So maybe closer to 1 year.

And of course if the value of the sushi token increases, the calculations get much better (just compare to the original post I linked above).  Equally if sushi falls and BTC runs, it becomes much harder.  But so far momentum is on sushi's side.

So I hope that was helpful. I would LOVE to know if anybody is having better success than I am with DEFI.",CryptoCurrency,"UPDATED for Feb 2021: Defi Experiment. How long will it take to earn an entire bitcoin from liquidity farming on Sushiswap with USD $100,000? Let's find out!"

1614325787,505,425,"So.. I'm a bit embarrased to write this, but if it prevents a single person from not losing money, it's worth it. Here goes.

I'm a student who had a bit of spare money which just kept sitting and depreciating on my savings account. I don't really need that money and it isn't anything lifechanging (I couldn't even buy a car with it), so I decided to go all-in in crypto. I picked DOT for sensible risk-reward ratio. Things have been going great, when DOT peaked I doubled my money. I wanted to sell something to buy a new laptop at that point but my DOT was locked in staking and, more impornantly, I had a huge exam coming.

When things were crashing for a few days I finally decided to unstake a third of my holdings - unstaking period on Binance is 2 days, my 60 DOTs arrived yesterday. After I passed (hooray!) the exam, I was really exctasic, and so was crypto, for that matter. I was convinced BTC was now safely above 50K USD. I hade prior experience with leverage trading, It always went like this: **made money -&gt; got greedy -&gt; increased leverage -&gt; lost everything.** Total amount lost is like 150 USD - so nothing terrible - but my potential profits (if a pulled the trigger) were in 1-2K USD area. That sucked but at least it wasn't my money.

I didn't really like the idea of selling my DOT as I truly believe in it's future - but i found something called futures. Didn't realy understand it but aparantelly there is also a possibility to leverage trade with your tokens (instead of USD) as collateral. That sounded great, were finally recovering from the crash to 45K USD, why not make a bit of extra money?

I started with 3x leverage, nothing crazy and plenty of cushioning if shit hits the fan. In a few hours I made profit made a profit of 10 DOT or 340 USD - that's crazy, I'm from Europe and this is more than I made at my part time job for all of February! I was really pleased with myself, I passed the exam, my girlfriend came over and now this.

This all happened after 4 sleepless nights, I was really nervous about that exam and couldn't sleep. Finally, I decided to go in bed - and my stupid ass opened another leveraged trade, after all, BTC was now stable, right? I woke up 9 hours later, BTC meanwhile dropped from 51 do 47K and my long trade lost value from 70 DOTs to 30. I could have swalloved it and cut my losses but I didn't, of course.

In the next few hours I opened and closed many long/short trades with increesing leverage, just trying to save what lost. That didn't work. It never works - especially when greed and panic takes over. During the course of writing my post a lost last 12 DOT on overleveraged trade in the final attempt to break even. I didn't even care about it - despite 12 DOT being more than I make in a month.

I'm feeling like shit right now, called my girlfriend who is really awesome and managed to improve my mood a bit. Also I still have 2/3 of my DOT holdings, I'm not in a loss - but my P/L is really close to 0 now. Decided to withdraw the rest from staking and will concider selling some of it if the market rises again. That said, I can't imagine how this possible feels when you loose your family savings or even take a loan to trade crypto.

I guess the bottom line is this: **Don't be greedy**. It's not that hard to make more money out of it but you get in a never ending downvard spiral - always wanting more, more, more... Also, there are more important things in life than money - one of them is mental health. If you get severely depressed as a result of investing in crypto, it isn't worth it. I don't care what you say, it just isnt.

I'm sorry for a chaotic post but I really wanted to get it out of my self. Leverage trading is shit. Market will recover, your losses won't. Please, spread the FUD about leverage trading, I'm going to go for a walk now. Also, I'm sure there are far worse stories than mine - I'd be happy to hear them if you got over it and want to further encourage people not to do this.

Stay strong.

1614326781,22,5,"Everyone talks about 'Only invest what you can afford to lose' as pretty much the only form of managing risk in crypto investing. I'd like to share a few more thoughts on some techniques that I learned from doing FOREX trading back in 2013. TLDR at the bottom.

1) The Risk/Reward Ratio. We all want to maximize our rewards, but are you managing the other side of the coin - your risk. Let's say you invested in bitcoin back in 2019 when it was about $3000, if you took profit at $48K your R:R would be 1:15. Even if you took profit at the previous ATH ($20k) that would still have been a 1:5.5 R:R. That's huge returns compared to the risk.

But what about if you entered at $20k during the breakout. That's only about a 1:1.25 R:R. You basically risked an amount to earn the same amount. Depending on the person, those gains may not have been worth the risk. So you can either hodl for a higher R:R or wait for dips (or bear market) to enter again.

Basically, the rule here is to find an R:R that you're comfortable with before you enter or that you can DCA into.

2) Setting the target. In a bear market, it's easier to set your target to the ATH for a good R:R. But as we've seen in BTC, crypto seems to break ATH and enter price discovery mode. Since the top is pretty much anyone's guess, let's just do it a bit arbitrarily at $90k and introduce our next concept.

3) Setting your stop loss. Let's use the previous example, you are up 15x from investing in BTC from $3000 which is now at $48k. You think it will reach $90k - about a 30x gain from your initial investment. You can still apply R:R here. 

The question then is: What % of your gains are you comfortable losing to hit your target? In this example, what are you comfortable losing to get to that extra 15x? Are you comfortable losing 3x, 5x or 10x? You can set your stop loss there to secure gains that you can use IRL or to invest more during a dip/bear market. Comfortable losing everything? Don't bother with stop losses and just hodl.

So that's it for now. I guess the concern here is that stop losses are for coins in exchanges. And most of the community are hodling in their wallets for good reason. 

Thoughts? Do you think these concepts apply to crypto or your investment strategy?

On February 21, a writer, Leung, published a comprehensive study that looks at the possibility of Sassaman being Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Coincidently two months before Sassaman died, Nakamoto left the crypto community saying probably he won't be around in the future.

**Who is Len Sassaman?**

Sassaman (1980‚Äì2011) was one of the original cypherpunks and an advocate for privacy. According to his wife, he committed suicide on July 3, 2011. That year, Black Hat Briefings disclosed that a tribute to Sassaman was embedded into BTC blockchain.

Leung explains how the obituary is attached to the BTC network.

""Embedded on every single node of the Bitcoin network is an obituary,"" Leung wrote. ""It‚Äôs a memorial to Len Sassaman, a man essentially immortalized in the blockchain itself. A fitting tribute in more ways than one.""

According to a write-up on [*Bitcoin.com*](https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-pointing-to-cypherpunk-len-sassaman-being-satoshi-nakamoto/), Leung‚Äôs first piece of circumstantial evidence is the fact that Nakamoto quit the Bitcoin project and left the community two months before Sassaman passed away. Leung added that he was initially hesitant to speculate on Satoshi‚Äôs identity, but one Craig Wright‚Äôs claims made him believe the subject was important.

Sassaman was an advocate for privacy. He gravitated towards cryptography and protocol development. He was a PhD candidate at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium as a researcher with Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research group, led by Bart Preneel.

At 21, he also organised protests following the arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov. By 22, he already had the cryptography expertise to build the very foundations of Bitcoin, Bitcoin.com quotes the aforementioned study.

He was married to computer scientist Meredith L. Patterson. The couple worked together on several research collaborations. Sassaman also worked with popular Satoshi-suspect and now deceased Hal Finney.

**'Revisited topic' after a fraudulent claim**

""With Craig Wright fraudulently claiming credit and invoking a copyright claim to take down the Bitcoin whitepaper,"" Leung wrote, ""It's important we revisit the topic and recenter the discussion around the cypherpunks who actually built Bitcoin.""

*Bitcoin.com* quotes the study as saying that by the time Sassaman was 22, he already had the cryptography expertise to build the very foundations of Bitcoin. Another interesting fact about Sassaman was that he worked with popular Satoshi-suspect and now deceased Hal Finney.

Leung said Sassaman and Finney had one strong commonality ‚Äî developing anonymous remailer technology. Sassaman was the lead maintainer of Mixmaster anonymous remailer code and Randseed remailer.

**'Anonymous remailer'**

According to *Bitcoin.com*, an anonymous remailer is similar to a Bitcoin node, as it accepts messages and instructions on how to accept, store, and send them without revealing the origination point. The Bitcoin blockchain, however, processes these actions in a pseudo-anonymous fashion, making a BTC user as transparent or as anonymous as they desire.

The author further argued: Bitcoin‚Äôs architecture is very similar to that of remailers.

Leung also shows evidence of Sassaman collaborating with Blockstream CEO, Adam Back, when he listed him as a contributor to a research paper and in a Mixmaster memo, says *Bitcoin.com*.

Back has also been a suspect in Satoshi mystery, when a YouTube channel ""Barely Social"" published a video called ‚ÄúUnmasking Satoshi Nakamoto,‚Äù on May 11, 2020. Leung‚Äôs report notes, at one time Back ‚Äúsuggested that Satoshi might have been a remailer developer.‚Äù

""Unlike many cypherpunks discussed, we know that Len made extensive pseudonymous contributions to the cypherpunk mailing list via remailers,"" Leung insisted.

**Is Satoshi possibly an American academic who writes in British English?**

The study published on February 21 also details how Sassaman became a researcher and Ph.D. candidate at Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography Research Group (COSIC). Leung notes, ""Len‚Äôs Ph.D. advisor at COSIC was none other than 'father of digital currency' David Chaum.‚Äù

Leung also mentions Sassaman‚Äôs relationship with Bittorrent creator Bram Cohen ‚Äî they worked together on a project called Pynchon Gate.

Meanwhile, during the period (2008-2010), BTC was being developed and kick-started, Leung‚Äôs report notes that a few people have assumed that Nakamoto was an academic like Sassaman was during those years. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs an academic, maybe a post-doc, maybe a professor who just doesn‚Äôt want the attention,‚Äù early Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen said at one time.

""Satoshi‚Äôs code contributions and comments ramped up heavily during summer and winter break,"" Leung emphasised.

Moreover, because Sassaman was located in Belgium during Bitcoin‚Äôs development, it also coincides with the opinion that Satoshi was in Europe developing Bitcoin. Recent studies suggest Satoshi was creating the project in London, writes *Bitcoin.com*.

""Strangely enough, Len used the very same British English as Satoshi even though he was American,"" Leung detailed. ""Since COSIC was based in Leuven, Len was living in Belgium during Bitcoin‚Äôs development. This is salient given that a number of facts suggest that Satoshi was based in Europe,"" the study explains.

1617778131,7,1,"I'm curious to hear how people manage their portfolios. I hear quite a bit of people mentioning Dollar Cost Averaging, but hardly ever hear people talk about rebalancing.   
Combined with all the FOMO investing that seems to be going on, I thought it might be good to discuss actual portfolio management for a bit.   


**Manage risk**  
We all take risks in our investments, but do we manage it as well?   
Risk management is useful not just for safeguarding your investments, but imho above all for your own peace of mind and protection of acting emotionally when things are not going the way you envisioned. It aids you in staying calm and rational  


**Asset Allocation**  
Asset Allocation is one way of managing risk. Even though a lot of coins are correlated with BTC, there is a huge difference in risk between different coins I would say. BTC and ETH probably one of the 'safer' assets, other top 10 coins a bit more riskier and a lot of lesser known coins that are not listed on major exchanges yet as the highest risk.   
By thinking about this and adjusting it a few times, I feel like I don't have to loose sleep over my portfolio AND have fun at the same time. Especially the last part is very important I would say; if you don't allocate some portion to the 'fun, gambling' bit, you probably won't stick to your allocation further down the road. 

I try to have a portfolio that looks roughly like this:  
75% 'safe' - divided in 50% BTC and 25% ETH  
7.5% 'meh risk' - ICX, mostly because it seems less correlated with BTC and earns me a stable 10%  
15% - 'risk' - coins I like because of the projects and that can be considered 'here to stay' . (for me currently VET, ADA, LINK and XLM)  
2.5% 'gamble' - FOMO into whatever i feel like at the time

**Rebalancing**  
This is where it get's interesting and a lot of people miss out imho. By keeping your envisioned Asset Allocation (AA) in check, you automatically sell high and buy low without really timing the market.   
I try to do it on a fixed day every month. (to prevent me to want to time the market).   
I do it by a combination of adjusting my DCA allocation and selling the assets that increased outside of the upper range and buy the assets that went below.   


So let's say VET is mooning c*ompared to the other assets* it would start being more than the allocated 3.75% of my portfolio. And likewise the other assets would have decreased. I then adjust my DCA to buy less of VET this time, to try to rebalance the allocation back to 3.75% . If that's not enough, I'd sell some VET and buy one of the lagging assets.   
If you do this regularly, you can see this automatically let's you sell high and take profits on the price increases and buy in low.

Just got my first lot of coins via Pancake Swap (Safemoon, Charizard, Pig, Pitbull etc)

I will try and keep this objective.

**FACT ONE** 

Currently, there are 10,000 new coins mined _every minute_. This works out to around 14 million new coins every day, 420,000,000 every month and 5.2 billion every year. 

Mining for dogecoin is currently pretty profitable for miners due to the increase in price, which in turn is increasing the amount of miners for doge. 

** FACT TWO ** 

Dogecoin has an unlimited supply. Yes, an unlimited supply. We just learnt that 10,000 coins are mined every minute, but to add to this, dogecoin is a completely inflationary asset. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, for example, where there will only be 21 million bitcoins, ever. 

This can become an issue due to simple supply and demand. Assets that have small supply and high demand will rise in value. The demand for dogecoin is currently rising, hence the increase in price. However as we learnt in fact one, new coins are always being mined and we now know doge has an unlimited supply. 

** FACT THREE** 

12 wallets account for 67% of dogecoin‚Äôs total coins. This means that it is highly centralised and one whale that sells _could_ have a significant impact on the price. This can be found from public data shown [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html)

Over the past 6-8 years we have seen a campaign to demonize not only crypto, but to also limit what people are allowed to say in general. It‚Äôs masked as (oh well that‚Äôs offensive just ban him, oh well that‚Äôs hate speech, oh that just shouldn‚Äôt be said in general.) and yeah while a lot of it is true, it begs the question, the government has never been for the people, so why does it care so much about its minority citizens now? It‚Äôs only logical they will also extend that reach to everything since they know the mass majority will call it science that can‚Äôt be questioned (lol) I‚Äôve had friends of color banned from social media for saying things deemed offensive(that are genuinely mild opinions that don‚Äôt fit with what‚Äôs allowed to be spoken) (at least in the US). They‚Äôre trying to condition people to accept what the government says is okay to talk about as absolute truth and if you question it you‚Äôre also banned from participating in social media with your peers. no questions asked.  which is sickening imo, there should be discussions where people are allowed to learn from their views while discussing with people who don‚Äôt share the same view.

I love the crypto community, but way back in 2012-2013 when I got into bitcoin and viewed it as the currency that would change the system, I honestly had no idea how many people in crypto would still root for/believe the government on any stance they took. Not going to say that‚Äôs what crypto is, but that is how we viewed it 8-9 years ago. A system of banking that big brother does not have his hands on.

I‚Äôm not someone to take advice from, but I will say crypto has turned out to be 100x what I thought when I advocated for it early/mid 10‚Äôs. And seeing the highs and the lows this year are laughable since it really does not represent what crypto is and what it is going to be. (especially with celebs and billionaires having such a say in price which is also disappointing).

Brother man you need to learn to purchase/make crypto in a way not tied to any institutions. They‚Äôve proven they can steer the public‚Äôs opinion on anything with just one major story, and they‚Äôll do the same with crypto. There is a reason why it‚Äôs so hard to obtain XRP now(again at least in the US), which is why it would be worth every penny it is. How the media and big brother steer conversations on a public level is concerning, but a huge bull flag for the crypto industry.

The big players are afraid, and they‚Äôre afraid because they know crypto can not only topple their system, but do it dozens of times better and change the world forever to where the extremely poor won‚Äôt be stuck in a constant loop of debt never allowing them to escape.

/endrant but man crypto is fucking awesome and is absolutely the future of currency. Just look at how it is talked about by major institutions simultaneously while they buy in. They don‚Äôt want to be the last in for an inevitable, and god bless you all for knowing there is a better way to do this all. The world is the world but in 5 years we will no longer recognize it due to mass adoption of a technology that will allow anybody to participate and stay alive. 

TLDR; 
Govt sucks, as an early adopter of crypto it‚Äôs disheartening to see everyone willing to say the government sucks while simultaneously accepting what the government says as absolute truth. Big brother is no ones friend, and as they create more and more ‚Äúcommon sense rules‚Äù that most accept and shame others for not, rules you do not agree with will be introduced. You will be the one saying ‚Äúwait a second, the government shouldn‚Äôt have this power‚Äù while they trample on your rights daily and most citizens cheer it on.",CryptoCurrency,"As an old head, why crypto will always be bullish and what I see as a problem in the crypto community regarding trust in big brother"

1624950132,4,1,"Here is my thought on how we can have a 1000% return on Bitcoin.

To counter the continual money printing, we need to buy quality assets which one of them is digital gold, Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21 million units.

When comparing Bitcoin to gold, there are several big advantages. 

1. Bitcoin is a digital asset and gold is physical. Meaning it is very easy to store Bitcoin, you can just download an app and store it.

2. Second, it is easy to transfer to someone else. You can use the app to do that.

3. Bitcoin can be used in a cross-border payment, you can send it to people from other countries and avoid high remittance fees without the need of a third party.

The current total market cap of gold and bitcoin are around USD 12 trillion and 0.73 trillion respectively. Both of their supplies are fixed. It is not surprising to see the total market cap of Bitcoin can catch up with gold in the long run as Bitcoin has the advantages mentioned above. If we give Bitcoin a long-term market cap of USD 12 trillion and divided by 21 million units, the long-term target price can achieve around USD 570,000, implying a 1,652% potential return from the current price of 34,500 in June 2021.

For being conservative and simple, I think it is reasonable we can at least get a 1,000% return on Bitcoin in the long run. If 1,000% return from now on, my target price is USD 345,000. Of course, I emphasize it is a long-term investment (at least 3-5 years), not a short-term price target. Short-term price movement is affected by too many unpredictable factors which frankly I admit I cannot predict them in advance. Long-term price movement is affected by its fundamentals mainly, just like stocks. Here is my thought, what are yours?

For more details, I have made a 6-minute youtube video at [https://youtu.be/jtY\_w1trAp4](https://youtu.be/jtY_w1trAp4) to talk more about Bitcoin. If you are interested, please feel free to watch and leave any comments.",CryptoCurrency,"My thought on Bitcoin, why 1000% return in the long term"

1625723643,1,1,"This post briefly covers the different consensus mechanisms that form the backbone of the underlying Blockchain technology.   


* Proof of Work   

* Proof of Stake   

* Proof of History   


These are consensus mechanisms that validate the transactions on the Blockchain. Each of these mechanisms work differently. These differences result in different transaction speed, fees and efficiency.   


In order to discuss these 3 mechanisms, we have used three different cryptocurrencies corresponding to the mechanism they follow.   


* **Bitcoin ‚Üí Proof of Work**   

* **Cardano ‚Üí Proof of Stake**   

* **Solana ‚Üí Proof of History**

**Proof of work:**   


**Transactions need to be verified on the network and this verification is done via solving complex mathematical problems, called cryptography. The digital currencies therefore came to be known as ‚ÄòCryptocurrencies.‚Äô It was described in the original whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto,**   


**Verifiers, also known as miners are rewarded for participating and validating the network transactions. This was considered a game-changer when it emerged in the original whitepaper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea existed earlier than the publication in the white paper and was known as the Nakamoto consensus.**   


**According to Satoshi Nakomoto, ‚Äúthe longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of**  CPU **power.‚Äù**   


https://preview.redd.it/t7q2cdlihx971.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b2ec596f30a1e98eccd3eb9fc6f63a2cc5baf45

**However, there are several drawbacks to this mechanism. It uses huge amounts of electricity, and emits significantly large amounts of carbon into the environment. Another major drawback is that transactions are slow and inefficient on a large scale. It limits the scalability of the Proof of Work mechanism to mainstream finance.**   


**Proof of Stake:**   


**It came into existence in 2012 after its founders pointed out the inefficiencies of the Proof of work mechanism.**    


**In blockchains that use proof-of-stake, nodes in the network engage in validating blocks, rather than allocating their computing resources to ‚Äúmine‚Äù them. Within these networks, security and consensus is achieved by participants committing a stake ‚Äî their private or collective capital ‚Äî to the enterprise in the form of the network‚Äôs native tokens.**   


**Ether (ETH) has been indicating to move away from the energy draining proof-of-work mechanism to the energy efficient proof-of-stake for quite some time.**   


**Proof of history:**   
**Proof of History is a sequence of computation that can provide a way to cryptographically verify passage of time between two events.**    


**As per official newsletter of Solana Labs, ‚Äúthe Proof of History solution was presented by the Solana project in order to finally eliminate an issue of the validity of timestamps in distributed networks. Unlike using the established method with timestamps, one can make certain that the action is performed at a distinct point in time after one action, but before another. Through Proof of History, we can ensure that a certain action took place at a certain point in time, before or after another action. This is made possible without the use of timestamps or external synchronizing structures. Confirmation of history is a high-frequency verifiable delay function.**    


**This means that the function requires a sequence of steps in order to obtain and evaluate the uniqueness and reliability of the published value. Solana‚Äôs implementation executes the function that uses a sequential hash system that is resistant to pre-images (images of previously prepared hashes). Thus, the output of the transaction appears as the input of the subsequent transaction. Subsequently, the current counter, status, and output are periodically recorded. The clear advantages are scalability and the eradication of the timestamps validity problem. At the moment, it is rather difficult to single out the obvious shortcomings of the protocol due to the novelty of this solution.‚Äù**   


**Please note: This post is not a recommendation to buy/sell any particular crypto. The technology surrounding each of the above three cryptos are different. There is continuous advancement happening in this space. Interesting things are continuously happening in the crypto space.**",CryptoCurrency,Deep dive: Proof of Work v/s Proof of Stake v/s Proof of History

Hi

I entered crypto this year during May - April, around the time the majority of coins were at there ATH's. Everyday I wake up and check my portfolio and see red everywhere. But that's fine. My goal was never quick to have a quick peep into crypto then pop out as soon as I hit a 10% profit. My goal is to hodl for 5 or so years and take profits in each bull cycle.

I want my family and my future kids to never have to worry about financial troubles, I want my family to be taken care off and that isn't gonna happen by panicking and caring about the downward trend. I want to enjoy life and not be worried that I can't do something because I don't have enough money.

Not long ago I got some VET stolen from me and a certain reddit user (unsure if I can say there name) gifted me the equivalent in moons to make up for the damage. This is honestly the most generous thing a person has ever done for me and I will never forget this person's kind heart!

Stay strong my little diamond hand newbies! We are in this for the long haul and don't forget that!

1626935247,2,1," **The European Commission has proposed a ban on anonymous crypto wallets at financial service providers such as exchanges. The committee is doing this as part of a plan to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.**

[The European Commission this week presented a package with four legislative proposals](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_3690)to combat financial crime. The EU wants, among other things, a ban on cash transactions of more than 10,000 euros within the member states, and writes that European anti-money laundering rules must also apply to cryptocurrencies in the future. This would, among other things, prohibit 'offering anonymous crypto wallets'.

In practice, this will mean, for example, that crypto exchanges will no longer be allowed to offer anonymous crypto wallets to their users, just as anonymous bank accounts are already banned in the European Union. The European Commission also wants to achieve that crypto transactions become traceable, just like regular bank transactions. Crypto payment services, such as exchanges, should, for example, record the name, address and date of birth of the payer and the name and account number of the recipient in transactions, according to the proposed legislation. To implement the plans, the EU wants, among other things, to set up a new European anti-money laundering authority, which will coordinate national financial authorities to ensure that the rules are followed.

This proposed EU body should also improve cooperation between financial intelligence services. The bills have not yet been approved and will not come into effect for the time being. The European Commission package has yet to be assessed by the European Parliament and the European Council, a process that could take a long time. The European Commission hopes that the Anti-Money Laundering Authority will be operational by 2024.

**To be clear: This does not affect your anonymous wallet.** **It's just that exchanges (or banks) are not going to be allowed to offer anonymous wallets. The wallet you create using Metamask or other apps are still going to be allowed. (how else could they?)**",CryptoCurrency,Europe is proposing a ban on anonumous wallets by Echanges / Banks

Though for me personally it‚Äôs tough because I don‚Äôt have technical background and on the internet there‚Äôs too much info making it time-consuming and difficult to sift up the quality information. Really thanks to the Redditors!

If it wasn‚Äôt for these weeks in March to see how exponentially everything was going up, most probably I wouldn‚Äôt have shown interest in crypto and I wouldn‚Äôt start learning and understanding the technology behind.

Summary: I started with small amount of money, which if I lose, I don‚Äôt care. Otherwise I would have spent those money for stupid things (fun money stash). I prefer the DCA. I know that I won‚Äôt be a millionaire with 500$ and for 3 months. Usually I don‚Äôt monitor the price daily, to be honest I don‚Äôt care about the price. It‚Äôs a matter of time the technology to develop even further and the adoption rate to increase, which simultaneously will drive the price. Don‚Äôt forget the more complex a product is the longer the adoption process takes!

I keep reading, watching podcast and educating myself. I must go a long way to be confident in my knowledge.

Thanks for reading! I will appreciate if you share good sources or folks to follow!",CryptoCurrency,Bought in March! Now What?

1627369703,6,1,"You see it posted here often. Dollar cost average is the method of simply putting in an amount of cash regularly into an asset, in our case the asset is cryptocurrency. So I thought it would be useful to show why this is a good method of investing and actually the best method of you have bad timing (which is most of us). The website I‚Äôve used is https://www.costavg.com/ which you can play around with for your own interest to see how much you could have made. 

If you had invested in Bitcoin at the absolute peak of the 2017 (late December) and had the stubbornness to continue to invest through to now you would be up about 327%. So for example if you put $10 per week your total investment would have been $1880 and your current portfolio would be worth $8597. If you had yolo‚Äôd the same amount of $1880 you would still be up but would have a $4180 portfolio.

If you had used the same DCA for ETH your $1880 initial investment would be worth $15392 right now, or if you went for the lump sum tactic would see it worth $5086.

So the moral of the story is if you are bad at timing DCA is the way. If you buy bulk at the bottom you stand to make the most money, however if you‚Äôre not overly greedy the above returns are pretty good.",CryptoCurrency,DCA vs lump sum if you started at the top of the 2017 peak

1627368855,22,1,"To me, it appears cryptocurrencys can be used as a form of communications network. Let's go over how that would work in practice.

Let's say Sally wants to send a message to Bob. Now, Sally could write a letter, and get a stamp, and take the letter to the post office or plop it in her mail box, and send it from there, then it would take X days to arrive.

Lets look at some of the advantages of this method:
Tried and true.
Relatively trust worthy handlers. (At least, if you trust Governments.)
Relatively simple if you have the supplies. (Stamps, Paper, Envelopes)

Now lets look at some of the disadvantages:
Centralized
Prone to human error in delivery
Expensive (US forever stamps currently cost 0.55 USD, increasing to 0.58 USD.)
Unverifiable origin and delivery. (Unless certified. An extra fee.)

Where and how does Cryptocurrency come into play? Well... cryptocurrency replaces the whole model. Instead of stamps, envelopes, and paper, Sally obtains coins that Bob has a wallet for. Sally and Bob agree ahead of time that a transfer of X coins to Y address from Z address means Q. Then, when Y receives X coins from Z, they key holder of Y knows that Z is saying Q. They could even go as far as defining the fact that a transaction has to occur in a certain block to mean Q, otherwise it means D.

Let's look at some of the advantages of this method:
Decentralized
Inexpensive (Depending on chain used)
Independently verifiable delivery.

And some disadvantages:
Public (Depending on chain used)
Steep learning curve
So many god damn chains to choose from

It's also possible that the wallet used by Bob is a burner wallet, generated only to receive that single message, then never touched again. This would require merely generating the wallets private key/an address, sharing the address with Sally, then monitoring the address for the appropriate transfer. No need for seed phrase storage, private key storage, etc. (Only if you're willing to burn funds, but hey, if it costs less than a stamp, you're winning)

A confirmation of receipt can also be implemented by sending the coins back to Sally. This would confirm that the message was received, and Sally would have paid around (NETWORK_FEE x 2). One fee for the send, one fee for the receive.

I believe this is a very expandable use of cryptocurrency. The amount of messages that can be given a value on a coin with 8 decimals is immense. 0.06 coins could mean ""A-Okay"" while 0.16 could mean ""Shit's hit the fan."" And 0.061 could mean ""10-4."" So on and so forth.

Here is a small list of popular exchanges.  It's by no means comprehensive - there are literally hundreds of crypto exchanges, all serving different markets. Nor is it ranked in any way that represents a value judgment.  

Before we soldier on, let's have a quick recap of what an exchange actually *is*. They‚Äôre platforms (web sites and, usually, mobile apps) that let users buy and/or sell cryptocurrency, either through trading for other digital currencies or using traditional fiat assets. Some exchanges accept deposits via credit card, bank account, or wire transfer, while others trade in crypto only. Some offer withdrawals to your own wallets, while others do not, and have varying arrays of coins, fees, and apps. 

With all that said, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the biggest names. 

# Coinbase

https://preview.redd.it/c21u5wlzn3e71.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56ba92bd2081165f2157081c02fbf70f1ea8a368

One of the most well-known and widely used exchanges in the world, [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com/) was founded in 2012 and reached record highs at the end of 2020, with $89B in trading volume. Because it lets users purchase popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum with fiat, Coinbase is often the starting point for most people on their crypto journey. It is currently the only publicly listed crypto exchange.

**What coins can I buy on Coinbase?**

Coinbase has a total of [75 cryptocurrencies](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/supported-crypto.html) available across its regular and Pro exchange. Coinbase has been known for having a strict mechanism to decide what to list and usually Coinbase listing meant well for the coin and its price, although recently this trend has started to change after Coinbase started listing meme coins. 

Coinbase is safe and good for a new investor, however if you are Alt enthusiast, your choices will be very limited.

**What are the fees like?**

You can check out a full rundown of Coinbase and Coinbase Pro fees [here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees) and [here](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/trading-and-funding/trading-rules-and-fees/fees), but here‚Äôs a summary of the fees in general. Coinbase charges a spread of around 0.50% for crypto purchases and sales. In general, the fees on regular Coinbase are regarded to be pretty high, which is the trade-off for beginners finding an easy on-ramp into the crypto world. Coinbase Pro on the other hand has much lesser fees.

**How easy is it to use?**

The regular flavor of Coinbase is one of the easiest ways for anyone to buy crypto, as it supports fiat purchases using your bank or card details. [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) is slightly more complex in that you have to create sell/buy orders, but that‚Äôs bread and butter stuff for any exchange, and is one of the first things that neophyte traders learn. The fact that you can transfer assets from Coinbase to your Coinbase Pro account is another handy bonus.

**Does it have an app?**

Coinbase actually has three different apps, with different functions and target users in mind. Coinbase (for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-sell-bitcoin/id886427730) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.android)) lets you buy crypto with fiat, while storing them in an in-built wallet. Coinbase Pro, also available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-pro/id1446636681) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinbase.pro&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US), unlocks the more advanced trading options with buy/sell orders. Coinbase Wallet (available on, you guessed it, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/coinbase-wallet/id1278383455?ls=1&amp;mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.toshi)) is a third app that actually lets you possess your own coins, using your own private key. This is far better than storing your coins on an exchange wallet, and is always recommended.

## Kraken

https://preview.redd.it/hhepuahqo3e71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=831f91c00db5fa3046f5d827f70f2428b50958f2

Launched in 2013, Kraken is now one of the largest exchanges in the world‚Äîthe fourth-largest in fact. Available in 48 US states and 176 countries, it was founded by crypto enthusiast Jesse Powell, who was prompted to create his own exchange after the infamous Mt. Gox security breach. They plan to go public in 2022.

Personal Experience: Kraken has THE BEST Customer Support ever!

**What coins can I buy on Kraken?**

Kraken currently sells [77 cryptocurrencies](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000678446-Cryptocurrencies-available-on-Kraken), including BTC, DAI, AAVE, ETH, DASH, and etc. It has more Alt options than Coinbase but still lacks many. Notable coins that are missing from the exchange include Binance's BNB and VeChain (VET).

**What are the fees like?**

Kraken charges fees for a number of different things. Here‚Äôs a general overview:

* **Funding fees:** There are fees in place for when you make deposits and withdrawals with both crypto and fiat. These range from 0.9% for stablecoins purchased using fiat or other stablecoins, to 1.5% for other crypto and FX pairs. There are also fees for payment card processing (3.75% + ‚Ç¨0.25) along with an online banking processing fee of 0.5%.¬†
* **Trading fees:** There are also the usual trading fees, which kick in when your order is executed (canceled orders have no fees). Fees range from 0-0.20% of the total value of your order and depend on the currency pair being traded, your 30-day trading volume in USD, and whether your order is maker or taker. There‚Äôs also a minimum trade fee.

Kraken‚Äôs full set of fees can be found [here](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/features/fee-schedule).

**How easy is it to use?**

Kraken‚Äôs super-clean interface and layout make it one of the best-looking exchanges around. Beginners should find it less overwhelming than other offerings, with fewer charts, graphs and buttons cramming the screen. As with most other exchanges, you‚Äôll need to provide some information and official ID if you want to do anything more than the most basic trades, but once you‚Äôve passed KYC checks, everything is clearly laid out and explained.

**Does it have an app?**

Kraken offers [iOS](https://www.kraken.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkraken.app.link%2Fmobile-app-ios) and [Android](https://www.kraken.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkraken.app.link%2Fmobile-apps-android) apps which provide users with a finger-friendly mobile version of the exchange. Having said that, the app isn‚Äôt available in certain countries, including the US.

## Gemini

https://preview.redd.it/q84eomy7p3e71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=965819ae8876287ca63320fe80ef1aaa5cbe4fe6

[Gemini](https://gemini.com/) is another US-based crypto exchange. Headquartered in New York City, it was founded in 2014 by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. In 2016 it became the world‚Äôs first licensed ETH exchange. It prides itself on its security measures, which include private keys, password protection, and storing only a small percentage of the exchange‚Äôs Bitcoin supply online, to reduce the risk of losses through hacking. 

**What coins can I buy on Gemini?**

Gemini has a total of 68 coins available to trade at the time of writing. These include heavy hitters like BTC and ETH, as well as DAI, BAT, AAVE, [Cardano](https://decrypt.co/resources/cardano) (ADA), [Uniswap](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-uniswap) (UNI), [Litecoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/litecoin) (LTC) and more. Though some notable coins are missing from the list, notably Monero, VeChain and (yet again) BNB.

**What are the fees like?**

Like other exchanges, Gemini funds itself through charging fees. It‚Äôs beyond the scope of this article to dive into the fine details (you can view those [here](https://www.gemini.com/fees)), but here‚Äôs a general overview:

* **Trader fees:** The more you trade, the [lower the fees](https://www.gemini.com/fees/activetrader-fee-schedule#section-active-trader-fee-schedule). All orders placed via the mobile app also have a varying [convenience fee](https://www.gemini.com/fees/mobile-fee-schedule), and the same goes for [desktop browsers](https://www.gemini.com/fees/web-fee-schedule) too.
* **Custody fees:** Gemini charges an [annual fee](https://www.gemini.com/fees/custody-fee-schedule#section-notice-of-changes) for storing your digital assets which, at the time of writing, is 0.4%.

**How easy is it to use?**

Gemini is a clean-looking exchange, which makes navigation and use easy for beginners and pros alike. The signup process is relatively straightforward, and you‚Äôll need to supply personal information like your name, address, email and more. You‚Äôll also need to complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. Unlike other exchanges which accept things like driving licenses, Gemini will only accept valid passports. Proof of address requirements are less strict, and can include things like bills and bank statements.

**Does it have an app?**

Gemini has an app that puts the features of the exchange in a smartphone-friendly form factor. It‚Äôs available on both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gemini-buy-sell-crypto/id1408914447) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gemini.android.app), and even the [Samsung Galaxy Store](http://apps.samsung.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=com.gemini.android.app) too.

## Binance

https://preview.redd.it/l87ao73np3e71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5ffc01a1995c9b040fcc7500145f1e5c166f5e0

**What is Binance?**

Next to Coinbase, [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) is one of the most recognizable crypto exchanges around, and is the number one exchange in the world in terms of trading volume. Founded in China in 2017 by Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao, the company moved its headquarters and servers from China to Japan ahead of China‚Äôs ban on crypto trading in 2017. Over the years its headquarters have moved, and it was, until early 2020, located in Malta. While it has lots of offices with staff in over 50 countries, its officially registered headquarters is now in the Cayman Islands.

**What coins can I buy on Binance?**

Binance lists hundreds of coins for users to trade, including BTC, ETH and LTC, along with, of course, its own native BNB tokens. The exchange is continuously growing its collection of listed coins too, and is often seen as the holy grail of exchanges for coins to get listed on, especially by enthusiastic coin communities. 

That's perhaps no surprise; Binance is adept at rapidly responding to emerging trends in crypto, and quickly listing the latest hot coin; one reason why its list of supported coins is so comprehensive.

**What are the fees like?**

Binance‚Äôs [fees](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/115000429332) are some of the lowest in the industry, made possible, no doubt, by the fact that it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest exchange.¬†

* **Trading fees:** There are various trading fees, depending on what your use case is. Each trade carries a standard 0.1% fee if you don‚Äôt use BNB to pay your trading fees. Binance also uses a maker-taker structure, and offers different ways to lower the fees. You can, for example, buy Binance‚Äôs own BNB tokens to pay fees with a 35% discount. You can also refer friends to the exchange to snap up more discounts, and high-volume traders can level their account up for some VIP discounts too.

**How easy is it to use?**

The sheer size of Binance‚Äôs coin and trade offerings can be overwhelming for beginners. There‚Äôs a hell of a lot to take in, and it can be a bit confusing. Once you understand the basic concept of sell and buy orders though, it‚Äôs easy to use, though not quite as accessible as the regular version of Coinbase (which isn‚Äôt really a fully-fledged exchange anyway). Binance Academy is a useful resource for newbies to learn about crypto in general, as well as offering in-depth guides to all the trading options that Binance has to offer.

In 2021, regulators around the world turned their attention to Binance; the UK's [FCA](https://decrypt.co/74658/uk-fca-reveals-its-huge-issue-with-binance-no-hq-and-aml-approach) issued a warning that the exchange was not permitted to undertake ""regulated activity"" in the country, while Japan's [FSA](https://decrypt.co/74521/japans-finance-regulator-warns-binance-is-operating-without-registration) warned that Binance was operating without registering with the regulator. Italy's [securities regulator](https://decrypt.co/75984/italian-securities-regulator-binance-not-authorized-provide-investment-services) also warned that Binance is ""not authorized to provide investment services and activities in Italy.""

While none of these actions amounts to a [ban](https://decrypt.co/74608/binance-not-permitted-to-operate-in-the-uk-british-financial-watchdog) on trading using Binance, several payment channels to and from the exchange have been disrupted. Practically, that means it's now difficult for many people to use Binance as a one-stop shop for buying, selling and trading crypto; instead they're forced to use the exchange purely for trading, making use of other channels to actually purchase or sell crypto with fiat currency.employ

**Does it have an app?**

Binance has both an [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/hk/app/binance/id1436799971?l=en) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.binance.dev) app, both of which bring the functionality of the desktop site to your pocket. The app is highly rated across both platforms‚Äîjust make sure you‚Äôre downloading the official one and not a dodgy copy, especially if you‚Äôre an Android user.

## FTX

https://preview.redd.it/twle298zp3e71.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5469c26b8d5cb3ab3319b73c107981bb78d2834f

Launched in May 2019, [FTX](https://ftx.com/) is a relatively new entry, and is one of the top crypto derivatives exchanges in the world. This means it‚Äôs different from your traditional exchange in the sense that users can trade contracts on crypto assets, or buy tokens representing other assets or funds. One example are futures‚Äîinvestments which provide users with an obligation to buy or sell assets at an agreed future date.

**What coins can I buy on FTX?**

While FTX is primarily a derivatives exchange, it still offers a spot market (more traditional buying and selling orders). It currently offers just over 100 coins including BTC, BNB, UNI, ETH, BAT, and DOGE, with trading pairs including BTC, USDT, and AUD, EUR and USD. Exceptions on the spot trading market include XMR and VET, although they are supported in the futures market. In July 2021, FTX announced that it would limit users to a [maximum leverage of 20x](https://decrypt.co/76858/ftx-and-binance-remove-high-leverage-from-exchanges).

**What are the fees like?**

FTX has a tier-based [fee structure](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024479432-Fees) that‚Äôs based on trading volumes in USD.¬†

* **Trading fees:** Most users will have maker fees of 0.02%, with taker fees at 0.07%. Higher volume traders will see these fees reduce. Other fees can also be found with leveraged tokens and redemption fees which are 0.01%, while users trading with a 50x or 100x leverage on futures contracts will see increased trading fees of 0.02% and 0.03%.

**How easy is it to use?**

FTX is a slick, polished exchange, but there are no two ways about it‚Äîif you‚Äôre a beginner then the options of futures, stocks, leveraged tokens, volatility and more will make for a very confusing and intimidating first impression. That‚Äôs not a knock against the exchange itself, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs aimed at experienced crypto users looking for something beyond simple trading.

**Does it have an app?**

The FTX app is available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ftx-pro/id1512374471) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ftxmobile.ftx), and offers a similarly smooth experience to the full-fat desktop website.

**What is Crypto.com?**

Founded in 2016, [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) was previously known as Monaco, but was rebranded one year later after the (expensive) acquisition of the crypto.com domain. While it‚Äôs best known for its Visa card, which allows users to convert their cryptocurrency and spend it anywhere that Visa is accepted, it also has other features‚Äîincluding an exchange.

**What coins can I buy on Crypto.com?**

Crypto.com has over [120 coins and tokens](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/1342333-which-crypto-can-i-buy-in-the-crypto-com-app) available to trade at the time of writing against USDT and the exchange‚Äôs own native token, CRO. BTC-tradable pairs are reduced to around 26 coins.

Exceptions include XMR, and while BNB is supported in some states, it‚Äôs not available in Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Vermont, Washington, Georgia, and Oregon.

**What are the fees like?**

As with a number of other exchanges, Crypto.com‚Äôs [fees ](https://crypto.com/exchange/document/fees-limits)are volume-based, which means they decrease as your trading volume increases.¬†

* **Trading fees:** The highest fees are 0.10% for makers and 0.16% for takers. These drop all the way down to 0.04% and 0.10% respectively, although your trading volume will have to reach the lofty levels of $200,000,001 within a 30-day window. You can also choose to stake CRO and pay your trading fees in CRO, which nets you an additional 10% fee discount across all tiers.

**How easy is it to use?**

The main exchange is easy to use for anyone who‚Äôs got to grips with basic trading options. The interface is clean and minimal, and should be easy to pick up. Things get more complicated if you click around and find the likes of derivatives trading of course, but that‚Äôs purely due to the experience required to find yourself at home there.

**Does it have an app?**

Crypto.com has apps on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crypto-com-buy-bitcoin-now/id1262148500) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mona.android) which makes for a handy way to keep on top of trading, while also checking your Crypto.com card information, if you decide to sign up for one. If you do, you can get up to 8% cashback as well as earning interest on your crypto assets.",CryptoCurrency,The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Exchanges

I see this is a recurrent question on this sub, some people say because Bitcoin is King and everything else follows it, which is true but not really explanatory.

The fundamental reason behind altcoins following Bitcoin is because altcoin prices are typically **measured** in Bitcoin, their trading pairs are done with Bitcoin so, in other words, their value is calculated in Bitcoin, and if its value goes down, it tanks the altcoins aswell since they are literally measured in BTC.

The proposal is alarming many in the industry, who are concerned about new rules they could be stuck with for years.

Lawmakers have debated language that would expand the definition of broker to include decentralized exchanges and peer-to-peer transactions. The proposal is headed for a quick vote in the Senate.

For the hardfork itself, we have two scenarios:

No new token is created with ETH becoming a cross-chain token to be used between the two chains, working together.

**Scenario B:**

The chain splits into two competing chains and a new token is created. 

&amp;#x200B;

Under scenario A, moons will be governed by the gas fees of the appropriate chain and transaction cost be paid in ETH, just like before. 

Under scenario B is when it gets a little complicated. If a new token is created, Moons now have to consider how each mainnet deals with its fees as well as what makes the most sense for Moons.

&amp;#x200B;

In either case, there are some challenging decisions ahead following the fork.

1628402612,65,1,"The ""flippening"", traditionally, refers to the point at which ETH's market cap overtakes BTC's. This can also be thought of as the moment ETH becomes the dominant factor in the market.

Recently, ETH's dominance has been growing:

https://preview.redd.it/sxgs359ui2g71.png?width=1883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=180090c2a6023ddad42099553664b4065d3910aa

But the gap remains large. As it stands ETH would need to rise to $7.1k to match BTC's market cap of 831.38b (with no change in BTC's price) and ETH has not yet recaptured its ATH dominance (25.59 - July 17') - but it's certainly readying itself to challenge BTC again.

Nevertheless, market cap/dominance is not the only metric. ETH has already flipped BTC in many ways:

|*Metrics*|*Ethereum*|*Bitcoin*|*Flippening %*|*ATH*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Google Trends**|34.4|102.5|33.5%|97.5% (May 21')|

i.e.: ETH is currently the most **used** cryptocurrency. Unsurprising - since ETH and BTC, currently, serve vastly different purposes. Although, IMO, ETH is or will also be an effective store of value.

1628837885,84,1,"As the title suggests, crypto hasn't been around long enough for us to witness a major crash such that we're able to develop some historical correlation between them and equities. Personally, I believe the answer is unfortunately yes because a stock market crash would cause the destruction of two things, liquidity and investor confidence.

Both of these things are critical and required in high supply for the cryptomarket to rally or even sustain prices. As the stock market crashes though, investor liquidity is destroyed and will dissapear into a quite literal void - individuals as well as institutions will be forced to liquidate their assets in order to cover their asses to meet margin calls or investor fund withdrawals. I believe they'll source this liquidity from their crypto portfolio.

In terms of investor confidence, this variable will be just as important if not even more than liquidity. Crypto is still seen as a new asset class to old-school dinosaur investors and would not likely be seen as a 'safe haven of value' during a crash. Therefore, the  first thing to go in their portfolios would be what they believe to be speculative assets - as they try to secure more material assets such as gold.

Obviously this hypothesis relies on the assumption that stock market investors are also deeply invested in the crypto market - while it seems that the crypto market has a base of its own composed of people completely new to the idea of investing.

Blockchain for gaming has long been thought of as the perfect combination. After all, blockchain solves many traditional problems of the gaming [industry](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2020/02/how-blockchain-is-making-digital-gaming-better/).  Their growth has attracted the attention of many platforms in this space, with a number of games being launched every day.  
Here are some of the most exciting and popular projects this year:

1) [Farsite](https://farsite.online/): This is a space-themed MMORTS (Massively Multiplayer Online Real-time Strategy) game on Polygon, developed by the makers of the popular game MegaCryptoPolis. This game consists of a decentralized universe with player-owned economics based on NFTs designed for Eth2.  


2) [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/): This is a Pokemon-inspired universe where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can battle, collect, raise, and build a land-based kingdom for their pets.  
Yes, I know Axie is really hyped and expensive to get into, but it doesn't take away the fact that's it's the most popular blockchain game presently.  


3) [VulcanVerse](https://vv.vulcanforged.com/): VulcanVerse is the flagship game of Vulcan Forged.  
The Vulcan Forged ecosystem is already an established blockchain and NFT game studio, marketplace, and dApp incubator with 10+ games, a solid community, and a top 5 marketplace volume.  
This MMORPG is a fantasy virtual world made up of unique pieces of land using blockchain technology. Users can explore, build, play, buy, sell and interact. The beta version of this game is up and running.  


4) [Taurion](https://taurion.io/): This is another space-themed MMORTS built on the XAYA blockchain. They have a solid partnership with Ubisoft Entrepreneurs lab. This game is a fully player-driven economy that allows players to mine, refine, research, kill, ally, steal, and so much more.  


5) [Hash Rush](https://hashrush.com/): This is an online Sci-Fi/Fantasy RTS game that is set in a distant galaxy. The objective is to build colonies and mine 'Crypto Crystals.' This game is built on the Ethereum blockchain and does not require any crypto or wallet to play the game.

# Peer to Peer!

90,2% got it right! Congratulations! and also congratulations to the ones who fail but learnt something!

**Definition of P2P:**

Peer To Peer (P2P) computing or networking is a [distributed application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_application) architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client‚Äìserver model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#cite_note-CP2P-2)

While P2P systems had previously been used in many application domains, the architecture was popularized by the file sharing system Napster, originally released in 1999. The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. In such social contexts, peer-to-peer as a meme refers to the egalitarian social networking that has emerged throughout society, enabled by Internet technologies in general.

I have just created a token called Asshole (ASS). This token is designed to have no/low value, and the whole point of it is to have some fun. I do not intend for this to make money, and neither should anyone else who is looking to buy this toke. This token is made for fun, not profits.



This token can be used for many things, however, the following uses were the o that I have intended when creating this token.  
1: Scammers. One of the first uses of this token is for scammers. Is a scammer promising you massive returns on your tokens, or is requiring you to send a token to ""VERIFY"" your address. Send them this token and let them know exactly how you feel about them. They will get the message in the form of a fun token.  
Furthermore, if the scammer is requiring your private keys/seed phrase, fill your wallet up with these tokens and send them the wallet. They will know what you think of them.

2: Annoying friends. Another way that this token could be used for is for your annoying friends. Do you have friends that are constanlty begging you to give them free cryptocurrency. Tell them that you finally changed your mind and send them this token. They will get what they wanted, along with a message about how you feel about them annoying you.

3: Anonymous messaging system. Want to tell your friend that they are an Asshole. Send them this token, and they will know that someone thinks that they are an Asshole, but will not know who.

Now I know that has almost nothing to do with cryptocurrency, but I am sick of working a remote desk job I do not have any passion for. I am heavily experienced in communication and writing skills along with other general transferrable skills/qualities that make me a good fit for many places even outside of my field.

Without realizing, I had developed a large passion for this and am keen to jumping on any opportunities I can in this space.

I've calculated that I can go ""bankrupt"" (broke) 3-5 more times in my life and based on my speed of knowledge and wisdom acquisition, that would be fine. I have zero debt and don't believe in it. I withdraw cash once a week and save smaller notes for laundry day and end of week partying/tips.

I selected 7 projects to invest in, 6 medium-risk and 1 high risk. All of my money is in crypto. 

Before investing, I create a due diligence sheet and try to reach out to someone on the team (devs, CEO, someone with power).

I hold: BTC, ETH, ADA, MATIC, THETA, XLM, and BONFIRE.

I put about 50% of my money each paycheck into those roughly evenly divided. I send it to a trezor that I don't physically have access to (only I have the pin and it's safe).

1629702104,5,1,"It's been a year since I joined the cryptocurrency community. I have been in different forums and Telegram chats, where minute by minute, people talk about cryptocurrencies, discuss news, open debates, presume profits, lament losses and much more. The composition of these groups is remarkably heterogeneous, we can find veterans, millionaires, experts, whales (investors who contribute a huge amount of capital), trolls, curious people, amateurs and novices, each one plays a role within the community. But if I have been able to observe something in some of these communities, and what I want to focus on specifically, is how the learning and socialization process unfolds.

The world of cryptocurrencies is relatively new. Although Bitcoin was born in 2008, the boom for it did not develop until the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, when its value reached $20,000. This record [attracted millions of users around the world](https://trends.google.es/trends/explore?date=2010-01-01%202018-06-01&amp;q=criptomonedas), very different people, from different disciplinary fields (or without belonging to any of them). This news marked a before and after, it brought sociodemographic variety to a community that was homogeneous. It was then that the duality in the community was formed: people with years of experience who know how the blockchain works vs people without any experience who do not know anything about the blockchain. The latter face the process of learning and socialization in the community through the use of multimedia content platforms, chats and forums. They do it by these means because there is feedback and it is immediate. It is faster and more comfortable than opening a book or reading a text with many pages. But what happens?

There are communities that make the learning curve difficult. I have come to see how in some chats, these new inexperienced members are displaced, rejected or discriminated against by the majority of the community due to their novice status. When it comes to asking something technical, graphic or simply the meaning of any slang. Hindering the learning curve of new members of the community is self-injurious for the community: it makes cohesion impossible, makes it difficult to channel information adequately within the group and prevents it from flowing correctly, creating a weak, polarized and unequal community, and even more vulnerable to scams.

It is important to provide information and solutions to new members in the community and to avoid all kinds of discrimination or displacement.

I am looking for talented community builders to partner on a platform (

[https://www.dogeland.exchange](https://www.dogeland.exchange)) I am building.

The vision is a decentralized NFT platform that also brings utilities to Dogecoin. For the long term, I want this platform to be developed and managed by the community for the people. Something that allows people to learn crypto, blockchain and NFT with no cost. Just willingness to learn.

If you are interested, please let me know.

Could you please share with the the following:

1. Your past experience with community building and why are you excited about it?
2. What's your vision for such project?

Thanks,

1630997697,0,1,"If you‚Äôre reading this, you are already participating in the modern web (Web 2.0). The web we experience today is much different than what it was just 10 years ago (Web 1.0). And with Web3, it's getting ready to change again.

In this article, I will lay out how the web has evolved, where's it going next, and why this matters.

If history has taught us anything, these changes will matter a lot. Think about how the internet affects your life on a daily basis. Consider how society has changed as a result of the internet. Social media platforms. Mobile apps. And now the internet is going through another paradigm shift as we speak.

The Evolution of the Web

The web has evolved a lot over the years, and the applications of it today are almost unrecognizable from its most¬†early days. The evolution of the web is often partitioned into three separate stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0.

What is Web 1.0?

Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the web. Most participants were consumers of content, and the creators were typically developers who build websites that contained information served up mainly in text or image format. Web 1.0 lasted approximately from 1991 to 2004.

Web 1.0 consisted of sites serving static content instead of dynamic HTML. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn't have much interactivity at all.

You can think of Web 1.0 as the read-only web.

What is Web 2.0?

Most of us have primarily experienced the web in its current form, commonly referred to as¬†Web2. You can think of Web2 as the interactive and social web.

In the Web2 world, you don‚Äôt have to be a developer to participate in the creation process. Many apps are built in a way that easily allows anyone to be a creator.

If you want to craft a thought and share it with the world, you can. If you want to upload a video and allow millions of people to see it, interact with it, and comment on it, you can do that too.

Web2 is simple, really, and because of its simplicity more and more people around the world are becoming creators.

The web in its current form is really great in many ways, but there are some areas where we can do a lot better.

Web 2.0 Monetization and Security

In the Web2 world, many popular apps are following a common pattern in their life cycles. Think of some of the apps that you use on a daily basis, and how the following examples might apply to them.

Monetization of Apps

Imagine the early days of popular applications like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, or YouTube and how different they are today. The process usually goes something like this:

Company launches an app

It onboards as many users as possible

Then it monetizes its user base

When a developer or company launches a popular app, the user experience is often very slick as the app continues rising in popularity. This is the reason they are able to gain traction quickly in the first place.

At first, many software companies do not worry about monetization. They strictly focus on growth and on locking in new users ‚Äì but eventually they have to start turning a profit.

They also need to consider the role of outside investors. Often the constraints of taking on things like venture capital negatively affect the life cycle, and eventually the user experience, of many applications that we use today.

If a company building an application takes in venture capital, its investors often expect a return on investment in the order of magnitude of tens or hundreds of what they paid in.

This means that, instead of going for some sustainable model of growth that they can sustain in a somewhat organic manner, the company is often pushed towards two paths: advertisements or selling personal data.

For many Web2 companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, more data leads to more personalized ads. This leads to more clicks and ultimately more ad revenue. The exploitation and centralization of user data is core to how the web as we know and use it today is engineered to function.

Security and privacy

Web2 applications repeatedly experience¬†data breaches. There are even¬†websites¬†dedicated to keeping up with these breaches and telling you when your data has been compromised.

In Web2, you don‚Äôt have any control over your data or how it is stored. In fact, companies often track and save user data without their users' consent. All of this data is then owned and controlled by the companies in charge of these platforms.

Users who live in countries where they have to worry about the negative consequences of free speech are also at risk.

Governments will often shut down servers or seize bank accounts if they believe a person is voicing an opinion that goes against their propaganda. With centralized servers, it is easy for governments to intervene, control, or shut down applications as they see fit.

Because banks are also digital and under centralized control, governments often intervene there as well. They can shut down access to bank accounts or limit access to funds during times of volatility, extreme inflation, or other political unrest.

Web3 aims to solve many of these shortcomings by fundamentally rethinking how we architect and interact with applications from the ground up.

What is Web 3.0?

There are a few fundamental differences between Web2 and Web3, but decentralization is at its core.

Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. Web3 is:

Verifiable

Trustless

Self-governing

Permissionless

Stateful

Native built-in payments

In Web3, developers don't build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database (usually hosted on and managed by a single cloud provider).

Instead, Web3 applications either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that forms a¬†cryptoeconomic protocol. These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps), and you will see that term used often in the Web3 space.

To achieve a stable and secure decentralized network, network participants (developers) are incentivized and compete to provide the highest quality services to anyone using the service.

When you hear about Web3, you'll notice that cryptocurrency is often part of the conversation. This is because cryptocurrency plays a big role in many of these protocols. It provides a financial incentive (tokens) for anyone who wants to participate in creating, governing, or improving one of the projects themselves.

These protocols often offer a variety of different services like compute, storage, bandwidth, identity, hosting, and other web services commonly provided by cloud providers in the past.

People can make a living by participating in the protocol in various ways, in both technical and non-technical levels.

Consumers of the service usually pay to use the protocol, similarly to how they would pay a cloud provider like AWS today. Except in Web3, the money goes directly to the network participants.

In this, like in many forms of decentralization, you'll see that unnecessary and often inefficient intermediaries are cut out.

Many web infrastructure protocols like¬†Filecoin,¬†Yearn,¬†Sia, and¬†The Graph¬†(which is what I work with at Edge &amp; Node) have issued utility tokens that govern how the protocol functions. These tokens also reward participants at many levels of the network.

Native payments

Tokens also introduce a native payment layer that is completely borderless and frictionless. Companies like Stripe and Paypal have created billions of dollars of value in enabling electronic payments.

These systems are overly complex and still do not enable true international interoperability between participants. They also require you to hand over your sensitive information and personal data in order to use them.

Crypto¬†wallets¬†like¬†MetaMask¬†and¬†Torus¬†enable you to integrate easy, anonymous, and secure international payments and transactions into Web3 applications.

A new way of building companies

Tokens also brings about the idea of tokenization and the realization of a¬†token economy.

Take, for example, the current state of building a software company. Someone comes up with an idea, but in order to start building they need money in order to support themselves.

To get the money, they take on venture capital and give away a percentage of the company. This investment immediately introduces mis-aligned incentives that will, in the long run, not align well with building out the best user experience.

Also, if the company ever does become successful, it will take a very long time for anyone involved to realize any of the value, often leading to years of work without any real return on investment.

Imagine, instead, that a new and exciting project is announced that solves a real problem. Anyone can participate in building it or investing in it from day one. The company announces the release of x number of tokens, and give 10% to the early builders, put 10% for sale to the public, and set the rest aside for future payment of contributors and funding of the project.

Stakeholders can use their tokens to vote on changes to the future of the project, and the people who helped build the project can sell some of their holdings to make money after the tokens have been released.

People who believe in the project can buy and hold ownership, and people who think the project is headed in the wrong direction can signal this by selling their stake.

Because blockchain data is all completely public and open, purchasers have complete transparency over what is happening. This is in contrast to buying equity in private or centralized businesses where many things are often cloaked in secrecy.

This is already happening in the Web3 space.

One example is the app¬†Radicle¬†(a decentralized GitHub alternative) which allows stakeholders to participate in the¬†governance¬†of their project.¬†Gitcoin¬†is another that allows developers to get paid in cryptocurrency for jumping in and working on Open Source issues. And¬†Yearn¬†allows stakeholders to participate in decision making and voting on proposals.

How Identity Works in Web3

In Web3,¬†Identity¬†also works much differently than what we are used to today. Most of the time in Web3 apps, identities will be tied to the wallet address of the user interacting with the application.

Unlike Web2 authentication methods like OAuth or email + password (that almost always require users to hand over of sensitive and personal information), wallet addresses are completely anonymous unless the user decides to tie their own identity to it publicly.

If the user chooses to use the same wallet across multiple dapps, their identity is also seamlessly transferable across apps, which lets them build up their reputation over time.

How to Build on Web3

I'm a developer who recently transitioned into the Web3 space from a traditional development background. So I wanted to start building to get a sense of what the development experience felt like. And I wanted to get an understanding of the types of apps that we can build today.

I dove right in and decided to document some of the things I was doing in a couple of blog posts. If you are interested in learning more about this space, you can check out these two posts:

1631258602,32,1,"I recently read a post where a person mentioned they're from a developing country and are using crypto for international transactions for their work and saving on fees associated with services like PayPal.

I live in a developing country too and work with international clients. However, unlike the other person, I cannot accept crypto from my clients because there are extremely specific laws regarding foreign exchange and taxation. I am basically forced to use services like PayPal to create a ""proper"" flow of transactions and invoices or the government can take away my business license.

Also if I start to accept crypto, the moment I withdraw them into cash, the entire amount would be considered as income and I cannot deduct business expenses from them at the time of paying taxes. Imagine you charge someone $1000 for a small project and out of that $1000, you spend $600 in expenses. However, in the eyes of the law, you need to declare $1000 as income and pay taxes on it even though you technically only earned $400.

We all like the idea that crypto can lift poverty and help international business but the main problem is traditional laws that are highly biased against crypto. This is why the El Salvador experiment can be a good thing because it paves the way for crypto to be recognized properly and allows legit businesses like me to start accepting them once the business laws catch up.

I also think it is not very secure to store all phrases on a piece of paper at home. Why not storing 12-words decentralized encrypted online and the remaining 12-words on a sheet of paper?

Do you think a decentralized online encryption service for storing 12-words of your 24-word seed phrase would be useful and make your life a easier when handling one or even multiple wallets eg. I have about 10? Assuming that the remaining 12-words of each wallet are privately stored on a sheet of paper and the remaining12-word seed phrase is safe and cannot be hacked via a brute force attack.

I mean you could store 12 words encrypted online and take the other 12 with you, either on paper or remembering them by heart. I personally do not want to store 24 words completly at home on paper. I want something decentralized encrypted online. Maybe a homepage as a gate granting access to a smart contract. Yes... the homepage might get hacked, or your machine has a key logger running. Doesnt matter since the other 12 words are still missing anyway.

The other thing would be using BIP39 and storing all 24-words encrpted online and just remembering the 25th phrase, could be an entire page of a book you like or what ever. Also you would not lose any security or running in danger of losing control over your wallets/private keys if you or the homepage got hacked.

1631257420,11,1,"Some of us know, some of us don't, but making international wire transfers can be an absolute nightmare. I'm an American, but my wife is a citizen of Kyrgyzstan. We live in her country and make our living here because obtaining a US immigration visa is a lengthy process (we've already waited 9 months and are slated for another year of waiting).

Like many developing countries, Kyrgyzstan has a cash-based economy. Thus, we're paid in cash. Well, I got a job offer in a job offer in another country, but because of restrictions, we can only cross international borders with so much cash. Well, my parents happened to be visiting, so they did us a favor and when they went back home, put our money in my US bank account. Suddenly, COVID rears its ugly head and the inviting country, where my new job is, denies us visas because Kyrgyzstan does essentially nothing to prevent the spread of COVID.

Well, damn. We're stuck here. And most of our cash is in my US-based bank. There's no way I'm going to pay outrageous ATM and bank fees to take out a couple hundred dollars at a time. Fine. Let's try an international wire transfer to my wife's bank. We do so. It was free to send it in Kyrgyzstan's national currency. Great! I love free! But it will take 3 business days. Seems ridiculous in the 21st century, but what can you do (I'm getting there, obviously, but I like storytelling)? I send a test transfer in case something goes wrong. Something *always* goes wrong here in Kyrgyzstan. I'm not exaggerating.

Lo, and behold! The money arrives... in euros. My wife's bank refuses to give us the money unless she opens a special account that can receive euros. But it's going to cost us basically the whole transfer. Um, no. Okay, says the bank, we can send it back to the US bank, but it's also going to cost you the whole transfer. What the hell? So I call my bank, ramble on about this whole story I've just now told you, and they tell me to have the other bank send the money back and they'll take care of the fee.

Well, now my wife's bank refuses to send it back and tells me only my bank can request that the money be recalled. Okay, I know they're giving me a hard time, but goddamn, just give me my money back. Call my bank again, they say they'll recall it for me and it won't cost me a thing. Thank you very much. Oh, but it will take 30 to 90 days.

Now you've stuck with me this far and you're probably thinking, ""OP, when the hell are you going to circle-jerk us by saying that cryptocurrency is the answer to all of our problems?"" Well, gather around the fire, my friends. Eventually, in my slowness of mind, I recall the benefits of crypto. So my wife makes an account on a crypto exchange and I send her a small amount of XLM for no fee. It arrives quickly. We convert it to fiat for a 0.1% fee. All we need to do is send it to my wife's bank account, which will be immediate and for a 1% fee. Well, this is so much faster and cheaper! We are definitely accessing our money this way! Well, let's put it in the bank and withdraw it! Oh wait... the fiat is goddamn EUROS because the Kyrgyzstani som is an option nowhere! Guess we'll be opening a euro account at my wife's bank anyways.

P.S. If anyone knows of a cheaper and more efficient way to make the transfer with crypto than we did, please share. Thank you for reading my winding and weaving tapestry of a tale.

tl;dr: international wire transfers suck because they take a long time, can be done incorrectly, and have larger fees. XLM made for a nice medium for a money transfer because it costs much less time and money.

**They will drop tomorrow at 4pm BST/11am EST.**

 

### Fuzzballs

Fuzzballs started  out as a Tumblr webcomic in 2013. Gaining popularity, the Fuzzballs  brand expanded and a merchandise line was launched in 2015. 

Currently, 300 products are available world-wide from which over  35,000 items were sold through the Fuzzballs website and several  retailers including [HMV](https://www.hmv.com/), [EMP ](https://www.emp-online.com/)and [Scribbler](https://www.scribbler.com/).

 Fuzzballs social media stickers have seen a lot of popularity over  time, with Over 700 million social media stickers downloaded for use on  Facebook, Instagram and iOS amongst other platforms. 

Now they launch their NFT line on the Tezos-based NFT platform Kalamint. This allows both NFT collectors and the community of Fuzzballs fans to get their own Fuzzball NFT.

### Fuzzballs On Kalamint

Fuzzballs is currently a retail brand  with a focus on merchandise and it‚Äôs popular animated comics. Now  Fuzzballs will step into the NFT industry and it will do so on  Tezos-based NFT platform Kalamint, bringing a popular retail product to  the digital space..¬†

Several series of the Fuzzball NFT  brand are in development such as Halloween themes, individual character  animations and even a collectible card line. 

The first collection will have a Tezos theme, as they will be  visiting Athens,Babylon, Carthage,Delphi, Edo, Florence &amp; Granada as  a reference to the names of the seven upgrades the Tezos protocol has  had in the past three years.¬†

Price ranges are expected to be affordable although there are also plans for limited editions.¬†

There might also be a line of Fuzzballs NFT‚Äôs that have more functionality than a collectors item:

*We are already talking with our  manufacturers of our physical products and they can‚Äôt wait to jump on  board either with NFTs unlocking exclusive products or gaining NFTs via  product purchases.*

### Kalamint

Fuzzballs will go live on Kalamint  tomorrow at 11:00 am EST. Kalamint is an NFT platform that is built on  Tezos and only allows verified artists to mint and sell NFT‚Äôs on their  platform. 

This way you have a stronger guarantee that whatever you collect on  Kalamint, is a legit NFT and not a copymint of an original artist.¬†

Built on Tezos, Kalamint also ensures  that minting and collecting NFT‚Äôs is done with a minimal impact on the  environment. Minting an NFT on the Tezos blockchain, costs about as much  energy as sending a tweet on Twitter. 

You can read more about this in this article by [TQ Tezos](https://medium.com/tqtezos/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-the-ecological-footprint-c58029faee44%C2%A0).¬†

Minting and collecting on Tezos also  means that transaction costs are low. This means that collecting and  minting NFT‚Äôs is fun and you only have to keep track of the prices of  the NFT‚Äôs you buy, and not of the current transaction costs of the  blockchain. This is a huge improvement compared to the NFT market on  Ethereum.",CryptoCurrency,Fuzzballs (700 million social media stickers downloaded) NFTs Are About To Drop Tomorrow On Tezos-Based NFT Platform Kalamint
1631690173,74,1,"That's the trending post on r/cc today : somehow Solana team was able to shutdown the entire sol network by themselves.

Thousands of upvotes later, probably half or reddit is picturing Solana boss in his office, with a big red button on his desk, sweating while shutting down all operations on the Blockchain.

Well, that's stupid, and that's not how it works. Not a all.

First, let's start with the beginning. Sol network was under attack. A big, coordinated attack, before bugging the network was processing 400,000 tps. ETH can process 30tps, to give you an idea, even if it's not 1:1 comparable.
That will give you an idea of Sol efficiency.

Then at around 400ktps, node began to bug and fork themselves. Node owners decided to stop their nodes, not Solana team. 

There is no magic switch on Sol office that can shut down the nodes, no backdoor hidden on the code to take full power over the nodes
(You can of course check, because code is open and available for everyone to check.)

It was a distributed decision, and for the good. And now less than 24h after the attack, nodes are back up, with a patch already in place, released by the Sol team.

So we have a chain than can process more transaction in a single second that ETH in a full year, under a massive attack (üòç) from an unknown origin (but certainly not a small hacker in his bedroom), that suffer virtually no damage (nobody lost any fund here) and that released a patch in less than 24h.
And on top of it, it's still on Beta. 
Pretty bullish if you ask me!

But FUD is done now, most of Reddit sold its Sol. Litteraly days after complaining about the LTC/Walmart sub.
I swear sometimes I think this sub is getting more and more stupid.",CryptoCurrency,"No, the Solana team can't shut sol chain by themselves..."

1631949064,36,1,"The  core aim of regulation is to know the flow of money - who is sending the money and who is receiving. This is beneficial for society and  governance in many ways. Current methods of regulations have been tuned and perfected over centuries of financial transactions. Although it is  well-intentioned, directly translating this old system ignores the innovation and novelty of the blockchain technology. For example, getting the KYC for every individual behind every transaction will severely limit the power of the technology.

Fair regulations on any technology's usage requires fair understanding of the technology. This is either absent or extremely poor in traditional financial circles and among most law-makers. It is a myth that blockchain transactions are untraceable. In fact, it offers more transparency and can be traced much better than any government issued  currency (e.g., cash transactions).

I  do not know what the exact form of regulation should be, but it has to  be some automated monitoring of transactions to spot misconduct. Or maybe, cooperating with the industry itself. Or maybe registering on an international database of wallets (like internet domains) -- as of yet, the best policy is not clear.

But far away from the top 10, altcoins have also proven to be gold mines in the past month that almost no one has on their radar.

 **1st place: eCash (XEC)** 

The first place is secured by eCash (XEC). On August 16, one XEC still cost 0.000056 US dollars. 30 days later, one eCash coin costs 0.000253 US dollars on the crypto exchange. This means that eCash's share price has risen by 450 percent.

One possible reason for eCash's rally could be the rebranding announced on July 1, 2021. Because the project was not always called eCash. Before that, it was still called ""Bitcoin Cash ABC"".

 **2nd place: Fantom (FTM)** 

The second place goes to Fantom (FTM). On August 16, the price of a Fantom coin was still quoted at 0.41 US dollars. One month later, on September 15, one had to pay 1.41 US dollars for an FTM. A growth of 343 percent.

At the moment, both NFT and DeFi applications are arguably the most hyped investment themes in the crypto sector. Fantom should benefit most from the fact that the project has a foot in both industries. That's because Fantom has a presence in both the DeFi and NFT sectors.

 3rd place: Avalanche (AVAX) 

Avalanche (AVAX) secured third place. On August 16, one AVAX could be purchased for 20.8 US dollars. One month later, the price of AVAX is already 52.76 US dollars. This is not as big an increase in price as the first place, but with AVAX, crypto investors were able to increase their money by 253 percent.

AVAx is the first smart contract platform to process more than 4,500 transactions per second and instantly confirm transactions.

1632553548,24,1,"Almost all of the crypto projects we deal with in our portfolios are still minting new coins. Though always decreasing its output, Bitcoin will be mining new coins until 2140, and many legitimate coins, such as DOT, or *shitcoins*, such as Doge, don't have supply caps, setting themselves up as inflationary coins. So what are the projects in the top 50 that have already minted 100% of their coins? Please note, judging a coin solely on whether it has reached Max Supply is not smart, and I am not trying to shill any of the following coins.

**#5 Binance Coin** \- Currently capped at 168 Million BNB. at In 2017, Binance launched an ICO (initial coin offering) for 100 Million BNB. Another 100 Million BNB was given to the founders and investors, so the cap at the time was 200 Million BNB. Binance Coin is deflationary, which is one of the reasons why the current amount of BNB is circulation is lower. It plans to burn half of its supply to increase the coins value.

**#32 THETA** \- For the video streaming blockchain, capped at 1 Billion THETA. All coins were minted from the start. Though harder to find exact information, 600-750 Million THETA coins were offered to the public during the ICO, while the rest were split between the team.

**#25 TRON (TRX)** \- TRON is a blockchain technology. It was created with a limited supply of 100 Billion TRX, with plans to burn more overtime as a deflationary measure. On release, 55 Billion of supply was sold to investors while 45 Billion was kept by the founder and project. Currently, there are 71.6 Billion TRX in circulation and that number will continue to go down.

**#50 IOTA (MIOTA)** \- A very unique project, a distributed ledger, not exactly a blockchain. IOTA was birthed at its Capped Supply of **2,779,530,283** (very specifically for ternary computation). No plans to change this number.

Of the top 50 coins, only 4 of them have reached their capped supply, and a couple of these projects are using deflationary methods to even remove coins from circulation. Are these good investments? Well that's up to you to decide. I personally am not invested in these coins, though I find the research interesting and important when planning for future assets.

Special note to **Maker MKR**, which had reached its ""total supply"" and is actually under that number, but is susceptible to future coin minting caused by market prices and conditions based on the DAI stablecoin. It could go up or down. Also note, in the top 50, **BTC, BCH, LTC, AAVE, CRO,** and **BSV** have **above 79%** of their Max Supply in circulation. **ADA, VET, NEO** are between **71-74%**.

Please keep in mind, these are just notes, and you should not buy any coin simply because of one factor, let alone this one. If there are any errors or additions needed please let me know.

Irrefutable, unchangeable, unique, those are probably a list of a few words that can be used to describe blockchain technology. This however is not a new story as you probably already knew this. Anyways, have you ever thought about the fact that despite the inherent uniqueness if the blockchain, as with other industries, similarities between two projects or out-right duplication is becoming a norm!

Now, have you in all your interactions with the blockchain had an encounter with a project or ecosystem whose purpose is to provide vast improvements to the DEFI ecosystem? Have you? .... There you go, you have not. Well, I am presenting to you; **Rigel protocol.**

Rigel Protocol is a protocol built to improve and touch up existing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) features while introducing several innovative DeFi products to propel scalability, security in the Blockchain, user experience and adoption.

In the event you are wondering what scalability means, it is basically the ability if a blockchain to handle increasing demands as the interactions on it continue to increase.

Why is Rigel Protocol Great?

**Community**

Rigel Protocol is centered around a strong community, the team believes that achieving its objectives can be better or more efficiently realized through proper community inclusion and that is why one of the most important thing the team is doing is building a robust community on various social media platforms, recently a call for applications was issued to invite suitably qualified and interested individuals to apply for ambassadorial roles to aid the growth of the community.

There are also ways to incentivize the community and encourage interaction with the project. Liquidity providers on the Rigel Protocol platform will have a chance to receive unique NFTs with estimated values from $5,000 to $50,000 this amount depends on the amount of liquidity provided.

**Security**

As blockchain technology develops and more projects come into being, there is always the reality that the space could be targeted by fraudsters, we see this in cases of hacks and also where the owners of projects rug pull a token after they have defrauded the community of a sizable sum.

Rigel protocol has proven to its community and the general public that security will not be an issue for concern, as can be seen in their website, Rigel protocol has partnered with Certik security foundation, a well known blockchain security solutions provider to provide security against hacks also insuring the project against hacks of up to $1million there is also a token allocated insurance of up to 3.2million RGP.

Rigel Protocol has a clear plan on how to achieve their goals and a visit to the [website](http://www.rigelprotocol.com/) would give you a clear picture of what to expect. You can also join all their social media channels for the latest updates about the project.

1633331942,103,1,"So something that a lot of newer people might not know about is you can get a passive income with and around cyrpto very easily. Please note the scope of this isn't to teach the exact. This is just the basics to point you to the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

DeFi and decentralized exchanges

IMO this is the most profitable way of getting passive income. But there is some level of risk. I'm going to be using Pancake Swap as an example. But with places like Pancake swap you can put up a pair of requested tokens and in return with that exchange you get cake. The amount you get is depending on the pair. The amount can easily be around 130% APR. Normally 50% APR. Keep in mind as the value of stuff goes up so does this skyrocket your earnings. Note the pool and note some exchanges give the ability to compound daily.

For Defi projects I'm picking on AAVE, and note while I do yeild farm with decentralized exchanges. I don't do this because the ARP normally is below 10%. Some tokens you can get in the 300% APR or more. But this is rare. More than less there is safer ways with many coins to make around that.

Mining

There is GPU mining, CPU mining, and then new type of ""mining""

CPU mining is almost never worth it. GPU mining with a RTX 2080 you're looking at about $3 a day. Keep in mind the more the coin price goes up after you get the coin, the more it's worth the more you actually made that day. So while $3 today, if the coin 10x over the years then you really made $30 a day.

The new type of mining is things like Helium which uses radio towers or Chia which uses your hard drive. There is others but it comes down to not actual mining, but being paid for renting space on your computer or being paid to keep some sensor or radio tower up. Note the amount you get from such things is very low, and the miner tends to be extremely expensive. Like $500 on the low end for some radio tower thing which realistically you can't do anything with anyways. There is a 5G one coming out, but the cost of that after all the hardware can be $2,500+. Basically not realistic for most.

&amp;#x200B;

Staking

Staking in general can be down to locked or unlocked. Lock is basically where you need to lock for a set amount of time. Lets pick on Algo. Algo as of writing this has an unlock staking program. But they are switching to a lock program soon. This means at this time just by holding it you have more coins coming in. You can trade or move it any time. The locked for Algo will now require you to hold it for 3 months and vote each time there is a vote. Normally for locked staking you only need to lock it for a set amount of time. 

Normal staking amount you can get is 5%-10%. This means if you have a value of coins worth $1m. You will get $50k a year just for holding the coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Far better than the banks :P

&amp;#x200B;

Reflections

Reflections are newer. Basically reflections in most coins like Octans, Safemoon, and others work by when you trade or transfer there is a ""tax"". Lets say 10% to keep the math easy. With most half of that is burnt and the other half is sent to you. But at the end of the day with all of them a part is sent to you. This is highly unreliable but might be profitable over the years.

To understand this problem you first need to know about the first major Proof of Stake  ( POS) project, Peer Coin: 
 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peercoin.asp

Which at one point was the 4th largest coin on the market  by Mkt Cap. Now it's in the ~700 

Its failures ironically becoming the selling points for projects like DOT. More precisely the ability to have a large stake in the project in perpetuity with little to no risk. By this I mean that by acquiring a large amount of the token you can stake it and earn rewards indefinitely while also controlling the governance of the network 

This is why fair launched projects no longer exist as most new projects are POS. As the developers are both forced and financial incentivised to pre-mine a controlling stake in the base token. As to not go into individual projects will focus on DOT that has turned this into a marketing tool to VCs 

Since DOT currently dosn't have parachains we can only assume that it will follow the current events occurring in its sister chain KSM

1. The Devs pre-mine a controlling stake in the network 
2. They sell this to VCs and other investors. Creating a ""ruling class"" on the network 
3. They sell some in a public sale while the majority is held by the VCs and Devs in ""reserves"" or alleged ""community funds"" 
4. They stake their controlling stake and earn rewards that they sell to new capital. Gaining revenue while maintaining control 
5. When a parachain auction comes around; the ""ruling class"" ultimately decides what wins not the majority. 
6. The lock up is meaningless as they are interested in in perpetuity control of the network. They lock up and get a controlling stake in the new asset 
7. They repeat the process or dump the new coins to new capital 
8. Lock up ends they get their coins and the cycle continues with a new parachain 


There is no insensitive to relinquish control of the network and since the got KSM tokens at $1 ( now ~$340) and DOT $0.25 ( now ~$30) they can do this for years if not decades",CryptoCurrency,The in perpetuity problem with POS and more precisely DOT

But if you want to make money, you'll then have to accept that you need to get into coins with good marketing and community.

Hype can come from: Upcoming events, YouTubers talking about it, or if the creator of the coin is Charles Hoskinson.

When coinbureau makes a video about a coin, I just jump in, wait for the hype to come and get out. Coins that have good fundamentals are better for holding for years. They don't pump and dump.

Examples: BTC, ETH, DOT, LINK. You won't really see a 2x in a few weeks with these, but it's a good idea to hold them long term.

I do think that the long term is more important in the end. Some people will make money quick, but can they consistantly do that for years? That's most important.

But for now, it seems like marketing, hype, upcoming events etc are most important for quick money :)",CryptoCurrency,"During the bear market you buy coins with fundamentals, during the bull market coins with hype"

1633849080,3,1,"Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, ETH, so on... are not just local or national funds. They are planetary and interplanetary. Local and remote. They represent value on a scale beyond individual person or government. They represent a single, unified goal that we all strive for. Ultimately we are trying to come to know what we can show with our alignments of energies.

Off of the philosophical side of it. On a value side. Bitcoin for example, is a global currency. Its value is tied to the total value of all participating individuals, irregardless of location, time, age, gender. And, in reality, it's showing some serious stength. In the last 10 months, slightly over $1,000 in a Government Cash Reserve yielded approximately $0.10 (proof available upon request.) In comparison, slightly over $30 in BTC in an interest account over the last month alone yielded slightly over $0.10, and slightly over $0.80 in the same time as the cash reserve. (proof available upon request, Nyknyc, dyor, ayor.)

Now, am I saying dump your Cash Reserves and buy Crypto Currency? No. F*** no. Okay, well, maybe a little, but not more than a few percent, and especially not if you haven't already had skin in the game for a while.

Problem is, the moment he tries to move coins to an exchange and sell, everyone will be running out the door and his ""billions"" will have a record shattering level of slippage. He'd be lucky to get out with even a billion, realistically.

Not a terrible problem to have... but there's a better way to maximize on this trade

To the person who is HODLing the best trade in modern history, here's how you walk away with all your gains:

1. Find a billionaire like Mark Cuban that can float you a few hundred million ($250M to be exact)
2. Sign up for enterprise FTX and Binance accounts that allow up to 20X short leverage
3. Open up a $5B short position using $250M @ 20x leverage (Max leverage allowed by Binance, FTX etc.). With how much selling is being done to open your short position, your short is basically guaranteed to not be liq'ed before you've opened up the entire short. Also, since you haven't touched your initial coin position, nobody is alarmed that you are planning to dump
4. Right after your entire short position is opened, it's time to dump your coins on the open market. As you sell your coins, close an equal exposure to your short position. This is called a delta zero trade which will result in you securing the full value of your assets

The reason why this theoretically works is because the moment that the $5B Shiba whale out bounds even a single token, everyone will panic and sell. But the short position guarantees that for every dollar you lose on the tokens itself, the short makes up for it in whole

Obviously the implications of getting a cool $250M loan and then being able to transact such massive shorting volume on SHIB are monumentally difficult (and possibly impossible) tasks. This is more so a thought experiment than anything else. Either way, congrats on your gains you lucky bastard",CryptoCurrency,Here's how $5B Shiba Inu wallet holder can cash out with almost ZERO slippage

1635490576,65,1,"I got to thinking that it's surprising there hasn't been an It's Always Sunny episode about crypto so here it goes:

Charlie finds a phone in the alley while throwing out a trashbag full of vanquished rats. He opens it up and sees Kraken which he thinks is an app to buy crabs and nuts and other crackable delicacies. He accidently buys SHIB right before the pop thinking he was picking the SHIP that catches the crabs. He becomes a millionaire overnight. 

After seeing Charlie's success, Mac and Dee FOMO in at the top. SHIB proceeds to dump and they sell low to recoup what little money they have left. Not realizing they have to pay gas fees, they also end up losing the money they were able to pull out. 

Seeing Mac and Dee get swindled, Frank and Dennis decide to create a meme coin to pump and dump.They call it Birdcoin to trick people into thinking it's Bitcoin and also to make fun of Dee. Meanwhile they find out the Chinese fish shop across the street is actually just a cover for an illegal Bitcoin farm. Frank uses his business connections in China to turn Paddy's into a farm because he wants to push out the fish shop and ""Asian's know how to do all that nerd crap"".

Mac and Dee make deals with Frank and Dennis for a percentage of the profits. Mac and the guys from Ass Kickers United will renovate Paddy's and Dee will pretend to be Chinese, infiltrate the illegal farm, and steal their crypto ""plans""... Whatever that means. A week later Birdcoin is in the top 10. Frank and Dennis pull the rug and convert to Bitcoin. They're instant billionaires. Frank and Dennis go put deposits down on yachts because whoo-res love boats and of course... ""the implication"".

As they're off signing the paperwork on their new yachts, Cricket breaks in to Paddy's to steal the copper wire out of the mining rigs. The rigs begin to overheat and a fire breaks out. Paddy's burns to the ground taking with it the only piece of paper with Frank and Dennis's seed phrase. Or so they think... It turns out Mac had made a backroom deal with the Chinese fish shop to steal the seed phrase because he wants to play both sides. 

Frank and Dennis return to an empty wallet and a smoldering Paddy's. Mac goes to pick up his money from the Chinese and arrives to a vacant, boarded up fish shop. It turns out the owners were playing him. They sold the shop and returned to China with Dennis and Frank's Bitcoin in hand. Meanwhile Dee has gotten blackout drunk and slept with the guy who sweeps up the severed fish heads, again. 

As Frank, Dennis, Mac, and Dee stand in front of what used to be Paddy's in silence, Charlie walks up smiling holding several boxes of pizza and a VHS of Thundergun. He explains that right before the pop he traded his SHIB to buy pizza because The Waitress said she'd come over for dinner and a movie. She didn't actually show up because she  just wanted to make Charlie waste his money so now he's stuck with a bunch of cold pizza. Charlie offers them a slice and asks what had happened while he was gone. They all turn and look at him in shock while he munches away on some Little Ceasers. Right before Dennis let's loose a blood curtling scream we cut to credits. Cue the music.

1637308315,30,1,"A smart contract is a digital version of a standard paper contract, the terms of which are checked and executed automatically. In this case, an intermediary is not needed, since the contract code is checked by all network participants. The terms of the agreement are stored in a distributed database and cannot be changed.

The idea was proposed back in 1994 by the American scientist and digital currency researcher Nick Szabo.

On the one hand, a smart contract is just a program code, a common application like a calculator, messenger, or video game. On the other hand, a smart contract is a fundamental element of any distributed application (DApp) that operates in an environment without trust or centralized authority, such as a website administrator or government.

Where can smart contracts be applied?

Clearing in trade operations, coin converter crypto, and supply chains are the first candidates for the implementation of smart contracts. Other promising areas are healthcare, insurance, media, energy, archiving, and voting.¬†

Why aren‚Äôt smart contracts used in all areas?

¬†One of the main technical barriers to the full-scale implementation of smart contracts is the need to create effective and reliable oracles (external agents that are responsible for the reliability of the information provided from the outside). Oracles can be measuring instruments (thermometer or light sensor); specific network participants who provide services to the blockchain system; decentralized systems with their own consensus mechanisms built on top of the main ledger and more.

Another problem is the need for a new regulatory environment that takes into account the capabilities of the blockchain and determines the legal force of smart contracts (for example, ownership of real estate or items).

Summing up, we can say that smart contracts are a worthy replacement for classic and standard contracts. They greatly simplify the transaction process, provide a certain percentage of security, accuracy, and environmental friendliness of the transaction. However, there are still many issues that need to be worked out before contracts can be fully implemented in our lives.

1638861044,14,1,"I've been personally using Wazirx and shifting my assets to Binance. Most of the times Indian exchanges stop responding on mobile apps or desktop. During the recent dip, some of my orders on Wazirx weren't cancelled despite trying to cancel them on mobile or desktop. Fortunately, my capitol isn't big but for people who want to be full time traders or having solid capitol to deploy, losses can be huge and so can be profit.

My advice : Shift to Binance and they have more options where you can earn passive income on your crypto even if you don't trade it and just hold it. Binance earn has options to stake or flexible savings if you prefer a quick redeem option to take out your crpto. They do have alot of other options in Binance earn which you can choose to opt according to your portfolio and risk management. But do research and don't take anyone's blind advice if you're going for different earn options.

**Note: There's no fee for shifting to Binance from Wazirx and vice versa. Wazirx got acquired by Binance in 2019.**

[They also have application which you can use on all platforms](https://preview.redd.it/18ll3xb4i2481.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5c0d4b5a0d64af79b742dfb61f6686c9124d50c)

**How to shift from Wazirx to Binance?**

1. Create a Binance account , you can follow this video by CoinBureau [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJ6xkJpeUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzJ6xkJpeUk) or [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIsqkNFx1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIsqkNFx1c) by MoneyZG . I've followed them to signup for Binance account and after doing KYC my account was working. It took me a few minutes to set it up so it's not a big deal.  

2. After creating Binance account and linking it with your Wazirx account you can transfer in between them easily. Mind it that Binance doesn't have trading against INR so you can trade against USDT.

3. In case Wazirx goes down or stops responding, you'll be able to trade your crypto on Binance. Just shift your assets from Binance to Wazirx and cash it out to your bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

Note : Crypto is still new in India and alot of newcomers are into it thinking they can make huge profits. Though, this is true in world of crypto but there can be huge losses as well. For any newcomers who are new to crypto like me, please do a thorough research how the blockchain technology works and crypto comes into picture. 

Don't fall for clickbaiter youtubers, Twitter accounts or media outlets,do your own research. Sort this subreddit posts by *top all time* and go through them, read comments and research about them. Hope it helps someone!",CryptoCurrency,Shifting from Wazirx to Binance for Indian investors

As known with companies or more so corporations you are only taxed on profits minus expenses/purchases. Would this qualify as a purchase?

I know cheques, telephones and mail orders and then we should know crypto (but I am very much in the minority I think). I have been trading and investing in stocks since 2018. 

Anyway my opinion may matter. This is my point of view of crypto and take it or leave it:
1. Bear market may be gone forever. The halving cycle's effect will naturally be reduced as too much adoption has happened and BTC dominance has waned already and volume of trades completely has 6xed since 2018. But...
2. The volatility that was played with skill before with whales and early birds alike has continued but without the crazy volatility as before. But... They will manipulate always.
3. Metaverse is very very short term play. This will fuck up our dreams and psychologists will prove how stupid the whole thing is. It will have its place, but not as popular as Mr.Crapperburg thinks it wil be. Parents won't allow it.
4. Everyone has an agenda. Always remember this. I love Ral Paoul but he has most of his portfolio now in ETH basically because he was bullied by Bitcoin maxis IMO.
5. Do your fucking research. Think of price as a bullshit thing. If it goes down, it is 99% likely it is not a fundamental reason but because it follows BTC. Simple way. Look at Coingecko and price history and see if it is cheap or not if you really really lazy. That works too and I have done this too.

1639727343,0,1,"There was a meme that circulated a few months ago about government auditing of law-abiding, crypto-loving, tax-paying citizens into paying their fair share of crypto profits come tax season. 

It alluded to the idea that if the government has a way to know how much we really profited, to just tell us ahead of time so that we can pay that correct amount and get it over with. 

Why don‚Äôt we have that option in the US? 

Just let us link any centralized exchange account-generated PDFs and include any etherscan or bnb publicly available spreadsheet links and total it for us. 

Cut out the middle-man trying to profit off of us, the stress and anxiety of potentially making an honest mistake in our calculations, and treat us like human beings that are trying to do the right thing.

Why do we have to stress about not paying the exact, correct amount or pay an accountant when they have the ability to quickly and easily let us know up front how much we owe?

I'm a Kucoin user and have been using their stacking plateforme to stack 85% of my portfolio. 
However I'm starting to think that it's not that interesting, specialty because a majority of my stacked portfolio are Luna's.
For exemple, apparently they keep all the airdrops to themselves which isn't great

I'm thinking of either moving it to terra station or Anchor for my Luna, or Nexo.io for everything (I want 0 risk except normal marked volatility)

What's your feedback of Nexo.io ? Do you know any good stacking plateforme ?

""The trial also used cutting edge distributed ledger technologies, powered by global distributed ledger network, Hedera Hashgraph, for the registration and verification of the credential records. eftpos is a Governing Council member of Hedera and Meeco is a partner of Hedera.""

Managing Director of eftpos Digital Identity, Andrew Black, said the trial demonstrated the real-world benefits digital identity can yield for both workers and businesses, with results showing:

* The time for a HR team to onboard a new worker was reduced from **72 hours to 30 minutes**
* The time for a new worker to provide necessary credentials information was reduced from **48 hours to 30 minutes**
* 100% of participants (both HR teams and employees) found the new process easier than the current process.

 ‚ÄúDigital Identity has been largely talked about as authentication and logins. Credentials like driver licences are still the dominant form of representing identity in the community. Linking digital credentials to a digital account creates a complete digital identity solution, and we are very grateful to be able to work with industry and businesses to prove and realise that vision.‚Äù

1640161189,0,1,"Anchor is designed as a savings protocol that gives a fixed yield to those that deposit UST on the platform. As of right now, Anchor promises a fixed rate of 20% APY. In addition, you can use Anchor as a way to borrow UST using bLUNA (bonded LUNA) as collateral. Although 20% returns may sound too good to be true, it does have a sound mechanism to achieve this peg. Anchor is able to give such a large APY by depositing all collateral used into earning staking rewards through the PoS system. Using ANC tokens as incentive, they are able to facilitate borrowing at a maximum LTV of 50%, which essentially means the amount borrowed (and in this case the amount deposited) will equal half as much as the amount collateralized. Since LUNA‚Äôs current rewards are 12%, with double the amount of collateral they are able to create 24% returns, of which 20% go to the depositor and 4% are put back into the system.",CryptoCurrency,How does Anchor protocol achieve high APY on Luna blockchain??

**Note:**

This is the sixth in a twelve part series I'm doing on centralized exchanges. This part is going to focus on the why the collapse of Mt.Gox was so devastating and also start building the case of the issues with modern day CEXs with a story from my personal life

&amp;#x200B;

**Part 6: Worst Case Scenario**

It is hard to articulate how bad of a scenario the Mt. Gox hack was. Not just in financial terms but in human suffering. I hope that Parts 3 to 5 have shown you how the crypto-currency space is designed to conduct some kind of [Psychological Operation (PSYOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)) and this helps you understand the kind of mental stress the victims of Mt.Gox went through and are going through. There is a reason why [the suicide prevention hotline was up top on r/cryptocurrency](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjpkgn/bitcoin-price-dip-suicide-hotline-reddit) at one point

The customers of Mt.Gox lost millions if not billions of dollars each. More importantly the lives that money could have given them. It was a worst case scenario

The CEX was essentially insolvent and the BTC was just gone

[200,000 BTC was eventually recovered](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/will-mt-gox-victims-finally-get-200-000-btc) and hopefully will be distributed [as the creditors agreed](https://cryptopotato.com/mt-gox-rehabilitation-plan-now-binding-crypto-proponents-deny-major-bitcoin-price-impact/). However it is nearly 8 years later and some of them are not with us

It frightens me that nearly all market participants are now in a similar position to those poor souls in 2014. Full of hopes and dreams of a promised crypto bull run that will make them ""financially independent"". Built on the back of a shady business that can go tits up any second. At the end of the last part I hinted at doing a deep dive into what [many consider to be crypto's biggest systemic risk; USDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-whuXHSL1Pg&amp;t=647s&amp;ab_channel=Coffeezilla). But feel a lot of people who cover USDT don't cover the entire system. They are fixated on just one part of a complex web. So to try and show how complex and bad a system can get. I will tell you the tale of:

***The Beverage Heist***

***Background:***

A couple of years ago I worked as an administrator for a large resort during one of the most complex and baffling case of employee negligence and theft

Anyway this resort was divided in to three sections each with its own bar and beverage

1. Accommodation: hotel bar and restaurant used exclusively by hotel guests
2. Entertainment area: 2 restaurants, 2 bars, 1 beverage bar (no alcohol), 1 cocktail bar and a night club with a bar: Used by hotel guests and day visitors
3. Family area: with 1 beverage bar used by day visitors

The place was massive and it had separated entrances for guests but walkways for employees to get around. Because of this while one company they had different prices for beverages in the family area and other two. It cost the company $0.30 a Coke, Pepsi etc... and they sold them in the Accommodation and Entertainment bars for $1.50 and $1 in the Family. As the Family area usually got more guests so the volume of sales was higher

The beverage system was that there where 5 barmen and a beverage manager at a Central bar ( CB). Each bar operated independently and only interacted with the CB to get restocked if their stock was low and to hand in cash sales at the end of the day. A typical week was that from Friday to Sunday they would sell 2000 -5000 units of non-alcoholic beverages. On Monday there would be a stock take and at the end of the day or Tuesday morning this would be sent to our office for review. On Tuesday or Wednesday a new order for beverages would be placed to the suppliers based on the stock take and what needs replacing. Thursday a delivery is made before the weekend

***The surprise check:***

On a random Monday in July we decided to do a physical stock take with the barmen and the CB manager . We showed up and did the rounds with them. Took about 2hrs to 3hrs. We had blank sheets where we basically just counted how many drinks where in display fridges, the back of each bar etc.... Drove back to the town office and decided to go over them on Tuesday ( We obviously did more work, I remember the whisky and wine stuff taking ages)

So on Tuesday we started going over the stocks and we did this by entering them in a system that was linked to the pay-points at the resort. So it would automatically detect an issue. We where off by a couple thousand units (\~$1000 to $1500) worth of stock. This obviously raised a big flag. Because each bar was independent and now we had missing stock across all six. So we ordered the replacement stock and decided to drive out on Wednesday to figure out what happened. As because of the size of the resort and CCTVs on the pathways it only meant that there where unrecorded sales (missing funds)

***The heist***

So we set up shop in the hotel managers office and started interviewing each of the barmen. It turned out that the two of the barmen had been restocking not from the CB but from the other bars. The Family sections barman had been smart enough to keep a book of all the times they had taken stock from him. It was a lot, but he had maintained his stock by getting it back from the CB later. This meant that on average 4 of the bars where fractionally stocked with the CB under stocked and 2 bars overstocked. However based on our Monday stock take all the bars where understocked based on the sales

After hours of interviews and going over CCTV footage and sales records we got it:

1. The two barmen had a deal with both the CB manager and the delivery van to purchase drinks off the van at the co at company rate
2. They would use these beverages to cover up the stock they would sell for cash on weekends and pocket the difference ( $600 - $1000) each weekend
3. Because the CB manager was responsible for sending the stock on Monday she would falsify the stock on hand
4. Their plan had been to frame the other barmen in the event of getting busted by making all the bars look bad and thus remove suspicion off their two
5. Unfortunately they got greedy and instead of being off by a couple of units they where off by thousands

Based on what the Family section barmen had written this had been going on for at least 2 years so they had stolen at least $100,000; just from beverages

Now imagine on CEXs where there are no checks and balances. You just give these people your crypto and hope they aren't sending each other your property in a complex scheme of maintaining fictitious balances.

The SEC may be the administrator who shows up and discovers that there is not enough crypto on stock. CEXs (1) sent it to CEX (2) to cover a withdrawal. The CB is just pretending to be the moral center but is involved in the shady business

However unlike me and my work mate, the SEC can't phone Satoshi to deliver more BTC for he weekend. This is the worst case scenario",CryptoCurrency,The Ghost of Mt.Gox Part 6: Worst Case Scenario

1641801109,1,1,"If a random person with no knowledge of cryptocurrency saw this they would think that the markets are crazy.

It is completely normal for an asset class to have a year where it has little price action.  This is actually healthy.

Now consider and contrast the two $42k price zones.

One year ago BTC had basically doubled in a few weeks.  Everybody was FOMOing in.  Alts were getting rekt and I recall selling my ETH for BTC because it seemed unstoppable.  Extreme greed kicked in, and what happened?  We got rekt, falling to 28k in a fairly short time frame - a massacre.  In hindsight you were crazy to have bought that run.

And yet, now we have the exact mirror image opposite.  We are talking Star Trek style, mirror dimension (Spock is evil and has a beard etc opposite).  Down from $69k but at the same level, people I know are capitulating and selling or even thinking of shorting.  The same folk who were desperate to get in a year ago as the bull cycle had no top.

Now in retrospect we know that (for the short term at least) - doing a FOMO buy at $42k in January last year was a bad idea.  Heck, there was a guy on this sub who bought at that price and was posting about how he couldn't sleep from the lost money for the next few weeks.

We ALSO know that doing a FOMO sell at the various fear levels this year ($28k, $30k, $39k and so forth) was a terrible idea and instead buying was the plan.  Equally buying at the extreme greed tops was a bad idea.

So if you treat it as a psychological war game - would it make any sense at all that now is a good time to either sell everything and walk away?  Sure it could go down.  It might go down a bit more yet, but the risk reward has always favored buying in extreme fear scenarios for the entire history of crypto.  

And as a final point, it looks like funding finally flipped negative.  So those short position holders who have suffered over the last few days are now paying long positions for the privilege, despite losing a bucket of money.",CryptoCurrency,"The price of bitcoin is essentially flat from 1 year ago ($42k).

You see, most often, markets are cyclical in nature. They don‚Äôt like to play around neither at the top nor at the bottom. On a long enough time-chart, the market follows a strict S-curve, and this could be a valuable key for those looking to invest, and turn a t*rd into gold. The market rarely remains at one crest for too long, and where it is currently is very vital for the veteran trades and the new beginners alike.  

Yes, BTC WILL RECOVER. As much FUD out there as there is, this is bound to happen, but as I stated before, even if it does a complete recovery and pushes its way up to 100k, your portfolio will only go up 2x‚Ä¶ 

I KNOW 2X IS A LOT. If your portfolio is 25k now, 50k is a good place to be. If it is 300k, it‚Äôll be 600k. But what if it is 100$? Is 200$ enough?

Let‚Äôs be clear here, not everyone in crypto has a massive portfolio. In fact, the majority out there, have a sum less than 1k USD, you can be assured of that. I am speaking for those people when I say, BTC or any massive capital investment is not the way to go. By the time you make it to 500$, inflation will have caught on‚Ä¶

For those people, and to be clear I say this as my investments are on the smaller side, it is better to invest time and money in smaller tokens with big potential.

Ideas like (Centrifuge)[https://twitter.com/centrifuge?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor] and their DeFi Protocols, or an NFT idea like the Royal Falcons Club)[https://twitter.com/RFC5050] if that‚Äôs the type of market you‚Äôre after.

I've been in investments however for roughly 16 years. But I found if you don't have money, then you can't make any. And the system within normal stock trading is seriously built against average retail investors. (Like my average is around 20% ROI in the stock market. But if you have something like $100, then the best you will get is $20 before trading fees and taxes.)

What I found over my long while with crypto is investing side of things, this is easier to make money. But it isn't a ton easier. Like TA and all that easily transfers over. But again, if you don't have much money to start with. Then it is virtually impossible to make a serious amount without extreme luck.

Now what caused me to gain some hope due to crypto is a lot of stuff in and around it.

* Staking and mining massively helps. Basically, where I normally have to make handmade items to make money or depend on income from older how-to videos I made on YouTube. This gives me a new way to make money. And the best part about this is it is passive. Being no matter how I feel, what I'm doing, or whatever. The amount I get is highly regular. And while it isn't a lot. It is enough to help and to see a path to success.
* Metaverse and other things like that actually has allowed me to meet cool people, and experience things I would've never been able to. Now with that being said, I haven't spent a dime on the metaverse.

1643271215,2,1,"Polygon Studios, the gaming and non-fungible token (NFT) arm of Polygon (MATIC), recently had a new CEO. Former head of gaming at YouTube, Ryan Wyatt, has made the move to the crypto company and will work there to develop blockchain gaming and Web3.

&amp;#x200B;

**From YouTube to Polygon**

Polygon Studios is focused on developing decentralized gaming, making the Polygon network more attractive for the Web3 transition and attracting more users. Wyatt joins from YouTube, where under his leadership the gaming branch attracted more than 250 million daily users. In a statement, Wyatt explains what he will focus on as CEO of Polygon Studios:

&amp;#x200B;

*""I will focus on growing the developer ecosystem through investment, marketing and developer support and bridging the gap between Web 2.0 and 3.0. I will lead the Polygon Studios organization in the areas of gaming, entertainment, fashion, news, sports and more.""*

**Polygon invests $100 million**

Last summer, Polygon announced the launch of its gaming arm. Then it also announced it would invest a whopping $100 million in the company. At the time, Polygon wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

*""We are excited to work on this mission to serve as a gateway bridging Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, and we aim to further strengthen our dominant position as the de-facto platform for decentralized gaming to earn and Blockchain Gaming.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Polygon implements EIP-1559**

Polygon is a so-called layer 2 solution for Ethereum (ETH). It makes transactions on the network cheaper and is based on a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol. Recently, the network implemented EIP-1559. That update introduced a mechanism that destroys part of the transaction cost.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, MATIC has become deflationary. The stock will decrease by about 0.27% annually, the developers recently announced. MATIC was able to rise nicely over the past 24 hours and is up almost 9%. Over the past 7 days, however, the altcoin has been significantly down like the rest of the market.",CryptoCurrency,"YouTube top executive becomes CEO of Polygon Studios, MATIC reacts"

1643271127,2,1,"Far removed from mainstream attention and the spotlight exists a small cryptocurrency called TrumpCoin (TRUMP). This altcoin is of course named after former President Donald J. Trump and only has a market capitalization of about $1.5 million. Nevertheless, the Trump family is not a fan of the cryptocurrency. Eric Trump recently even announced on Twitter that legal action might be taken against the crypto project.

&amp;#x200B;

**TrumpCoin**

TRUMP was founded in 2016 with the aim of supporting Donald Trump's election campaign at the time. It therefore claims to be a cryptocurrency created by ""patriots, for patriots."" Whether TrumpCoin actually contributed to the election of Donald Trump remains to be seen.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case, Eric Trump, son of Donald Trump, is not enamored with the crypto project. According to him, the project is guilty of using the Trump name in a fraudulent manner.

The team behind TrumpCoin seems to care little about this. On the contrary, they seem to have anticipated possible legal action. In a response to Eric Trump's Tweet, they stated that the TrumpCoin website clearly states that they have no ties to the Trump organization and that they are not officially affiliated with them in any way.

Finally my personal experience is, In my case Bittrex blocked my account because i need to prove some identity after 1.5 years of using bittrex, when bit coin started getting rise they want identity verification which took them 1 year to complete the verification after my several tickets and several posts, and when it was opened after one and half year, there was no money in my account, on further several tickets of 1 year they told me that your money was stolen by someone during your account block period, does it makes sense??

If my account was blocked and i was myself not able to access it then how hacker took out the money, it is so open to hackers, i was thinking my account is only blocked but at least money or bitcoin is going up, but on other side on backend the bittrex themself was taking out my money.

Now when I am asking them clarification on this that how come money went out from my account when it was in blocked state, they simply stopped sending me OTP on my email that is required to login to website, so simple neither you will get OTP neither you will login neither you can ask them clarification on their money stealing scam.

And here are some common FAQs in a [video](https://youtu.be/TgCktFuWTq0) but also addressed down below:

 **Q1: If I have a crypto account. Within that crypto account I bought \_\_\_\_ coin and then sold for a profit, but do not transfer the money out of the account. Will I still need to pay taxes?** 

*A: Yes, when you sell your crypto regardless of whether or not you withdraw the money this will have tax implications. If you sell for a profit you will have realized a gain. If you sold at a loss you can use that to offset other gains. You can also offset your regular income with a loss up to $3,000 (anything in excess of $3,000 can be carried over to the following tax year).*

**Q: If I buy \_\_\_\_ coin and hold, but never sell. Do I need to pay taxes.**  

*A: In this situation, you do not need to pay taxes. You have not finished the transaction because you have not sold your position. This is considered an unrealized gain. While the value has increased, you won't owe any taxes until you realize your gain (or loss) by selling.*

**Q: How much will I owe in taxes?** 

*A: Depending on how long you held that specific coin you will either be taxed at the short-term capital gains rate or the long-term capital gains rate. Anything that you held for less than a year will fall into the short-term rate and anything longer than a year will be taxed at the long-term rate. For short-term capital gains, the rate is equal to your income tax rate (bracket). On long-term capital gains taxes, unless you make in excess of \~$400,000 (it varies depending on your filing status) you'll be taxed at a 15% rate. If you make over \~$400k, then you'll be taxed at 20%.* 

**Q: What is the tax treatment if you are lending cryptos or using a trading robot?** 

*A: Any income you receive for lending your crypto will be treated as interest and is viewed as the same as interest you earn on the money in your savings account. Depending on the trading platform you use, you may be issued a 1099-INT or you will have to create one on your own if you're not using a US based platform. This will be taxed with your income tax rate.*

**Q: Can I reinvest crypto gains to defer taxes?** 

*A: Unfortunately, no. Unlike rental properties you cannot make a like kind  1031 exchange. The IRS explicitly stated you cannot defer taxes on cryptos.*  

This is the basics of what you need to know, if you have any specific questions your best bet is to consult with a CPA to make sure your taxes are done correctly.",CryptoCurrency,"For US holders, here are some basic tax FAQs with regards to crypto"

I remember the days when 4,000 users browsing this subreddit was considered a large number of users browsing this sub. I've made posts previously about how 80% of the users that we had before wouldn't [be around 18 months later](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mwkw6a/80_of_you_who_read_just_the_title_of_this_thread/) go relatively ignored. I've also made threads warning people that from the 2017 bull-run all the way until now, only [10 or so coins have surpassed their previous all-time-highs](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpi6ky/the_only_coins_in_the_top_10_that_have_surpassed/) and those have gone *mostly* ignored. This just leads me to believe that the altcoin market is becoming this roulette wheel where you put your desired number of chips on a desired number or color and then wait for the ball to drop on various random numbers and colors at varying times.              

I am staking and yield farming, don't get me wrong, for purposes of understanding yield rates and income rates, but **the core problem of this market cycle is the absolute plethora of new people we have that don't understand the market.** If you don't know what you are doing, if you haven't been in this market for a full four-year-cycle, if you don't know why numbers go up, then you should just buy bitcoin and DCA in to the market slowly. I am pretty sure that this is the only guaranteed strategy in crypto. You can also use this to build yourself a strong base to invest a *conservative* amount of money in altcoins at a later time.                 

I am strongly of the persuasion that the last time you could have bought any coin that went 100x or 500x was in summer 2020, if you were patient enough to hold.              

Now let's talk inflation. Bitcoin will continue to trend higher over a course of years. Meanwhile the amount of FIAT currency in circulation is increasing, leading to inflation for Americans, hyper-inflation or near-hyper-inflation in some countries, and (generally over the long term) devaluation of many currencies vs. the USD. The theme of this bull run with bitcoin is lightning adoption, and with services like cash app and strike becoming further adopted, we will see people able to purchase 5 dollars of bitcoin and get their 5 dollars of bitcoin at pennies worth of transaction fees or none at all. In other words, the previous impossible feat of buying 1 dollar of bitcoin and receiving 1 dollar of bitcoin will start trending away.",CryptoCurrency,"HODL'ing is the answer if and only if you can wait four years, but you can educate yourself now on coins besides BTC / ETH."

In recent years, the internet freelance economy has exploded, largely owing to changes in working practices and attitudes toward cost-effective business solutions. The bitcoin market has been growing at an unprecedented rate. According to publicly available data, around 5,300 distinct types of cryptocurrencies are exchanged mostly on market, totaling more over $200 billion in market value. According to industry study forecasts, the worldwide bitcoin payment ecosystem would be valued 630 million US dollars by 2025, with a double-digit annual growth rate of 23.4 percent between 2020 and 2025.

Things are improving, and employees may now be paid in virtual currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum instead of traditional fiat money. It removes the stumbling block of how freelancers are compensated for working for customers in other countries. It becomes easier to locate customers willing to pay on your terms.

**Gooreo as a future changer:**

Gooreo is a pioneer marketplace platform for worldwide freelancers that allows for flexible, quick, and cost-effective bitcoin payments. A ground-breaking autonomous crypto hub that performs fast transactions at minimal cost with no hidden fees. The Gooreo coin powers the Gooreo platform. Furthermore, Gooreo hosts a built-in DeFi investing engine for crypto investors, GoFioo.

GoFioo - a DeFi kernel for global investors ‚Äì is hosted on the Gooreo platform. GoFioo is an investment wallet and a Gooreo token staking depository for worldwide investors interested in staking Gooreo currency. Within GoFioo, the Gooreo token will be the processing cryptocurrency for payment or investment. Global investors can invest in any cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH, BNB, BUSD, etc.).

**Benefits associated with cryptocurrency and Gooreo:**

¬∑ **Paying Employees Could Be More Convenient with Cryptocurrency**

Managing payroll for a remote team of employees who reside in different parts of the world may be a huge burden for a remote team employer. . Consider having to pay your employees by translating your dollars into hundreds of different foreign currencies.

Transacting across borders isn't nearly as complicated as changing currencies.. Cryptocurrencies now allow for instant cross-border transactions at little or no cost. Because Bitcoin transactions are public, anybody can view the transaction information and determine the status immediately. Eliminating banks saves money for both the company and the employee, creating a win-win situation.

¬∑ **Cryptocurrency As a Payment Method**

One of the most common accusations towards cryptocurrency is that it has no inherent worth. Indeed, the value it has is the value it receives from the rest of the world. The same might be said about global fiat currencies that abandoned the gold standard long since.

For years, proponents of gold holdings have known that excessive money production will cause currency depreciation. They use gold to hedge against inflation and keep the government out of their bank accounts since gold has a limited supply and has historically been regarded as precious.

Coins are held by some of the most ardent cryptocurrency users for many reasons people retain the gold. The biggest difference between the two is cryptocurrency's infancy, with no track record of long-term worth.

Crypto excels at the ability to keep your coins safe utilizing an offline wallet and having a finite quantity that drives exponential value growth as demand rises. With the capacity to rapidly move coins anywhere on the planet, cryptocurrency's demand and total value may rise, making it a popular form of payment in commercial and peer-to-peer worlds.

**Why consider using crypto through Gooreo?**

Because crypto has certain basic qualities, it can have a significant influence on this market.

¬∑ Global payments with no borders

¬∑ Payment is made instantly, and there is a minimal payment cost.

¬∑ There is no currency exchange issue.

¬∑ As with international transfers, your money travels from bank to bank and takes days to reach your account, with exchange rates set by banks (Most of the time, you will not be happy with that).

Gooreo handles this by transferring money directly between the customer and the freelancer. You are no longer obliged to pay a significant payment penalty. This is quite powerful.

16 percent of freelancers want to be paid more quickly. This is understandable given the potential risks associated with internet payments. In the instance of Upwork, the user must wait for the client to approve the payment, then wait 5 days for the cash to enter their account, and finally wait for the bank to complete the payment. This will most likely take a few weeks.

Payments with cryptocurrency are quick, even between nations. This is advantageous for freelancers since cryptocurrencies can be exchanged, and cash can be withdrawn and spent immediately following confirmation.

Cryptocurrency also gives 39 percent of the world's unbanked population access to financial services. Millions of individuals can now use the Internet, yet banks cannot. The bitcoin market eliminates the need for banks.

**Benefits for Freelancers**

¬∑ Money enters the wallet more quickly.

¬∑ Lower commissions imply that earnings may be increased or interest rates can be reduced to improve competitiveness.

¬∑ Millions of individuals who do not have access to banks can participate in the freelancing economy.

¬∑ Tokenized reputation means that reputation Equals money, and consumers have a vested interest.

¬∑ Because there is less centralized control, business and income are safer and will not be unfairly deprived.

Gooreo believes that freelancing platforms will begin to embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency when it comes to being paid. Cryptocurrency might be used to compensate freelancers. And blockchain has many potential benefits for freelancers and those who work with them. For example, blockchain might be used to monitor freelancer work inside a platform and their previous project history and how successfully they performed the task.

Payments done using blockchain technology will be significantly faster. Well-known payment processors might take several days to transfer money into a freelancer's bank account. Of course, you could pay a larger fee to access the money faster, but that's not very enticing when costs are already stacking up. Using blockchain, the transactions might be sped up to receive money in minutes rather than days.",CryptoCurrency,Why Gooreo Going To Change The Freelance Game?

But what excatly means decentralised in crypto?

* **No central authority** \- Resources are owned and shared by network members. Nobody owns network and hardware resources
* There is no ""single point of failure"". We have an example with miners all over the world, if one goes down, the other ones will keep working. More miners means stronger network.
* Security is being increased as the number of network members increase. 
* Performance decreases as the number of network member increase 
* You don't have to trust anyone - every member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a distributed ledger. If a member's ledger is altered or corrupted, it will be rejected by the majority of the members in the network.

I could use the bitcoin now and save $40 on my $80 purchase or I could wait until bitcoin hits it ath again and save $70.

i guess NFT makes sense only for exclusive content. and where the customer can't even sample the entire version of the content before even buying it. caus if the customer could sample the whole image/audio/etc. before buying, then it's already been decrypted and could be copied. and then also, the artist would have to price their content high enough and make it artificially scarce enough that it would be harder to find the source. and then that would invite hackers to attempt hacking NFT customers/artists for the content. so i guess thats what will happen with NFT, bunch of artists will start off publicly sharing their art and then some amount of them will go more NFT-exclusive with their content. it will be a lucrative opportunity for any artist to be invited into a closed NFT circle of buyers. and increased hacking all around the digital art space.



with the above views in mind, i dont see how people are claiming NFT is good for artists. NFT looks quite bad for art and artists. art becoming somewhat more exclusive and inaccessible. and more content hacks in the art space. not good for artists.

It's just that today I received a letter from a friend, like yesterday you closed the deal + 15%, and today the coin shot another 20% (we are talking about the EPS coin).

I tried to explain to him that the May strategy is not designed to capture the entire market movement, and it‚Äôs not realistic to take it all with at least one transaction, no one knows when the market will turn around or where it will go, but of course there are guidelines in technical analysis , someone uses moving averages and so on, but these are only guidelines, not a guarantee.

In general, in May the strategy is simple, I take 10-15% from the market on each position if the market is slow, and if I see a backache, I take more sometimes 20-50%, but this is rare, but to collect a little bit and increase the deposit it fits me.

In this regard, of course, everyone decides for himself how to invest, but in order to get X10, you first need to guess with a coin, but it may not go or give as much, and then how long to wait?

1648541535,1,1,"**The meta universe proposed as early as 1992 has existed silently for nearly 30 years. How can it suddenly catch fire? Bryn came to talk to everyone today!**

&amp;#x200B;

**In fact, the benign development of anything is inseparable from the three elements of timing, geography and people. Timing is a key element. The imagination of unrestrained imagination, early, is either a madman or a martyr. It is genius and hero who seize the opportunity.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The rise of metauniverse seems accidental. In fact, it is an inevitable phenomenon that the popularity of VR / AR technology in recent years, coupled with the rapid development of cloud computing, blockchain, chip, 5g and artificial intelligence technology, has promoted the landing of the concept of metauniverse.**

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the underlying technologies of the meta universe?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Roughly speaking, metauniverse includes such technologies as chip technology, network communication technology, virtual reality technology, game technology, ai artificial intelligence technology and blockchain technology.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The meta universe is a digital universe and a parallel world. Therefore, the meta universe is based on digital technology. To support the operation of the huge meta universe, we must first have extremely powerful computing power and algorithm.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The foundation of computing power is the chip. What about the algorithm? It is not only software, but also long-term talent accumulation and ecological management. People gather firewood and the flame is high. Only more talents join and invest more resources can we build the yuan universe brick by brick.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Virtual reality technology, game technology and AI Artificial Intelligence all belong to the category of it. From the perspective of CT communication, the meta universe also has a huge space for development. When it comes to the ""anytime, anywhere"" attribute of the meta universe, without communication and 5g / 6G / all-optical network with low delay, users cannot access the meta universe. It can be said that communication is the space-time tunnel for human beings to the future meta universe world.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, I think blockchain technology is more important. What is the relationship between blockchain and metauniverse? As mentioned earlier, metauniverse needs financial system and virtual pass. Behind the virtual pass is decentralized blockchain technology. Moreover, I think this is the catalyst and fuel to promote the early realization of metauniverse. Without blockchain digital technology, the concept of metauniverse is equivalent to a vehicle without power system. It is difficult to imagine how to drive on the road.**

A friend of mine got a few of us into crypto, according to him it is the future and the whole shabang (just like any other crypto bro will tell you)

He got into crypto a little before us and made a decent profit during early 2021. So we all gathered what we could and started investing. But the amount was too low. So I decided to take a loan from my sister who does commission artworks. She saved up about 700 dollars (which is a massive amount of money here) by working hard for a long time which she was saving up for a new laptop.

So long story short I invested all that and everything else I saved up into some shit coins (Ada , matic, doge, eth etc).
The entire time that crypto bro friend been peer pressuring us into buying more and more. 
And then the crash happens, lose more than half the money, panic, buy at higher price, lose again, cycle continues till I have nothing.

1651647338,1,1,"Hi there, I'm a veteran game devleoper. I've worked in the industry for 15 years on a mix of AAA titles, but mostly mobile games.

A couple months ago I decided to quit to try and create my own game studio with my wife as a 2 person team. Our primary goal is to launch Crypto Dungeon, a match 3 game validated on chain with NFT heroes and gameplay similar to Puzzles and Dragons. In the meanwhile, however, to help us get there, I took the past few days to hack away at a much smaller project with the hopes we could get a little traction ahead of time.

Double Up is a quick hack-a-thon project inspired by a pyramid scheme (so many tokens with reflection and reward systems are) but then transformed into a fair odds game with simple and transparent rules.

https://cryptodungeon.online/double\_up.php

200% to 300% gains on your entry \~42% chance to win!

Easier to enter than tracking endless shitcoin launch windows and hoping you aren't immediately rugged pre-launch.

This is not for the regal top 100 crypto currency token or coin investors. This is basically for the degenerates who might buy ShibTokenRug54, but instead of having a 1% chance to double your Polygon and a 99% chance you get rugged by unscrupulous developers stealing liquidity this is a simple gaming interface that can last forever. The code is easy to read and verify there is nothing untoward going on.

We take a 4% cut which goes directly towards funding Crypto Dungeon, our serious game we're trying to focus on and we have the initial entry spot which we will put towards our future token launch to support the game.

Instructions on how to play: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=7lnNuZ2-Wqg](https://youtube.com/watch?v=7lnNuZ2-Wqg)

Our goal with this project launch is simple: we want a reason for people to come hit our site and come back to us, we'd also like to raise a little liquidity to help us properly advertise Crypto Dungeon which we plan on launching soon.

Thank you for your time, hope to see a few new faces in our Telegram and/or Discord (links at the bottom of our website)! It's really hard to stand out as a small indie team when there are a ton of actual scammers and bots spamming 24/7, but we're real people trying to make something new, and while Double Up is a small project, we're proud to have launched our first fully functioning blockchain game on Polygon! :)",CryptoCurrency,"Crypto Dungeon, Double Up: just launched on Polygon!"

My portfolio consists of 50% BTC, 40% ETH, and 10% BUSD. Not the most impressive portfolio, some even called it the pussiest one, but I'm happy with it.

So back to the topic, what can you do to minimise your losses and survive the bear market?

# Reading &amp; Studying

***""Knowledge has power. It controls access to opportunity and advancement.""***

I have no idea whose quote is this, but it's such a well said one. I was forced to read and study certain projects at first just because I needed to understand the fundamentals. As time goes by, I no longer read and study as a **NEED**. I **WANT** to understand the fundamentals of projects. This has led me to more whitepapers, more articles and hence, more knowledge in my head. So, you should probably spend some time investing in knowledge.

# Staking / Earning

I can't emphasize how important this is. If you are not staking or lending your coins, you're missing out on a lot of returns. I have both BTC and ETH on Celsius earning 6.5% and 6.0% APY, and BUSD on Binance earning 10% APY. Depending on your risk appetite, you can opt for Defi options, which offer much better rates. Of course, the final decision is up to you, it's okay too if you decided to just HODL.

# HODL

Okay, this might sound obvious, but HODL is one of the skillsets that beginners lack. When I first started crypto I was so tempted to sell on a 5% loss. Today, not even a 30% loss would make me flinch, because deep inside I believe my coins would eventually climb back up. So yeah, if you truly believe in the future of your coins/projects, hold for your dear life.

# P2E

As a P2E player myself, I agree that most P2Es in the market right now are not properly developed in terms of tokenomics and game mechanics.

Ive been wondering, I dont fully understand how the whole Terra and TerraUSD work, but I understand TerraUSD is backed by Terra somehow.

How does that work? 

What will happen if the marketcap of TerraUSD is higher than that of Terra?


Do I understand correctly that the 18,5 bln of TerraUSD is backend by Terra value + about 2,5 Mrd in Btc that the Terra Foundation bought up?

This is an extract directly copied from their TOU last updated as of 19th November 2021 and accurate as of today. My understanding of (2) is that they are under no obligation towards the user's desired success, in other words the ROI stated on their website. 

I am a bit confused as the next point on then goes to say they are under obligation if it occurs due to negligence, loss of profits etc.

These seem to conflict with each other, I think? Wanted some advice as this is some crypto program that promises insane ROI (a skim revealed something like 50% on a certain package, would need to look over it again). My mother got into one of these schemes, specifically, Praetorian Group International or abbreviated to PGI, last year and got scammed (big surprise, I literally told her it was a scam from the outset, down ¬£5k) when they stopped paying ROI's then later shutdown. 

Would like some definitive proof (or at least a point in a direction) that could 'prove' (who knows maybe I am wrong 1 out of 100 times) this to a particularly stubborn parent who gaslights me whenever i try to stop these kind of behaviours.

1. A lot of people buy high-end hardware for mining, which indirectly creates a lot of demand for computer components. Therefore, employment opportunities increase in the semiconductor industry. 

2. Many central and decentralised exchanges are coming forward to provide their services for crypto trading, which increases employment opportunities for computer scientists. 

3. During the war or natural disasters people would lose their money if that was in Banks. If they had it in their wallet, they would never lose their money until they have their seed phrase. This is one of the best use cases of crypto. 

4. Many people are considering that people are losing their life savings in crypto. By the way, the same thing happens with stocks also right. One loose money and another gets profited.

5. Crypto transactions require less amount of energy than that transaction processed by Banks, which means crypto is eco-friendly.

If you have under $10,000-25,000 with [@CelsiusNetwork](https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork)(or any crypto exchange that has frozen your funds), here is a step by step guide on how to get your money back ahead of everyone else using the law:  


1. As of right now, these exchanges have not yet filed for bankruptcy protection. Therefore, they are subject to small claims court judgements.   Small claims court cases typically take 1-2 months. As long as this drags on longer than that, this strategy will work.  


2. To file a small claims lawsuit, the first step is to send a demand letter.  The demand letter should say 1) how much you are owed 2) why you think you are owed the money.   For Celsius specifically, you should mail it (return receipt requested) to: 121 River Street, PH05, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA",CryptoCurrency,Here is a thread on how you MAY get your money back from Celisius if it is under $25k but you have to act quick!

1656054201,0,1,"If you are wondering why Tether keeps trading at 0.9990 USDT/USD and does not drop further for long, it's because this is the price point where you can buy and redeem USDT directly at [tether.io](https://tether.io) for USD at a 1:1 ratio.

Tether charges the [greater of $1000 or 0.1%](https://tether.to/en/fees/) for redeeming directly, so assuming you buy $10m worth of USDT at $0.9990 the math looks as follows.

* Buy $10M worth of tether at 0.9990 and receive $10,010,010 USDT.
* Redeem on [tether.io](https://tether.io) and pay 0.1% = $10,010,010\*0.1% = $10,010
* Receive $10,010,010 - $10,010 = $10m on your bank account.

Naturally you also have to factor in the fees that exchanges charge you for trading, but as the largest users of USDT are exchanges themself, it should not greatly impact the price.

In short the fair market value of a Tether is $0.9990, not $1 and that's what the market is trading it at. Any price above $0.9990 can only be assumed to be market manipulation or purchases by [greater fools](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp).

This also explains why USDC stays at around $1, as you can redeem these for [USD with no fees](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc).

With this knowlage in hand, it should be safe to assume that most Tether traded for any price below 0.9990 will be redeemed and such transactions should be considered removal of liquidity from the Tether organization.

Prices below 0.9990 also represents an arbitrage opportunity for the exchanges themself. If USDT is traded at below 0.9990, the obvious thing to do, is to simply buy these tokens themself and redeem them directly at [tether.io](https://tether.io) for a guaranteed profit. As this does not seem to happen indicates that either:

1. The Exchanges and Tether are in bed together.
2. The Exchanges do not believe that they will be able to redeem USDT for USD at volume.

Unless Tether can find a set of greater fools soon, the liquidation pressure at 0.9990 will result in Tether falling over when they run out of liquid assets.

It's possible that this has already happened, but nobody is talking about it, while offloading their USDT to greater fools who think they are getting a great price at 0.998x.

In short, if you are holding USDT in the hopes that it will return to $1. Good luck to you!",CryptoCurrency,Why Tether should never trade above 0.9990
1656053643,0,1,"Hello all,

Just a quick question as I am just curious as to how CFD exchanges especially in crypto makes money (other than fees) or not lose any?

From my knowledge, since the exchange do not buy the underlying asset the customers are trading (eg customer buy bitcoin CFD) and when the customer close at a huge profit at a higher/lower BTC price, the exchange have to provide the profit from their own pocket?

Or does the exchange actually buy the asset itself and buy/sell based on what the customers are trading with the contract? But then by this, they are only merely earning the fees.",CryptoCurrency,How does CFD Crypto Exchange make money?

Well the question is pretty straight forward. Not here to spread FUD. I have never been more excited with the prices we are getting. Although my portfolio is down +70%. I have moved almost everything in BTC and ETH. both at 48% and 4% in alts, who went just so low I'm not even selling. The last few days I've been watching at how the market developed. And my feeling is we are not even close to the bottom. I'm one of those people who always wanted to buy bitcoin back in the days, but never did. Then we bought a house and there was no fiat for other things. Now I'm finally settled I started doing what I always wanted. And I feel this is the chance of a lifetime to accumulate and make up with all those lost years.

But when I zoom out on the situation there are some things that look different. I know this is something that is easily said, and something that every bearmarket get mentioned. But if you look closely this looks like a macro economic perfect storm for a great depression; Inflation at it's highest, pandemic (THAT IS STILL NOT OVER BTW), War in the most economic developed center of the world: Europe.

My question: How will BTC and ETH hold up in this climate. The reason why I ask this question is because I was planning on moving all in on ETH from now on. As it was my guess that I would probably make more money out of it on the middle-long term then on BTC. But with the prices now I'm not really sure. And I'm starting to doubt myself.",CryptoCurrency,How would BTC and ETH hold up in a full blown great depression

**TLDR**:  Crypto company Celsius has started the process of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Their lawyers notified US regulators on Wednesday. They claim to have 167 million cash at hand to support operations in the meantime. The reason for filing for bankruptcy was suffering losses due to exposure to the now defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. A judge in New York bankruptcy court froze 3AC's remaining assets this week and the fund is now in the process of liquidation.  Celsius was one of the largest players in the crypto lending space with more than $8 billion in loans to clients, and almost $12 billion in assets under management as of May.¬†Celsius said it had 1.7 million customers as of June and was competing with its interest-bearing accounts and yields as high as 17%.",CryptoCurrency,Embattled crypto lender Celsius files for bankruptcy protection

1658818672,0,1,"Perpetual swap is a kind of derivative similar to a future contract. The major difference of perpetual swap compared to a future contract is that it does not have an expiration date and therefore need no delivery. This directly brings two advantages. 

First of all, a perpetual swap trader can hold a contract much longer and technically face less liquidation possibility because no delivery will be forced. And a trader can hold the contract long enough to wait for the price to change until he or she turns loss into profit if the trader can manage the margin and leverage properly. 

Moreover, perpetual swap can waive a trader from re-establishing long or short positions constantly like what they do when the future contracts expire. This will save the traders not only energy but also actual money because losses may occur during moving positions. This is especially welcomed by traders who are frequent derivative traders. 

In addition to the above advantages, another major difference between perpetual swap and a future contract is that the price of perpetual swap is anchored to the price of the spot market given perpetual swap requires no delivery hence having no contract price. 

Perpetual swap adopts a funding rate mechanism to make sure the price of perpetual swap is anchored to the spot market price. The funding rate mechanism incentivizes or decentivizes long and short positions by charging them a certain fee in order to achieve the balance of the price.",CryptoCurrency,What is perpetual swap?

I don't think, contrary to a lot of belief, that BTC is designed to be a decentralized currency to replace USD. I think its best use case is as an asset, like gold was before it, to back the currencies that already exist. The reason economic disparity is so prevalent is the way the Keynesian Economic model works and how it drives inflation production, price and wages. When you have fiat currencies backed by nothing, there is nothing to stop the unlimited creation of it to solve financial problems.

Is there anybody that somewhat agrees with this? I think that if BTC was only meant to be pushed to topple the US Dollar as the driver of the World's economy, it wouldn't work too well, much like the guy who bought Papa John's pizza with it. It would be much more effective and revolutionary if utilized as an asset that backs currency not a currency itself.

# Nexo Credit Card

This is the only true crypto credit card available, when you make a transaction Nexo generates a loan using the crypto stored on their platform. Loans can then be paid off once the transaction has cleared.

There are no staking requirements, but Nexo operates a loyalty scheme whereby you loyalty level is derived from the percentage of your balance which is made up of Nexo tokens (Ethereum blockchain token). At least 1% is silver, 5% is gold tier and over 10% is platinum, the top tier. Frankly I think it‚Äôs only worth using the card if you‚Äôre platinum. 

Requirements for the physical card are minimum balance of $500 and platinum status, my physical card was delivered in under a week. You can also get a digital only card with a minimum balance of $50 regardless of loyalty level. 

## Pros

1. You borrow against crypto rather than selling it and preloading it on your card. This could be a tax efficient way of spending and it also gives you access to a line of credit without requiring any credit checks. 

2. Cashback in Nexo tokens or Bitcoin. I don‚Äôt think Bitcoin is worth it, but I guess it‚Äôs nice to have the option. 

Loyalty | Nexo | Bitcoin
Platinum | 2% | 0.5%
Gold | 1% | 0.3%
Silver | 0.7% | 0.2%
Base | 0.5% | 0.1%

You can keep your cashback on the platform where it will earn interest, or you can sell it on the Nexo exchange, withdraw it, use it to pay off your card, whatever you like. 

3. Apply/Google pay available, no FX fees on first ‚Ç¨20k per month, 10 free cash withdrawals up to ‚Ç¨10k total each month. 

4. It‚Äôs possible to borrow at 0% if you‚Äôre on platinum and 1.9% if you‚Äôre gold by using a Loan to Value (LTV) or 20%. This means for every $1 you spend on the card you‚Äôll need $5 as collateral. Note you can pay off your debt and free up your collateral as soon as the transaction has cleared, usually 1-5 days. 

5. Simple, free fiat on/off ramp using SEPA/FPS with minimums of ‚Ç¨10/¬£10 (note their website says minimum of ‚Ç¨1000, but it‚Äôs wrong). 

## Cons

1.  The whole platform works in USD, even the loans that are generated when you make purchases in EUR/GBP are in USD (strange considering the card isn‚Äôt available in the US). This means you are exposed to FX risk. For example you make a purchase of ¬£10, which generates a loan $12.00, then when it clears 5 days later due to an exchange rate change you have to pay ¬£10.20 to clear the $12.50 loan. This can of course work to your advantage too, but recently the dollar has outperformed euros and sterling. 

2. The collateral used for your borrowing doesn‚Äôt earn any yield, with the exception of Nexo tokens (one of their main utilities). This is further complicated by the mechanism Nexo uses to determine which asset to use as collateral, which is apparently at random an may select high interest baring coins like DOT before lower interest coins like Bitcoin. You can pre select assets by moving them into a credit wallet, but then they earn no interest even when they‚Äôre not used as collateral (again except Nexo tokens). 

3. You can use any coins/tokens which are in fixed terms as collateral. This means if you‚Äôve locked up Nexo tokens in a 12 month fixed term, then they‚Äôre useless for you card until that term ends. 

4. You can‚Äôt use fiat as collateral and while stablecoins carry a very generous 70% LTV, you can only use them as 50% of your total collateral. 

# Conclusion 

Each of these cards have different pros and cons and the best one for you may be different to the best card for me. This is only a top level overview so do your own deep dive before getting one of these for yourself. In general all of these cards are better than what Amex or high street banks are offering so they are well worth looking into.",CryptoCurrency,Crypto card summary - A European perspective

The growing size of blockchains poses a huge threat to the decentralization of the networks when the size gets too big for most of the nodes to store the entire chain. One approach to this problem would be to use contract-based persistence, where nodes hold a piece of the data and enter into agreements in which they are compelled to keep running the node for a certain period. However, these contracts provide weak protection against the risk of data loss since the party may not hold their obligation for any reason. In this paper, we propose a new approach for storing blockchain data that works under the premise that the risk of data loss in a peer-to-peer storage network (where all data is not replicated in every node) increases with the amount of time the data stays in a node. Following this premise, the protocol would work by treating nodes as ephemeral storage locations of data in motion.",CryptoCurrency,Stroma: A Novel Approach to Distributed Storage for Blockchain Data

&gt;**The Roman empire is probably the best example because it's so unique in its time. It's much bigger than anything that existed at its time, but if you look at the Byzantine empire, \[...\] and the Ottoman empire, and a bunch of others, all of them follow the same arc, and** ***we're*** **following the same arc. It's the arc of money.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**- Amaury S√©chet**, **founder of eCash**

Throughout human history, we have witnessed the same cycle play out over and over again. A civilization arises, forming an economy built on sound money that can't be printed out of thin air, and then as the population and economy grows, the society inevitably transitions to using a form of debt-based money.

This happens because while typical forms of hard money like gold or silver can be excellent at being a good store of value, they are not so convenient to use as a medium of exchange. This is why some form of debt-based money becomes necessary. Money that is both easy to carry around as well as easy to divide into smaller denominations.

Initially this transition to a better medium of exchange can have a positive impact on an economy. There is much less friction when it comes to transactions, and better liquidity leads to increased trade and improved market dynamics.

But there is a tradeoff. Such a system has always required a central authority that backs the value of this debt based money. And inevitably what happens is that at one point or another, the central authority will find itself in trouble, and resort to printing money out of thin air hoping to make their problems go away. This then leads to higher inflation, prices go through the roof, until the entire economy eventually collapses, people go hungry, and the civilization falls apart.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The great invention of crypto that very few people are talking about, \[...\] the truly groundbreaking innovation that Satoshi Nakamoto made is that it provided us a tool that has good hard money properties and good medium of exchange properties.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
**- Amaury S√©chet**

What makes cryptocurrencies so revolutionary is directly related to what Amaury calls the arc of money, because crypto finally gives us a way to break the same cycle humans have undergone for centuries. As a species, there's no doubt we are shaped by the technologies we have at our disposal, but one technology we almost never think of as a technology, while potentially being the most important one of all, is the technology we call money.

Maybe the reason we rarely think of money as technology is because it hasn't changed in such a long time. Sure we might have gone from using dollar bills, to credit cards, to Venmo and Apple Pay, but the underlying money we make our payments with has pretty much remained the same. Money that gets issued by a central government, led by people who at any time can act as a central point of failure.

Every form of money humans have ever used has suffered from these same limitations. We either had hard money that acted as a good store of value, or debt-based money that acted as a good medium of exchange, but never both. And if you think the US dollar has been good at both, take one look at how much a dollar purchased thirty years ago compared to today.

But what if we could have a new form of money that could do what no other money has done before? What kind of world could we build if we no longer had to deal with the normal boom and bust cycles usually associated with the arc of money? Well, that's exactly what I hope crypto can help us find out. For the first time we have a technology that has the potential to act as an excellent store of value as well as the best medium of exchange the world has ever seen. A technology that allows us to no longer have to rely on governments to run our monetary systems by replacing it with one that is trustless and decentralized.

But there's still a long way to go before crypto can claim such things. For now it's still mainly used for speculation, and while I hesitate to say crypto can survive without the speculators, I believe it will only thrive when the amount of people using crypto exceeds the number of people merely speculating on its value.

Because in addition to being a good store of value and medium of exchange, there is a third property that must be fulfilled in order for something to be considered a good form of money, and that's as a unit of account.

Just as it's impractical to pay for things in gold, it would be impractical to price goods and services in something that undergoes significant changes in value from one day to the next. But that is exactly how cryptocurrencies behave at the moment, and the underlying reason is because there are way more people speculating on crypto rather than using crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""People that use crypto as money have a stabilizing effect on the ecosystem. People that use crypto as a speculating vehicle have an amplifying effect on the price variation.""**  
**- Amaury S√©chet**

To expand on the above, think about the miners and traders who earn revenues in crypto but have to pay their bills and taxes in fiat currencies. When prices rise, these individuals benefit by having to sell less of their crypto to cover expenses, causing less supply to hit the market, resulting in even higher prices. But when the demand drops and prices go down, these same people are forced to sell more of their crypto to pay their bills, causing supply to go up and prices to drop even further.

On the other hand, people using crypto as money have the opposite effect. Rather than amplifying price movements, they have a stabilizing effect on the price. Because for people using crypto as money, when the value of their holdings go up, they will feel wealthier and want to spend more, not less. But if the purchasing power of their crypto falls, they will feel poorer and tend to reduce spending until the situation changes.

This is why in order for crypto to succeed, we need more people using it as money rather than merely speculating on it. People who leverage the technology not just to create new online casinos or ponzi schemes, but to build innovative new businesses, experiment with new governance models, and help to create more value in the world than we ever thought possible.

That's how crypto becomes the lifeboat.",CryptoCurrency,The Lifeboat: Part 2

## Like his viewpoint on Dogecoin, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has his own method of assessing the prospects of cryptocurrency initiatives.

¬†He views blockchains as networks with the potential for growth due to smart contracts. Cuban recently invested in blockchain firm Polygon as part of his search for technologies like Ethereum, which among other things can carry out smart contracts. Mark Cuban has reaffirmed his belief in Dogecoin as a platform with the capacity to run applications.

The Belief Mark Cuban Has In Dogecoin

The multibillionaire investor claimed that initiatives like Cardano did not take advantage of chances in an interview with Altcoin Daily. When compared to Dogecoin, he claimed Cardano had a better chance of developing into an application platform. Prior to Dogecoin actually developing into a platform for applications, Cardano had more potential, according to Mark Cuban. He continued by saying that Cardano was not found to have the most widely used applications.

Cuban emphasised that there are more apps available on the DOGE blockchain than there are on Cardano. Cuban favours Dogecoin despite the huge market capitalizations of cryptocurrencies like DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) The advantage of blockchains for the millionaire is their ability to draw more applications. He claimed that commerce is still king, even with cryptocurrency.

""The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they may improve businesses. It produces new business venture prospects. However, there must be a business and a utility for cryptocurrency. Cuban advised prospective cryptocurrency buyers to consider where users are spending the tokens in their daily lives.

Comparing daily prices, DOGE, SHIB, and ADA all increased. At the time of writing, the prices of DOGE and SHIB have increased by 3.91 and 4.9 percent, respectively, over the previous 24 hours. In contrast, the price of ADA is currently trading at $0.5422, up 4.35 percent from 24-hour rates.",CryptoCurrency,"More optimistic than this cryptocurrency, Mark Cuban is about Dogecoin."

However, some people (including myself) are taking advantage of the cashback opportunities provided by cryptocurrency and crypto cards. I understand that only a small percentage of the population is involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain, but why are all those who are already involved not using cryptocurrency for payment?

I have two friends who are involved in the crypto space. One of them isn't interested in that, he only building up a portfolio for the next bull run.. Another friend does not even hold crypto, he is a  day trader who is uninterested in anything else...   

I, on the other hand, am slowly building up my portfolio for the next bull run (because I believe we are still far from the bottom) and taking advantage of crypto payments and their cash back. I don't see why I  shouldn't add some passive income while I'm spending. It's not a lot of money, but I earn 30-35e per month with a 1.5% rate of cashback per transaction.

I could  buy a house and get cashback using the HOLD app/card. Let's hope that's a story to tell in future threads...

Anyways, no matter how rich or how poor you will be. It is normal to always fear losing value in any investment. And to stop worrying about it is next to impossible. Like if you aren't worried about it, then it most likely isn't an investment to start with. At least an investment with any meaning behind it.

So the less is, be smart and try to remind yourself on why you made that investment. Remind yourself your exit strategy. Remind yourself your limits. Set alerts to let you know if something changes within a range.

* ***Growth came amid huge expansion across the globe, CNBC said in a report citing leaked documents.***
* ***Despite crypto winter, FTX has looked to add to its growing portfolio of companies.***

FTX saw its revenue grow more than 1000% in 2021 as the massive bull market that took Bitcoin to highs of $69,000 pushed the cryptocurrency exchange‚Äôs revenue from below $90 million in 2020 to over $1 billion last year.

A CNBC [report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/20/ftx-grew-revenue-1000percent-during-the-crypto-craze-leaked-financials.html), citing leaked audited documents, revealed that the company, led by CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, generated the huge revenue amid a growing footprint built on crucial acquisitions.

**FTX‚Äôs revenue hit $1.02 billion**

In 2021, as rallying markets pulled in new money and helped crypto business establish a foothold following the previous market cycle, FTX emerged as one of those that took full advantage.

Financial success only helped to fuel global expansion for the company, adding to the overall revenue growth year-over-year, per documents the publication cited. Indeed, FTX‚Äôs revenue reportedly jumped from $89 million in 2020 to $1.02 billion in 2021 ‚Äì reflecting an increase of more than 1000%.

The crypto exchange also saw its net income rise significantly ‚Äì while in the previous year it stood at around $17 million, the crypto craze helped push that to $388 million. The company‚Äôs operating income went up from $14 million in 2020 to over $272 million in 2021.

Documents also showed FTX had cash holdings of nearly $2.5 billion at the end of 2022, with 27% profit margins.

I‚Äôd like to friendly remind you all that we need to be extra cautious as the ETH merge has made scammers extra active.

Yesterday, for example, a lot of us received a fake email from Ledger to update the Ledger Live app via a sketchy link.

Of course, we can undermine most of these efforts by exercising basic privacy hygiene. Don‚Äôt share your portfolio, seed phrase, address, and don‚Äôt forget: nobody knows your email address other than big exchanges, like Binance and Kraken &amp; even they will try to contact you through their own platforms. And most importantly, ignore the busty chicks in your DM. He is not interested in love.

Some of us use MetaMask or TrustWallet to access and beloved coins/tokens and we also use it to interact with other dapp‚Äôs and DEXs. This in particular is very interesting for scammers that use dust attacks to gain access to your funds. Basically, they airdrop a token that seems to have some monetary value. This incentivizes the victim to interact with the scammer‚Äôs DEX and this is how they gain access to your wallet.

What can you do about it? If you‚Äôre on MetaMask, you can easily take the following steps to guarantee your safety and disconnect your wallet from a dapp.

Go to the MetaMask wallet app &gt; settings &gt; security &amp; privacy &gt; clear privacy data

Go to the MetaMask Chrome extension &gt; Within the Account view, click on the 3 dots button on the top right-hand corner &gt; In the expanded menu, click on Connected Sites &gt; Click on the trash can button next to any sites you wish to disconnect from

If you use TrustWallet, you can follow the next steps:

Go to TrustWallet app &gt; click on settings &gt; click on WalletConnect &gt; this will give you an overview of the dapps you‚Äôre connected with &gt; click on dapp to get the option to disconnect!

It's bad enough losing your funds in a hack due to poor security but the team at OptFi (no of course you haven't heard of them they're on Solana) have gone and outdone the rest of the hastily put together defi space by completely bricking their own platform and losing approximately $661k worth of USDC.  


Whilst it's definitely not the worst loss we've seen this year, it's certainly one of the dumbest the timeline as follows:
  
[https://twitter.com/OptifiLabs/status/1564367455220219904](https://twitter.com/OptifiLabs/status/1564367455220219904)

&gt; On 29th August around 06:00 UTC, we had an update to our program code, and our deployer tried to upgrade the OptiFi program on Solana mainnet. However the deployer accidentally used the solana close program command, resulting in our OptiFi program being shut down. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Without fully understanding the impact, we used 'solana close program' and the OptiFi program on mainnet was closed, and cannot be recovered anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; 661k USDC is locked in the PDAs, luckily 95% of the fund is from our team member 3. We will compensate for all users‚Äô funds 

  
Defi strikes again. Without knowing what the ""close program"" command did on Solana mainnet the devs managed to completely brick their own platform so if you were ever wondering if you're qualified to work in the defi space the answer is probably yes provided you can read and know how to do a rudimentary search before copy pasting.",CryptoCurrency,"Solana defi exchange ""OptFi"" accidentally bricks itself - Loses access to all funds forever."

Hi, I currently have 6 cryptos in my portfolio: btc,eth,link,matic,enj,dot and I want to add one or two more and I cant choose the best ones out of this three: Avax,Near or algo. Because I dont know which one of them has the most utility as layer 1 blockchain and which one of then will diversify my crypto portfolio even more so I would like to add one or two out of the three to my portfolio so Which one would you choose and why?

1662621803,0,1,"I have been following the Ripple SEC lawsuit for quite a while and one of the main bones of contention in the lawsuit is that there is no expectation of increase in price in XRP if the company RIPPLE does well.

I have seen the SECs expert witness TRIES to make the statistically significant assumption that it is. The expert is terrible though and wrong with a lot of his stats but that's another story (I'm a PhD in biostats).

Now onto what I have a problem with. I see countless people on here, discord and twitter all saying that the SEC are crazy and there is no correlation between good news for ripple and price increase in XRP and then in the next sentence literally says once the lawsuit between XRP/ripple is over XRP is going to moon. 

There is no end to the shadiness in the SEC and I do want Ripple to win after all that has come out so far in discovery but that has nothing to do with my question here.

So what am I missing here?

I have an extensive background in shit coins and I dragged my bloodied corpse out of that game a while ago but I know a shit coin when I see one.  

When Luna was trading for 100 bucks a coin there was something like 300 million coins in circulation but now there is over 7 trillion coins in circulation. I know the degen urge to buy this is strong with some people but they‚Äôd have to burn a ton of the supply to have a hope in hell of reaching even 1 dollar. 

The only coin I‚Äôm in profit on right now is the mangled corpse of a rugged coin that I put a few bucks into for the lols right after it tanked and that‚Äôs the most crypto thing ever. I‚Äôm not even surprised tbh.

&gt;At a legislative council meeting addressing the amendment in July, May Chan, deputy secretary for Hong Kong‚Äôs Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, said that the administration was ‚Äúmindful of the need to maintain a balance between regulation and healthy development‚Äù of the virtual asset market.

1571128899,0,2,"The years 2017-18 gave rise to almost 4000 ICO‚Äôs in the crypto sphere. But, like the dot-com bubble, the ICO bubble also met the same fate. The year 2017-18 witnessed almost 4000 ICO‚Äôs in its making. These ICOS‚Äôs collectively raised close to $20 billion dollars from crowdfunding and venture capitalists. However, these promising ICO‚Äôs failed either due to strict government regulations or were a poor attempt to scam people for their money. After the crypto‚Äôs ICO bloodbath, rates of new coins, as well as promotional funds allocated to ICO‚Äôs, have been declined drastically. The ICO industry, with its scams, lost people‚Äôs money, and trust.

Following this massive spiral, ICO‚Äôs have become a thing of the past. The crypto industry has shifted winds towards a new mechanism of IEO‚Äôs. According to this blockchain and crypto report, in the first quarter of 2019, IEO projects raised $1.63 billion more as compared to other tokenized blockchain platforms. The beginning of 2019 marked an increasing shift towards one of the fastest capital funding platform of IEO‚Äôs.

Here are some of the things you need to know about IEO today!

1573900227,0,1," As part of our ongoing integration efforts into the [Samsung blockchain ecosystem](https://twitter.com/beniaminmincu/status/1191472313771802624) and in tandem with requirements from several exchanges, the ERD token needs to have an ERC-20 representation.

For compliance ahead of our mainnet launch, and thus ahead of the subsequent direct integration of our mainnet native token, we decided to burn 500.000.000 ERD tokens on the Binance Chain and mint the exact same amount on Ethereum.

Following these actions, the ERD token total supply stays unchanged, at 20 billion (20.000.000.000), and the ERD token circulating supply stays unchanged, at 8,084,166,667, representing 40.42% of the total supply.

In order to provide the necessary integration details to our ecosystem partners, the ERC-20 tokens have been minted early, with the following details:

**Token name**: ERD

**Token contract**: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xF9986D445ceD31882377b5D6a5F58EaEa72288c3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF9986D445ceD31882377b5D6a5F58EaEa72288c3)

**Contract creation transaction**: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x75a78b14cef51547898368edc8704a5ecf77212a0368910a8177eb885e90f85e](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x75a78b14cef51547898368edc8704a5ecf77212a0368910a8177eb885e90f85e)

**Total ERC-20 supply:** 500.000.000 ERD

Following the respective integration plans and communication schedules, we are now at liberty to announce this change, together with the corresponding BEP-2 token burn, details below:

[https://explorer.binance.org/tx/14336AD54320CC25420D2A7C7AFB58A03A5252F6225D9D5B6AC96D57310AD0EC](https://explorer.binance.org/tx/14336AD54320CC25420D2A7C7AFB58A03A5252F6225D9D5B6AC96D57310AD0EC)

Binance will soon enable Elrond deposits &amp; withdrawals to ERC-20 wallets.

Blockchain is a core enabler for the new distributed economy ‚Äî a layer of transparent and fair financial &amp; technological mechanisms that will replace their centralized counterparts by offering the exact same functionality, but in a trustless manner.

Trusting a third party is replaced by mathematical proofs generated by the very fabric of any distributed layer ‚Äî its network of computers. Participating with computing resources in a blockchain is one of the many ways of earning money in the new distributed economy.

At Elrond, we strive to lower the barrier of entry for our validators so that basic computer skills and entry-level PCs are sufficient to join our network and earn ERD rewards. We however want to make sure that even Elrond supporters without the time or resources to set up their own nodes can put their favorite cryptocurrency to work for them.

We are therefore happy to announce that Everstake will run Elrond validators on behalf of anyone interested in their Staking-as-a-Service offering.

&gt;*‚ÄúParticipants in the Elrond network are our core focus, regardless of their available resources or skills. By joining forces with Everstake we are now able to recommend a trustworthy professional blockchain infrastructure operator to all our supporters that need one.‚Äù said* ***Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO***  
*‚ÄúOur job as a staking service is larger than just validating transactions and generating blocks. We commit our resources to sustain the long-term well-being of the networks where we operate. Therefore, our selection process is rigorous. It includes due diligence on technology, economics, and business appliances. Elrond meets all our criteria, and we are happy to join the network as a validator.‚Äù* *said* ***Sergii Vasylchuk, CEO and Founder of Everstake****.*

Some call it DIVI celebration, others call it DIVI Dance. This signifies the moment when DIVI Masternode holders receive their rewards from the cloud mining of their DIVI masternode. DIVI masternode comes with a one-click feature often referred to as Masternode One-Click Cloud Installer (MOCCI) which makes the setup of the DIVI Masternode simple and easy among the others. The five tiers of the DIVI masternode which goes in a rank of Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond are made in such a way that every person of any economic or income status can afford one. The rewards can be added on to achieve a higher tier masternode if the holder aspires of higher tier anyway. 

The returns from the DIVI Gold masternode is about 35% which is about $4K a year and for different people, this can mean an active income or passive income which can support in settling some utility bills, organizing the vacation, paying school fees etc. 

Join the DIVI Dance and celebrate your masternode returns with me. Visit [https://diviproject.org](https://diviproject.org) and [t.me/diviproject](https://t.me/diviproject) for further information on DIVI Masternode.",CryptoCurrencies,The Dance for DIVI Masternode Users

1576057439,3,1,"Although decentralized exchanges, regarded as the [future of crypto exchanges](https://kucoinblog.com/are-decentralized-exchanges-the-future-sk-rd), provide considerable advantages over a centralized one in terms of anonymity, security and freedom from censorship, the latter dominates the crypto space in terms of volume of trading. In addition to the trading volume, DEX also suffers from low liquidity that is not favorable for market participants on board. Moreover, it cant be ignored that the challenge facing decentralized exchanges adoption at this stage is simply usability compared to centralized exchanges.

Despite the technology slacking to pick up the pace, there may be some kind of hope for the industry to be able to enhance safety and high liquidity in one place. Over the past few months, exchanges like KuCoin have been seeking innovative cooperation that could give their crypto trading platform an edge over the competition. Despite the impediments, KuCoin still managed to add an essential pillar that could herald their future exchange. KuCoin, one of the leading crypto trading platforms of 2019, had acquired Arwen.

The announcement is a significant technological advance for the industry, as the protocols of Ethereum and Bitcoin are commonly contradictory. Arwen uses novel smart contracts that make the impossible feasible across incompatible blockchains. It introduced a new trading alternative compounded with the benefits of liquidity from KuCoin with the security from DEX. It was a hybrid form of collaborative effort which created the best of centralized and decentralized solutions while also creating a new standard for secure trading and centralized crypto exchanges. Perhaps, a small step for KuCoin and Arwen can be a huge step for the industry.",CryptoCurrencies,The Best Of Centralized And Decentralized Trading

1580637812,0,1," For now, choosing the Lightning Network seems to be the right path. After the Lightning Network launched the Bitmain network, it has indeed achieved very low-cost instant payment, which is being adopted by more and more merchants.

This article is divided into four parts to introduce the past, present, future and detailed principles of Lightning Network in detail.

First, the lightning torch movement; Second, the current status of the lightning network; Third, the development history of the lightning network; Fourth, the detailed explanation of the lightning network principle.

**I. Lightning Torch Movement**

A lightning network reward relay is in full swing among Twitter users. This viral campaign is now known as the Lightning Torch Campaign. Just like the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign on social media in 2016, this caused a lot of spread and attention on the Lightning Network.

On January 20, 2019, twitter user [u/hodlnaut](https://www.reddit.com/u/hodlnaut/) tweeted that he sent 100,000 Satoshi (100k satoshis, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshi) to the first selected user through the lightning network rewards application tippin.me, An additional 10,000 users will be issued to the next user. And so on, until the last user is unwilling to add another 10,000 Satoshi and take the bitcoin accumulated by the previous owner as his own, the game is over.

Hodlnaut wanted to see how many Satoshi the reward relay game would end.

Enthusiastic netizens have specially created a website to track in real time which Twitter user the lightning torch has reached. According to the website information, as of press time, there have been 215 users participating in the delivery, and recently one person needs to send 3.15 million Satoshi Bitcoins. The cumulative total of Bitcoin sent has reached 4.56 BTC.

If no one actively terminates the game, the torch transfer will automatically end when more than 0.168 bitcoins are passed. Because the current maximum capacity of the Lightning Network payment channel is set at about 0.168 Bitcoin. Developers are currently developing to increase the capacity of payment channels.

Many celebrities in the digital currency industry have participated in the delivery of the lightning torch, including Andreas Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek, Roger Ver, Bitcoin Jesus, Joost Jager, Lightning Lab engineer, and Zhao Changpeng, founder of Binance , Tron founder Sun Yuchen, Twitter founder and square CEO Jack, BitMEX Research.

Hodlnaut, the initiator of the Lightning Torch, has ordered a Tesla to promote Musk's participation in this event.

Tippin.me developer Sergio Abril said that the Google Chrome extension for Tippin.me has been released on February 17. After installing the extension, a Lightning Network reward button will be displayed under each tweet, which can directly reward twitter users. But you need to open Tippin.me first, otherwise it will show that this user does not exist.

 The picture below is a screenshot of someone giving a tweet to the golden financial reporter on February 20th.

&amp;#x200B;

At present, the lightning torch is only available among twitter users, and you can log in to tippin.me with a twitter account and create lightning network invoice information (invoice). Twitter and tippin.me are closely related because Twitter CEO is one of Tippin's investors.

**Status of Lightning Network**

Lightning Network has grown rapidly since October 2018.

According to the 1ml data of Lightning Web Browser, as of press time, Lightning Network has 6,473 nodes, a total of 28,783 payment channels, and a total network channel capacity of 708.34 Bitcoins. Both the payment channel and the total network capacity have increased by nearly 30% within 30 days.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

![img](od1gyelighe41)

 

It is worth noting that another layer of the 1ml name means that the goal of Lightning Network is to reach 1 million Lightning Network nodes, which currently only achieves 0.6% of the goal.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](m8skpbbkghe41)

 

According to p2sh.info statistics, the capacity of Lightning Network Channel is more than 8 times of half a year ago, and 157 times of a year ago. Golden Finance estimates that at the current growth rate of 30% per month, the lightning network capacity can reach 10,000 BTC in 10 months, and the lightning network capacity can reach 100,000 BTC in 19 months.

On February 11, Twitter, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark participated in the Stephan Livera podcast. Jack announced that the Lightning Network was not a question of integration into the Square Cash App, but a question of when to integrate.

Because of the low-cost (or even no-service) small-amount instant payment feature, Lightning Network Payment has been integrated into various applications such as sports event prediction, betting, knowledge payment, rewards, and payment on behalf of others. These integrated apps are called Lapps.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](5xfdc9xmghe41)

 

Y'alls is a paid reading website that uses the Lightning Network to pay, and paying a small amount of bitcoin can read the articles inside the website's pay wall.

Zigzag is an exchange that can exchange other cryptocurrencies to Lightning Network Bitcoins at a low cost and high speed, or exchange Lightning Network Bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies.

Australian cryptocurrency payment gateway livingroomofsatoshi provides various services such as payment of credit cards, bank bills, and rent with the Lightning Network.

Satoshi's place, similar to EOS Pixel Master, people can spend a bit of smart Bitcoin to occupy pixels in the picture. The gold financial reporter spent 1890 Satoshi writing the word ""golden"" in the lower right corner of the canvas (red circled in the figure below).

&amp;#x200B;

![img](7838e5bpghe41)

 

Competition is fierce, as of press time, pixels have been covered by other users

Event prediction and sports betting website microbet.fun currently provides event prediction and betting functions for four sports: football, rugby, basketball and ice hockey. NBA, Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and other famous sports leagues are predicting the bet list.¬†

Golden Financial reporters tried several Lapps and found that Lightning Network truly achieved at least two of its stated goals: extremely low fees and instant payment. In terms of fees, several payments initiated by Golden Financial reporters have no fees, and the amount can be as low as 1 Satoshi. In terms of payment speed, it is indeed within seconds. The payment experience is not lost to Visa.

There are currently several Lightning Network clients, the three most popular of which are Lightning Labs' Ind (Lightning Network Daemon, Go implementation), ACINQ's eclair (Scala implementation), and Blockstream's c-lightning (C implementation).

Lightning Network gives users / merchants a great deal of freedom. Any user / merchant can set up their own Lightning Network node by themselves, and can directly use third-party node services such as lightninginabox and Casa Node to own the node out of the box, as well as open source third-party payment services, such as the open source project lndhub, BTCPayServer sets up nodes and develops wallets for users to use your nodes, and everyone can open a bank freely. In terms of wallets, similar to Ethereum's Metamask wallet, Lightning Network also has Google's extended wallet Lightning Joule, as well as light wallets provided by third parties and ToB payment service providers such as OpenNode and Lightning Network POS system NanoPos.

How does Lightning Network achieve the fast payment experience? Bitcoin analyst JP Thor research pointed out that because the layer-2 lightning network payment does not need to go through a third-party intermediary, the payment between two points can be as fast as the TCP / IP connection, so the lightning network payment speed will exceed Visa. At present, the processing speed of a channel of Lightning Network can exceed 250TPS, and there is no upper limit for network expansion. Visa's current payment peak is 50,000 tps, with an average value of about 24,000 tps. Bitcoin's processing speed is only 7 tps.

In this way, real-time payment is truly realized, and the vision of the Bitcoin white paper cash payment function becomes a reality.

**Third, the development of Lightning Network**

The prototype of the Lightning Network can be traced back to the first version of Bitcoin software Bitcoin 0.1 released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin 0.1 includes a draft of the original code, allowing users to update transactions before they are broadcast on the blockchain to confirm transactions. This may be the prototype of the payment channel concept. Satoshi Nakamoto explained in detail to how the payment channel will work in a personal communication with the then Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn.

In 2014, Alex Akselrod proposed a two-way payment channel, and he is now an engineer at Lightning Labs.

Prior to the publication of the 2015 Lightning Network White Paper, in order to address the Bitcoin scalability vulnerability, PeterTodd designed and implemented a new type of time lock timelock, CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) in the Bitcoin protocol.

In February 2015, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon published a Lightning Network white paper-Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable off-chain instant payment. That same month, they elaborated on their ideas in public for the first time at a Bitcoin developer seminar in San Francisco.

For almost a whole year in 2015, the Bitcoin community focused on issues such as Bitcoin expansion and block size issues. Two expansion conferences: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal in September, and Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong in December.

Soon after the Hong Kong Expansion Conference, Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed a Bitcoin expansion roadmap in the Bitcoin-development mailing list. This roadmap includes the Lightning Network. This roadmap has the support of most Bitcoin technology communities and became the Bitcoin Core roadmap.

In May 2015, the blockchain development company Blockstream hired Russell, the core Linux developer, and hoped that he would implement the Lightning Network in C: C-Lightning.

In January 2016, two authors of Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja, and Elizabeth Stark and Olaoluwa ‚ÄúLaolu‚Äù Osuntokun co-founded a new company LightningLabs to develop the Lightning Network. LightningLabs will develop lnd in Go language.

In October 2016, the third Bitcoin expansion conference was held in Milan. A few days after the meeting, the main developers of Lightning Networks such as ACINQ, Amiko Pay, BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse held their first LightningSummit. This conference discussed how to make all different Lightning Networks compatible and interoperable with each other, and form the Lightning Network Protocol Specification BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology). BOLT became the basic specification of Lightning Network.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lightning Network white paper is incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol and requires some protocol upgrades to Bitcoin. CLTV time lock requires that the payment channel be closed regularly, and the use of relative time lock Lightning Network will perform better. In the summer of 2016, the Bitcoin network implemented a soft fork upgrade called CheckSequenceVerify (CSV).

Before Segregated Witness is activated, Lightning Network based on Segregated Witness is continuously tested. In May 2016, the fourth version of Blockstream segregated witnessed the ""SegNet 4"" Lightning Network c-lightning test online. In October of that year, Christian Decker of Blockstream purchased a photo of a cat from his colleague Rusty Russell on the testnet, which is considered to be the first breakthrough of the Lightning Network.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ufwj6izsghe41)

 

In January 2017, lnd released an alpha version. More and more developers are starting to develop various applications based on Lightning Network, including desktop, mobile wallets, small knowledge payment platforms, gaming, browsers, and other Lapp applications.

In August 2017, Segregated Witness was activated, and obstacles to the deployment of Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet were cleared.

In November 2017, Blockstream first announced that the beta version of the c-lightning Lightning Network was launched on the Bitcoin mainnet and completed the first transaction. Then, Lightning Labs announced that Lightning Network completed the first cross-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

In December 2017, Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ announced that the three implementations of Lightning Network are compatible with interoperability.

Although the Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet is still in beta, users can't wait to trade with real Bitcoin.

In December 2017, Lightning Network ushered in its first transaction. Lightning network developer Alex Bosworth and payer Bitrefill established a payment channel and paid their phone bills with Bitcoin.

In January 2018, Lazlo Hanyecz, a legend in Bitcoin history, announced that he had successfully purchased pizza again through the Lightning Network. Lazlo Hanyecz was famous for buying pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins.

In March 2018, Lightning Lab released the ind beta version and received a $ 2.5 million seed round investment including the twitter CEO.

Since then, nodes, wallets, payments, and applications have been continuously developed, and merchants and services connected to the Lightning Network have continued to increase, and the Lightning Network has begun to explode.

**Interpretation of the working principle of Lightning Network**

This part is a hard core understanding of Lightning Network, mainly from the Lightning Network White Paper by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon.

To understand the Lightning Network, you need to understand several concepts: 1. Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO); 2. Multi-signature; 3. Two-way payment channels; 4. RSMC ‚Äî Revocable sequential expiry contracts Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract, 5) HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**1.Unspent transaction output UTXO**

The Bitcoin model is not a common account model, but uses unspent transaction output UTXO. Except for mining rewards, there are no inputs and only outputs, and all other Bitcoin transactions have corresponding inputs and outputs.

UTXO specifies the number of Bitcoins that can be spent and the owner. You can only spend Bitcoins at this address if you prove that you are the owner. Prove that you are the owner by unlocking a ""ScriptPubKey"" which is stored in a field in ""Output"". When UTXO is spent and used as the ""input"" of a transaction, a ""ScriptSig"" needs to be provided, and the ""Unlock Script"" and ""Lock Script"" are combined to run. The verification is successful. Allowed and generate new ""output"".

We use the famous digital currency Alice, Bob, Carol transfer to illustrate.

Assuming Alice transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, the ""output"" of this transfer transaction will be set as the following ""lock script"":

&gt;OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The effect of this lock script is that if you can't prove that you are Bob, you can't spend 0.5 BTC.

When Bob wants to transfer the money from Alice to Carol, Bitcoin will first find the UTXO from Alice, then create a new transaction and generate the ""output"" of this new transaction. This output also contains ""Lockdown Script"" for Carol. At the same time, an ""unlock script"" is generated in the input of this transaction, and it is arranged by &lt;Bob digital signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt;. Then broadcast the transaction into the memory pool and wait for the miner to verify that Bob's transaction is legal and not spent.

The specific method for the miner to verify is to take out the ""unlock script"" in the ""input"" of this transaction and run it together with the ""lock script"" in UTXO that Alice transferred to Bob. The specific form is as follows:

&gt;&lt;Bob signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt; OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG

The verification steps are as follows: 1. Take out the &lt;Bob signature&gt; and push it onto the stack; 2. Take out the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it onto the stack, and now the &lt;Bob public key&gt; is on the top of the stack; 3. OP\_DUP copies the &lt; Bob public key&gt;; 4, HASH160 instruction to hash the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it into the stack, and now at the top of the stack is the hash value of Bob public key; 4. Take out the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; And push it into the stack, where the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; comes from the output of the previous transaction; 5. EQUALVERIFY instruction: take out the two public key hashes at the top of the stack and continue if they are equal, otherwise the verification fails 6. CHECKSIG instruction: Take out &lt;Bob public key&gt; and &lt;Bob signature&gt; for signature verification. If it is true, the transaction is legal.

In the above example, a private key unlocks the corresponding UTXO, also called a pay-to-pubkey hash (P2PKH, Pay To PubKey Hash). For asset security and transaction expansion, Bitcoin also has multi-signature technology. Multi-signature requires multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO.

**2.Multi-signature technology**

The technology that uses multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO is called multi-signature technology. The general form of multi-signature is M-of-N multi-signature. There are N public keys (2 &lt;N‚â§15) in the ""lock script"". A digital signature generated by at least M private keys is required to unlock UTXO.

Multi-signature technology only relies on the OP\_CHECKMULTISIG instruction to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. This instruction reads the M signatures and N public keys and the M and N values, and then uses the public keys to verify the signatures in sequence, and the successful matching counter is incremented by one. Finally, the counter is equal to M and the operation is successful.

The following uses 2-of-3 multi-signature as an example.

Lock script in the 2-of-3 case:

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

Assuming that only private key 1 and private key 3 are used, the unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt;

The composite instruction is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

Run successfully.

However, the multi-signature lock script uses all public keys, and the amount of data is too large, which will increase transaction costs. So now multi-signature uses a payment to Script Hash P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) transaction, introduces a Redeem Script concept, and moves N public key information from the lock script to the unlock script.

The locking script in the new scheme has become concise:

&gt;OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

The hash of the redemption script here is only 160 bits, or 20 bytes, which is much shorter than the previous N public keys.

Original text of ""Redemption Script"":

&gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

The unlock script is:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt;

Synthetic instructions:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL

Based on the characteristics of the stack, this instruction first performs a hash operation on &lt;Redemption Script&gt;, and then compares with &lt;Hash of Redemption Script&gt;. If the original script is run like this:

&gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG

**3.Two-way payment channel**

With the understanding of multi-signature technology, the first step of Lightning Network is easy to understand. The Lightning Network interacts with the Bitcoin network through a payment channel. Users first establish a two-way payment channel, and the core transfers the user's Bitcoin to a multi-signature address. This is called Funding Tx in the Lightning Network white paper.

We also take Alice and Bob as examples. If Alice buys breakfast or coffee from Bob every day, they only need to pre-store a part of their money in a third-party common account. After each transaction, the two parties agree to update their account allocation. The transactions between them are paid on Lightning Network. The peer-to-peer expansion in the channel (also known as the Commitment Transaction Commitment Tx), the whole network broadcast is not on the chain, and the peer-to-peer instant payment is truly achieved. Only after one party decides to stop using the other party's service and close the payment channel, the final channel status is broadcast on the Bitcoin network, and Alice and Bob unanimously sign the agreement and settle the chain. In theory, as long as the number of Bitcoins recharged when the payment channel is opened is sufficient, the number of transactions in the channel can be unlimited.

**The essence of the payment channel is that Alice and Bob transfer their bitcoins into a 2-of-2 multi-signature address.**

But how to prevent Alice or Bob from cheating when closing the payment channel and not broadcasting the final status on the Bitcoin network? Lightning Network uses RSMC to ensure that both parties are honest and not cheating. If the payment channel is closed, the latest channel status is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

**4. RSMC-Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract**

The Lightning Network white paper page 19 describes how RSMC works:

If the user does not broadcast the latest channel status, it will be punished, and the other party will take all the funds in the channel. Because the funds of both parties are kept in RSMC, he has to wait for 1,000 blocks to confirm (Note: Timelock) before he can get the funds, while the other party has two signatures and he gets all the funds in the channel before him. If the user broadcasts the latest channel status, there will be no revocable transactions. After a period of time (1000 block confirmations), both parties to the transaction will get their own funds.

We also choose Alice and Bob to deposit 0.5 bitcoin each to a multi-signature address to open a payment channel as an example to illustrate how RSMC actually ensures that people pay honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](7iraontwghe41)

 

In the picture above, Alice and Bob are mirror-symmetric. It is enough to study one person clearly. Alice and Bob will create a Commitment Transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a and C1b, respectively.

Commitment transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a has two outputs, one is 0.5BTC in the RSMC address signed by Alice and Bob, and the other is 0.5BTC of Bob (output 1 in the figure).

Below C1a, there will be a Revocable Delivery Transaction (RD1a) and a Delivery Transcation (D1a). RD1a uses BTC in RSMC. Because RSMC is a multi-signature address, both Alice and Bob's signatures are required. The RD1a output is paid to Alice 0.5BTC, but only if the C1a transaction is broadcast and confirmed by 1000 blocks. D1a indicates that Bob can consume this 0.5BTC at will. As long as C1a is broadcast, Bob can immediately broadcast D1a to get 0.5BTC.

The essence of the final result of the whole mechanism is that if Alice wants to terminate the transaction with Bob, he can choose to broadcast C1a, Bob can get 0.5 BTC immediately, and Alice needs to confirm to get 0.5 BTC after 1000 blocks. The same is true for Bob.

Consider again the transaction between Alice and Bob. For example, Alice spends 0.1 BTC to buy a cup of coffee from Bob. Now the allocation of funds in the payment channel needs to be changed to Alice (0.4 BTC) and Bob (0.6 BTC). This requires two steps. One is to create a new committed transaction, and the other is to invalidate the previous transaction.

**Create new committed transaction**

Below is the left side of C1a and C1b (the RMC and subsequent transactions are omitted for the sake of illustration); the middle column is the new transaction created by Alice: C2a, RD2a, D2a; the rightmost column is the new transaction created by Bob: C2b, RD2b, D2b.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](0z612mwyghe41)

 

C2a and C1a have the same structure. From Alice's point of view, the number of BTC in the RSMC address that Alice and Bob sign together is 0.4 BTC, and Bob's is 0.6 BTC.

Bob will also create the corresponding C2b, RD2b and D2b, and then the two parties will exchange the promised transaction and the RSMC transaction to complete the signature, and the new transaction will take effect.

**Obsolete old commitment transactions**

At this time, the old and new transactions (C1a / C2a, C1b / C2b) exist simultaneously and are valid at the same time. How to abolish the old promise transaction?

Lightning Network abolishes the old committed transactions C1a and C1b through two methods: one is to exchange private keys between the two parties; the other is to create a ""Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a / BR1b)"" instead of the RSMC revocable transaction (RD1a / RD1b).

&amp;#x200B;

![img](iourbs72hhe41)

 

As shown in the figure above, the input of the new Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a) is 0.5BTC in the multi-signature RSMC, and the output is 0.5BTC paid to Bob.

Therefore, if Alice signs and broadcasts the old channel state C1a in violation, the funds in the Funding Tx multi-signature will be transferred to the multi-signature RSMC and Bob addresses, each 0.5 BTC. At the same time, in addition to owning the private key of 0.5BTC in RSMC, Bob also received Alice's private key, so Bob can broadcast BR1a to the entire network. The RD1a created by Alice needs to wait for another 1,000 block confirmations to take effect. In this way, Bob has all the funds in the payment channel.

The multi-signature RSMC firstly delays the acquisition of funds by the person who closed the payment channel, and secondly, it can provide economic incentives to invalidate the old transaction without cheating, because broadcasting the channel status of the old transaction will have penalties, and the Bitcoin in the payment channel will be fully Be owned by the other party.

Through this mechanism, it is ensured that Alice will not broadcast C1a, and C1a will naturally become invalid.

Subsequent new commitment transactions D, E, F in the payment channel are also processed according to the above process, ensuring that Alice and Bob always broadcast according to the latest channel status when they want to close the payment channel.

The above discussion is the payment process of Alice and Bob, which cannot be turned into a lightning **network** . If there is no direct payment channel between two nodes, they can be indirectly connected through other nodes to form a lightning network. The payment between them is called Multihop payments.

The Lightning Network can make multi-hop payment between nodes through HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract.

**5. HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract**

&amp;#x200B;

![img](i6kudwh5hhe41)

 

What if Alice wants to pay Dave 0.1 BTC, but there is no direct payment channel between them? Dave will generate a random number R as a secret, and then send the hash value of R to Alice. Alice will tell Bob: If you tell me the preimage of H within three days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Bob tells Carol in the same way: If you tell me H's preimage within two days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Carol can tell Dave the same thing, but time is within a day. And Dave does know R.

Remember the case where someone gave a reward to a golden reporter via tippin.me? At the beginning of preparing this article, the golden financial reporter experienced Lightning Network Payment with Lightning Network Wallet, and transferred 1000 Satoshi to his tippin.me. In fact, there are multi-hop payments in this process. The golden financial reporter's wallet was jumped to tippin.me through Indhub.

The above is the overall picture of multi-hop payment. Let's take a look at the specific transaction between Alice and Bob. In multi-hop payment, although Alice and Bob use the established payment channel between them, the transaction between them is not the same as direct transaction, and HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract is introduced.

Through the detailed explanation of Lightning Network above, the essence of Lightning Network is to link the nodes into a network through a payment channel, and then use the mechanism design and technical methods of RSMC, HTLC and other methods to avoid the moral hazard of the counterparty in the payment channel, so as to avoid the need to trust the other party and For third-party point-to-point payment, because there is no need to go online, the bottleneck of payment speed lies in the speed limit of the network, so it can be paid instantly.

According to the characteristics of the Lightning Network, such as payment channels and multi-hop payments, although the Lightning Network now basically achieves the user experience of instant payment at very low fees, there are also some problems, such as the centralization of payment channels, liquidity, and payment collection. People online, routing, etc.

**Conclusion**

Looking back at the development of Bitcoin and Lightning Network, maybe Bitcoin as a value storage currency and payment currency do not conflict at the same time. Bitcoin acts as a clearing network and Lightning Network acts as a payment network.

The widespread use of payment functions will increase the transaction volume of the Bitcoin clearing network, increase the transaction fee of the Bitcoin network, and increase the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Positive feedback makes each other.

The only problem left is the problem of large price fluctuations. Lightning Network payment is based on Satoshi. If the price of Bitcoin is high enough, its volatility may be low enough to become a daily payment tool.

Bitcoin investor Tim Draper recently stated that the world will use Bitcoin to buy coffee in two years, and by 2023 baristas will laugh at those who are trying to buy coffee in fiat currencies.

Maybe one day this will come true.

pi is a relatively new crypto with a new mining protocol that makes it really easy for anyone to mine on their smartphone app. it appears to be a timer that just accrues pi over time, and you just have to tap on it every day to make sure a person is mining it.

since it's just a timer based mining, the resource used on the phone is virtually none.

they already have over 2 million (I think? ) miners and increasing. Last time i checked, the mining will go to 0 when the user number reaches 1 billion.

at that number, or well before that, it will easily be the biggest user base in crypto history.

so they basically solved two problems with their platform. the mining gear/cost/difficulty issue and the user base/adoption issue.

what are your thoughts on this? I think it can be the biggest thing in crypto.

you have to have a referral code if you want to check it out. you cannot join without a referral. mine is https://minepi.com/seank",CryptoCurrencies,[xpost] what are your thoughts on new crypto pi?

**Cryptocurrencies** are designed around the idea of no central bodies being in a total, centralized control and many of us would prefer that no amount of our crypto profits goes to the taxman. However, having **clear taxation rules** might be beneficial for the industry, **legitimizing** digital coins as a viable **alternative** to traditional money, essentially making taxes a necessary cost of doing business.¬†¬†

**The reality** is that the rules are often ambiguous and how **Bitcoin** and Co. are treated greatly differs from one country to another. With the tax season being in full force, we have decided to dig in deep and delve into the **crypto tax state** across thirteen **European countries**. **The Bitvalex crypto tax guide** will shed light on the share of profits their residents need to forego to their governments. Some countries have decided to treat **trading cryptocurrencies** and holding them for the long run differently, some don't, and some, surprisingly, are **true tax havens** for the crypto winners! 

**Countries That Treat Trading and Investment**https://bitvalex.com/article/the-best-european-crypto-tax-guidehttps://bitvalex.com/article/the-best-european-crypto-tax-guide **the Same**

Let's start with **Estonia**. It is considered one of the most open-minded countries with forward-looking cryptocurrency legislation. Currently, cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are regarded as property and your profits from selling them (the amount you received from the sale minus the amount you paid to obtain the cryptocurrencies) are subject to personal income tax at **a 20% flat rate**. Your losses, unfortunately, can't be declared and thus **you bear 100% of the risk**.

In **Bulgaria**, the government also doesn't differentiate between short- and long-term investment. If you realize a profit in a specific year from selling your Bitcoins, you are subject to **a flat 10% capital gains tax**, the same as if you were trading financial assets. The good news is that **your losses will thus decrease your taxable gains**.

In its present state, DeFi developments are still nascent platforms, but this has not hindered their ability to attract millions in deposits. This makes exploitations, even non-technical ones, rewarding for abusers. 

The greater problem here, though, is bZx team's incompetency at handling disastrous events and absolute disregard for users' funds. 

Not only did they get hacked (twice within days), they also used their master key to try and revert some of the losses, making the concept of DeFi moot by showing to the public that their ""decentralized"" finance protocol is both unsafe and centralized. A key highlight for why developers should avoid self-managing their PR.

And I stupidly waited, thinking they would bounce back a bit as the overexcitement over the halving wore off a bit since the event is still 2 weeks away, and most people should know there'll probably be a little dip right afterwards before it shoots up to the stars (ETA at moon TBA). But no. Instead I'm seeing the dollar-value of my holdings increase but the amount of BTC I can trade back for it is plummeting, and I was hoping to hold BTC after the post-halving dip... Do I cut my losses (0.07 BTC at the moment, for chrissakes) and hodl BTC, or do I wait this out and hope XLM and LTC will trade better against BTC in the coming weeks (before the halving? After it when it dips a bit?). It's not really day-trading when you're sitting there stuck hodling coins for 2 weeks... But at this rate, they'll both be worth 0.0000001BTC before I know it.

1589533892,0,1,"I have never posted to reddit until now, but I was searching for information on here, or somewhere on the internet, to explain what I just witnessed. Please chime in if you are familiar with the actual live stream that aired last night, Chamath Palihapitiya, or Social Media censorship!

\----------------------

TL;DR: I wake up unexpectedly and go to my laptop to look up crypto news videos to hopefully lull me back into sleep and learn something simultaneously. I see a live stream w/ 12 or 14k watching Chamath Palihapitiya (from an unrefreshed browser on 05.14.2020, being viewed approx. 05.15.2020 4am US EST) discussing the bitcoin halving, supposedly BTC giveaways, and some other crap in the video header.¬†**I click.**¬†I get a message saying this:

This account has been terminated for a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service

I'm pissed because I value his information; I value CP's information because he comes across as someone with relevant information that doesn't try to sell you BS. Now, here I am on Reddit, trying to find answers from society (via reddit)!

\---------------------

So I'm developing a more serious interest in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space and one of the voices whose opinion I've grown to respect is Chamath Palihapitiya's. Besides his experience at FB, IMO, his investing perspective has the conservative judgment of the generation before mine (millennials; personally, I'm almost an 80's baby) with the youthful lens of awareness of relevant investments for our generation and the younger ones. I would expect all of this from someone who literally helped develop the infrastructure for the modern culture that dictates all the kids born post-9/11.

Furthermore, Chamath runs an investment fund (Social Capital) that isn't currently open to new investors, has already invested successfully in growing seed start-ups for acquisitions or independent successful operational growth, and he is barely in his 40s but already a freaking billionaire by net worth, likely through FB equity and a diversification of other assets, like the BTC he mentioned he owns and probably makes a shit-ton of money through commissions generated from lending his BTC to firms to market make (who are making money off the spread borrowing CP's BTC). Ok, that last part is complete speculation, so please fact check me - I heard him in an interview say that he has a large store of BTC that he is a long-term holder for and makes money off by lending to trading firms, but outside of that, I'm not sure if he has FB equity that is making him a billionaire, but it would make sense given his early role and leadership with the company.

I say all that to say this: WHY IN THE ENTIRE FUCK WOULD CHAMATH PALIHAPITIYA BE BANNED FOR ANY REASON?????¬†**ANY?**

I've seen him very selectively choose his language to express what he means and additionally, selectively choose his actions to only express the things he wants to express. I find it difficult to believe he would risk being banned or terminated on the YouTube platform for justified reasons...

I've seen a lot of questionable censorship stuff lately on the YouTube platform, more so related to the COVID, 5G, and related whistleblowers. I've seen a law enforcement officer and former IRAQ special Ops vet in Washington State (named G. Anderson) who just risked his career (and probably lost his job) for American freedoms because he believes law enforcement is literally becoming a tyranny akin with the Gestapo (from some guy named Papa Duck -¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_j8i-GXcqL4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j8i-GXcqL4)). I've seen countless nurses and doctors who've reported that their emergency hospital career experiences suggest that what is being called 'COVID' may be health symptoms being caused by other stimuli (also on said 'Papa Duck's' page - blame the YT algorithm for overloading his content to me because I liked that he references primary sources like nurses and doctors and police in his videos).

This level of censorship can only increase if it is tolerated, but I'm not sure if the people have any ready alternatives. First, is CP legitimately being censored or did he actually violated ToS and was terminated from his account for justified reasons?

Second, if he was censored, what did he say or do that was censorship-worthy? I feel like he is very straightforward, so maybe he said some thing that was 'too honest' and possibly went against the platform he was using?

Third, less of a question, way more of a statement: for any computer-programming aficionados or billionaire new-age investors - there is a MAJOR market for a DECENTRALIZED video platform or a NON-CENSORSHIP video streaming platform that hosts the content that isn't safe for YouTube. I've probably seen some of the most abominable violations of freedom of speech on Youtube within 2020 since I've ever been on the platform and I can only see this getting worse if the people tolerate this unchecked.

I don't know if these are red flags or not but things just got weird when he said to use copay and then things got even more weird when I found out copay barely exists and has been in beta for 3 years.

On December 17, 2017, Bitcoin reached a record high of $ 19,850. Behind it seems too crazy, it is the favor of more people.

Because prices rose too high, there were many people selling them, and then they plummeted. It has risen to USD 10,000 again at the beginning of the May, and the current price trend has stabilized.

For any new currency issuance, the previous increase cannot be estimated, some have increased by 5 times, some have increased by 10 times, or even 50 times, and more times, so it is necessary to buy coins early.

**07/05**

**AMA with Dominik Schiener &amp; David Sonstebo**

**davidsonstebo**

**IF is collaborating with a plethora of companies focused on crypto, as well as several crypto-projects that build solutions on top of DLT, for instance out-sourced computation.**

**davidsonstebo**

**We are in active dialog with numerous financial institutions regarding a myriad of new services and business models that the IOTA Tangle enables.The financial sector as a whole is undoubtedly a priority for us and fits like a glove due to IOTA's lack of fees.**

**domschiener**

**I think a lot of that really depends on how much testing is being done by the community over the**

**coming weeks.** **We have tentative timelines of releasing Nectar at the end of Q3, and Honey in Q1**

**2021.****The exciting part is that you - the community - can really play a role in this.**

**domschiener**

**re: Collaboration with other projects.**

**We are actively discussing this with other projects to really extend the functionality of IOTA (for example, anonymous transactions).****You'll hear more about that soon.**

**davidsonstebo**

**We will host a virtual SumSum in the fall,****we are currently planning different events etc. for this**

**domschiener**

**re: JLR Car eWallet.**

**We are still in close contact with them and are actually exploring use cases with them + other partners (for example energy providers). With corona, many of the timelines have sadly been delayed, but we expect this to improve soon.**

**domschiener**

**We are definitely speaking with other mobility companies as well, and are discussing close partnerships.In general, IOTA is the most established permissionless DLT when it comes to mobility, so we are excited to bring real products to the market, especially after Chrysalis**

**davidsonstebo**

**There will always be people who doubt,** **but mathematical proofs don't lie, nor does code; we let that speak for itself. Our team is certainly 100% confident.**

**davidsonstebo**

**For sure, I know some community members have looked into building it before;** **we really look forward to the 'cambrian explosion' that will follow from the network improvements and soon Smart Contract ability.**

**domschiener**

**re: implementing our solution.**

**I think one of the biggest problems which many DLT projects are not aware of is** **the whole problem around system integration. How do I productively integrate a technology like IOTA into my existing systems and create seamless interactions.**

**domschiener**

**We solve this problem by having years of experience working with large companies and understanding their needs. We also have many system integrators as partners (you can see them on our website) who are helping to close this gap.**

**domschiener**

**it's definitely one of the major hurdles for DLT and for IOTA to be productive, but** **we're on a good path especially because we take the industry's feedback into account and shape our engineering roadmap around that.**

**davidsonstebo**

**It's very hard for me to pick just one of those, those 8 are faaaar from exhaustive in terms of industries that IOTA can disrupt or improve. For brevity's sake:** **anything that involves data or transactions ought to involve IOTA**

**domschiener**

**re: migration with Chrysalis.**

**We are introducing breakign changes on the protocol, which means that users will have to change from the current signature / address scheme to the new one.But this will be as simple as issuing a transaction. Our wallet will do all the heavy lifting.**

**domschiener**

**re: tokenization standard.**

**Absolutely!** **We are already speaking with partners which token standards we can introduce when using the IOTA platform to tokenize your real estate, equity, mobility fleets, etc.**

**domschiener**

**standardization is an important part of all of our work, and we will keep that in mind with smart contracts and tokenization**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: partners feedback on Chrysalis and Pollen;**

**they are very enthused. A lot of them has been eagerly awaiting this before devoting more resources, as they naturally want to build on the real architecture**

**domschiener**

**re: standard by the end of the year.**

**Our entire engineering process has been improved by introducing a clear RFC and specification process.****You can already see this with Bee (I recommend you to look at the repo).** **Creating an official standard takes time though.**

**domschiener**

**re: regulations up ahead.**

**I think** **what really needs to happen more is****that the crypto industry and the tech experts** **start speaking more with the regulators.****I really hope that** **by engaging with INATBA and the Digital Chamber of Commerce that we can be a voice for the industry**

**domschiener**

**in particular questions around legal, tax, accounting and storage for dealing with crypto-currencies need to be clearly defined.**

**davidsonstebo**

**The time for ternary is not now, while the time for IOTA is most certainly \*now\*, so we adjusted our roadmap.By shifting to binary, we make IOTA a lot more efficient immediately due to the decades of legacy support for binary. It also makes the development faster.**

**domschiener**

**IOTA in 5 years will be an established digital infrastructure layer, which will be the backbone of an**

**enormous new economy (Machine Economy and beyond). Once the network is fully decentralized next week,** **we really expect a cambrian explosion of new IOTA DApps and products.**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: standardization.**

**I don't think any other project is as far along with their specification and standardization efforts as IOTA.****We consider it pivotal for world wide adoption.** **Collaboration with open source organizations, standard bodies and companies is our strategy**

**domschiener**

**Standardization certainly helps with adoption and it is key for certain industry applications (e.g. data interoperability).But we also are already seeing large companies being the pioneers of their industry and building the first products.**

**domschiener**

**after Coordicide there are some very exciting topics to look at, such as sharding and optimization of the new IOTA network.And then there's also applications on top of IOTA / DApps etc.****There will be enough work**

**domschiener**

**we truly envision IOTA to be the backbone of a new economy, powered by feeless microtransactions**

**davidsonstebo**

**re:** **AI + Tangle,**

**it was always embedded into the DNA of IOTA and there's numerous efforts by the community as well as ourselves in terms of research and potential.****Btw, CFB was never involved in introducing that to IOTA. I'm confident that this symbiosis will emerge naturally**

**domschiener**

**We do have an upper TPS limit today.** **The Chrysalis improvements which will come end of July will push the network beyond 1000 TPS stable on the mainnet. With Coordicide and sharding implemented, we don't see any upper limits.**

**domschiener**

**re: smart contract necessity.**

**We have definitely refined the scope of Smart Contracts to bring it to the market faster and drastically increase the use cases enabled by IOTA.We for example also have IOTA Access now,****which will be the future of access control for embedded devices**

**davidsonstebo**

**Oracles will emerge naturally. Given that IOTA is the perfect layer for immutable data, the two concepts are made for each other.**

**domschiener**

**re: cloud provider.**

**We're already talking with several cloud providers to integrate IOTA, so that companies and users can easily spin up nodes directly from the dashboard!**

**domschiener**

**re: most important thing from the community.**

**Get involved! IOTA is nothing without its amazing community and its ecosystem which is building around it. Especially now with the Pollen network, we need as much involvement and feedback from the community as possible.****We are truly creating this future of IOTA together.**

**domschiener**

**re: exchange listing payments.**

**Absolutely not, we have never played the Pay to Play game which others have.**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: funding of IF,**

**we have several different revenue streams. The iota reserve is still a significant part of covering costs, but by 2021 IF should be self-sustaining without relying on the tokens**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: regulatory concerns.**

**We decided from day 1 to go through the slow and steady (and much harder) route from day 1** **by incorporating the organization in Germany, this ethos is still embedded in the organization. We work with regulators all the time, so no big concern**

**domschiener**

**re: what's coming next for us.**

**1) A highly scalable and reliable mainnet, with less than 10 second confirmation times. 2) The continuation of the fully decentralized testnet with incentives paid out to the community, 3) more adoption not just in industry, but also DeFi etc.**

**domschiener**

**re: US vs. European partners.**

**Today I would say** **more than 70% of our partners are in the EU. Which is very exciting, as we haven't explored the US yet.We do have companies like Dell who we're working with, but over the coming months that will certainly increase! Same with Asia.**

**davidsonstebo**

**In the early days there was definitely a major focus on becoming the leading DLT in Europe, which I'd say we have succeeded with. In the last year we've gained a lot of US adoption as well and allocate more resources there. US adoption will certainly skyrocket soon**

**domschiener**

**Europe was an excellent testground for us to prove what the Foundation can do, what the possible use cases are, and for our technology to mature. In the next phase we are able to on board companies more quickly and work with them on clear products.**

**domschiener**

**Currently we have 110 team members in the Foundation.**

**domschiener**

**one word:** **DApps! We are already doing that now with the Pollen Testnet****(you can build DApps**

**there already), and** **this will only increase with Chrysalis (where we will have a Smart Scripting**

**Language) and Smart Contracts.**

**davidsonstebo**

**securing data and enabling m2m payments. We are already working with semiconductors such as ST Microelectronics on this**

**domschiener**

**I think one of the main things** **that is lacking in Germany is the involvement of the government. While we are in contact with the government, I think there is a lot more we can do (for example testbeds). I hope that will improve soon.**

**davidsonstebo**

**The Avalanche whitepaper is riddled with red flags and their leader is showing concerning behavior.****Not a fan, despite them copying some of our concepts, which is always a compliment**

**domschiener**

**re: specification.**

**We are nearly done with all the coordicide (Honey) specifications - including Mana. We are working on refining them now with Pollen and will publish them to the community soon**

**domschiener**

**The entire research team has been working on the specifications for the last months**

**domschiener**

**why not setup both nodes? Pollen and Hornet?** **Both of them don't require that much resources and will support the networks.If you want to test out what the future of IOTA looks like, you should definitely play around in the Pollen network.**

**domschiener**

**Hashgraph is definitely not a competitor, as they have a completely different business model (for profit) and network (permissioned).**

**domschiener**

**there is no requirement on the number of nodes - the more the better of course!**

**domschiener**

**We already have an integration with Hyperledger, and we are definitely pushing forward with interoperability(you will learn more about an exciting research project at the end of the month)**

**domschiener**

**Stronghold is the name of the wallet library, which will have strong cryptographic proofs and safety**

**(including hardware). It will be the backbone of the future IOTA wallet.**

**davidsonstebo**

**an addendum on the topic of misunderstood:** **A lot of uninformed individuals seem to hold this false belief that IOTA is ""purely experimental"", whereas in reality we have an army of professors, PhD and academic institutions working on every aspect of it.**

**domschiener**

**re: Q1 production readiness.**

**The exciting part about our strategy is that many of the Coordicide concepts are already being introduced to the IOTA mainnet with Chrysalis. Which means that the core software (Bee and Hornet) will be battle tested over the coming months.**

**domschiener**

**We expect to be fully ready in Q1. In fact, our big objective for this year is to make IOTA enterprise ready and meet the demands and requirements from the industry.**

**domschiener**

**re: Testbed in Africa.**

**It's definitely one of the most exciting projects in our history and it is continuing well! We expect to have a fully functional supply chain testbed setup there, and be part of the supply chain process.**

**domschiener**

**re: Trondheim.**

**The CityxChange program (funded by the European Commission) will continue until 2022 / 2023, we've already made some great progress and I think that more results will be shared soon. It's been awarded as a flagship project by the European Commission.**

**domschiener**

**We are 100% confident in Coordicide, and that we will be able to deliver**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: whether Coordicide can fail.**

**Not at all**

**domschiener**

**We sadly don't dictate when our partners can publish news - it really depends on them.** **We have**

**just started the new development (expansion) of the project some 4 - 6 weeks ago.**

**\[about Africa testbed\]**

**domschiener**

**Fiware: We just started a webinar series with some municipalities in Germany.** **With Chrysalis being finalized, we will definitely work on a full integration with Fiware, right now it is a bit too early.**

**domschiener**

**re: price correlation.**

**Sadly, this is a problem for all of crypto, since BTC is sort of the ""gateway"" to it all.** **I do hope that with more well established financial players entering the scene, that this dependency will diminish. But I sadly have no timeline in mind.**

**domschiener**

**re: incentives.**

**We will publish more on that soon. But** **you will be rewarded for finding bugs / attack vectors, and we will also distribute awards for participation.**

**davidsonstebo**

**re: incentivized testnet.**

**We are currently exploring some really exciting ways to setup rather ""game changing"" incentives,** **but regrettably I cannot disclose any details.**

**domschiener**

**we are not personally involved in development and coding (which is a good thing! lol). Purely**

**management / strategy.** **We have one of the best, most experienced and passionate teams in this**

**space, so I'm really happy to work alongside them.**

**davidsonstebo**

**Neither I or Dom are involved in the actual coding anymore. I'll just echo what Dom said:** **we have built a team comprised of the best of the best, so our role these days is to empower, support and guide them to the best of our ability**

**domschiener**

**we can't do pre-announcements haha. But** **we are working on exciting projects where you can actually use and earn IOTA tokens, real world cases with the industry, and some exciting extensions to IOTA's functionality beyond micropayments and data.**

**domschiener**

**I think** **the engineering department is around 35 - 40 people. Then there's around 15 researchers**

**domschiener**

**re: rewards for node operators.**

**There will be no intrinsic rewards in the protocol, but** **with the introduction of DApps you can be paid for example to store data from others, or to process information (Smart Contracts).**

**domschiener**

**I would say that it has a lot to do with integration time and cost.** **With Chrysalis, we think that this**

**will drastically improve and hopefully IOTA will be listed on some of the other large exchanges.**

**domschiener**

**I think** **in the future the IOTA Foundation will really establish itself as a ""think tank"" and leader on data privacy, monetization, digital trust and digital identity. We will continue to develop software, but we will also work more on advising governments and corporations.**

**domschiener**

**You will see many great improvements and use cases coming up over the coming weeks, so definitely stay tuned on our exciting progress!**

**domschiener**

**this is definitely the most exciting time in our history, and we and the community can truly feel the**

**progress and the impact which our work has.**",CryptoCurrencies,[AMA hosted by CMC(with Dom/David)] Readable Summary

While all the market attention has been in and around Bitcoin, investors need to look at some better and alternate options. The crypto market is currently buzzing with some once lesser-known altcoins.

Oracle service provider Chainlink (LINK) has been one of the top performing cryptocurrencies for 2020. Chainlink continues its massive rally in the crypto market surging more than 250% since the beginning of 2020.

Chainlink is one blockchain network that helps to solve one of the most pressing issues of the blockchain industry. The Chainlink oracles help to connect Ethereum-based smart contracts with off-chain data thereby establishing a bridge between off chain platforms and the blockchain network.

This has turned out as the most vital application as several businesses running decentralized applications like DeFi can have access to off-chain data and automate the entire process on a blockchain platform. With the recent [surge in DeFi](https://www.worldcoinindex.com/news/decentralized-finance-defi-on-a-rise-as-the-sector-sees-new-developments), the demand for Chainlink has been on a rise.

Two weeks back, Chainlink also entered a collaboration with China‚Äôs Blockchain Services Network (BSN) to help them with easy data transfer. Besides, Chainlink is making some important partnerships with other businesses and helping them with oracles services.

At press time, [Chainlink (LINK)](https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/chainlink) is trading at $7.32 with a market cap of $2.56 billion. Chainlink has climbed up the ranks to grab a spot in the fifteen most-valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap. Chainlink is witnessing a major surge in its daily trading volumes which has reached over $800 million.

Another smart contract token [Tezos (XTZ)](https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/tezos) has surged very fast in 2020 and is currently witnessing high daily trading volumes. Since the beginning of 2020, Tezos has surged over 90% and is currently trading at a price of $2.95 with a market cap of $1.95 billion. If Tezos manages to cross its major resistance of $3, it will further continue to surge from these levels.

[VeChain (VET)](https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/vechain) \- a blockchain-powered services that focuses on providing institutions with supply chain organization, financial services and smart contracts - is now in limelight. Many analysts call VeChain as one of the most-innovative blockchain networks in the market.

Recent industry reports suggest that VeChain might enter into a partnership with Ripple very soon. While it‚Äôs not confirmed yet, VeChain is seeing a good jump in its daily trading volumes.

At press time, VeChain (VET) is trading at a price of $0.017 with a market cap of $997 million and daily trading volumes at $1.36 million.

How long is the supply chain from the manufacturer to the end user? I think you can roughly understand that many products on the market have a very long chain before they fall into our hands. And at every stage there is a risk of fraud, substitution, and other unpleasant things that make the product worse for the end user and cause irreparable damage to the reputation of the manufacturer. Everyone knows about it, they fight as best they can, but the fakes have not gone away.

I know that blockchain projects have already tried to solve this problem, but have not really succeeded in this. Now the NEM team got down to business. With vast experience in this technology, they have developed a new Symbol blockchain capable of solving many business problems, including this one. The team has a name, knowledge of how to do it and certain connections. I think they will be successful. Symbol's main network launch is slated for the end of the year. 

More about the project.

VERSATILITY : Our OCTOPUS robots are all equipped with a common multipurpose base. This base has the function of a command post.

INTELLIGENCE : Our guidance technology is inspired of autonomous vehicles. 

PERFORMANCE : Our biosecurity robots outperform all competing solutions consisting of fixed installations or static equipment, even those that are supposedly mobile...

COMMUNICATION &amp; TRACEABILITY : A Wifi interface provides real-time monitoring of the various operating parameters. 

AUTONOMY : Our robots move by themselves and are powered by a long-lasting battery. 

SECURITY : Our OCTOPUS robots guarantee a maximum level of performance and safety (no human intervention is required).

It's unarguable that tasks can be automated to produce greater throughput and Octopus Robots ( octopusrobots.com ) take the lead in producing robots that are in demand and used in various industries.

Thats why i gave the two setup ideas for longs. We got a nice rejection on the moving average not once but twice. Entry on that support level of 11.4k and stop loss under previous days low and we still got over 1:2 R:R. TP smashed which is nice

1601365197,36,1,"***Nyan*** *has grown quite a bit over the last week.* 

&amp;#x200B;

We saw the bidding contract which allows the collective holders to decide which investment to bid on tested and it passed with flying colors. Some holders had a bit of a gripe over the fact that you needed some programming skills (Solidity) in order to place a bid, but my argument for that is with the investments relying on competent calls to transfer and interact with the correct contract, this bidding action is better off handled by a professional or someone with extensive experience to avoid any technical mistakes. I think the community will find solace in this down the road once the investment fund hits 7 figures. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to seeing bidding work on-chain, **we also got our first taste of voting on-chain with logo voting,** which resulted in ""*Weirds*"" ***Nyan*** logo being selected. Congrats!

&amp;#x200B;

[The new Nyan.finance Logo](https://preview.redd.it/5bu06ql6g1q51.jpg?width=470&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a656ca135b356d368c7eb2cdd6b0d56ed4a957e)

&amp;#x200B;

*Black Zero*, the developer and creator of ***Nyan.finance*** has made it clear the initial vote on what we will utilize as our first collective investment vehicle will be happening in the very near future. He stated they were aiming for sometime during the day on 9/28, *but this was pushed back to sometime today on 9/29*. This is where we will see ***Nyan*** realize its full potential. A successful investment is paramount to the projects success. One could argue a successful transfer of hedge funds to another token, whether financially successful or not, is setting the landscape for an entirely new way to invest in crypto. 

&amp;#x200B;

While development for ***Nyan*** has been heading in the upward direction, the opposite has happened with price. As you can see in the chart from *CoinGecko* below, the valuation of ***Nyan*** has dropped tremendously. 

&amp;#x200B;

[via CoinGecko](https://preview.redd.it/izmw0di9i1q51.png?width=1704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3fc857d7260d1f6816a8158111049129c23fa6d)

&amp;#x200B;

With the tokens valuation skyrocketing when news broke about the project, it has come down to earth while active development has taken place. There seems to be a floor of around **$76**, underlined with the blue line above (don't laugh at my crooked line!). Is this a good time to buy? Is this a sign of more price decrease? Will the valuation of ***Nyan*** be higher with the confirmation of a working product in comparison to a strictly speculation driven valuation? The only thing we can do is wait and see how the first investment goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Tomorrow could be a truly historic day in the world of decentralized finance.***

Do you know any decent freelancing platforms that accept cryptocurrency as a payment method?

The only one I found is SEOClerks, but the quality of the services provided by sellers is not that great and is mostly focused on SEO and selling backlinks. Also, most of them are not native English speakers.

Fiverr had accepted Bitcoin a few years ago, but unfortunately, they no longer allow it.

I found several other platforms that do accept cryptocurrency, but none had a good amount of sellers.

1605174827,2,1,"TrustToken, a stablecoin issuer, is allowing its proof of reserves system for TrueUSD (TUSD) collateralization levels on-chain. To add Chainlink to an existing partnership with Armanino, an accounting firm, makes it happen.¬†

The transparency move is designed for offering extra certainty to decentralized finance (DeFi) traders who usually depend on asset-backed stablecoins and don't know whether the assets are fully backed.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/8zq9h23b7sy51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f28f261dc3151d6d1cb0e0b79354f7c6f9e57509

Pulling from Armanino's TrustExplorer API, it allows the data to be available on-chain through the Chainlink integration, enabling app builders to develop preventative measures against fractional reserve banking or other potential risks.

Armanino's blockchain director Noah Buxton noted, ""One of the things that we think will be immediate will probably be on Aave ‚Äì they'll build-in risk circuit-breakers. They'll look at if the token is collateralized ‚Äì is it a stable stablecoin ‚Äì and then be able to build risk functionality around that.""

Rafael Cosman - CEO of TrustToken - stated that one of the problems that lending protocol Compound boasts in term of listing stablecoins is making sure that stablecoin issuers indeed have the ability to mint the coins and enable them to be properly decentralized.¬†

As per the data from CoinGecko, TUSD is the seventh-largest stablecoin with regard to market cap. June saw that the stablecoin was approved as a collateral asset to produce dai on the Maker lending protocol.[http://en.icointime.com/post/345106772658.html](http://en.icointime.com/post/345106772658.html)",CryptoCurrencies,TrustToken Is Bringing Proof of Reserves System for TrueUSD

1612253754,0,8,"All investments involve a degree of risk. There‚Äôs always a possibility of loss as well as profit. Before you decide to do anything, you need to understand how much risk you are comfortable with. This is known as your risk tolerance.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãIf you decide to begin exponentially growing your business, you will need risk tolerant capital. It could be $400‚Äì800 for smaller capital accounts and $1000‚Äì2000 larger capital accounts.
‚Äã‚ÄãFor exceptional returns, speculators could allocate a risk-tolerant capital investment of $2000‚Äì4000.

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãMost Network Effect participants should accumulate 1000 $PART position‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is the ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù standard for $PART STAKING (dividend like returns). As the Network Effect strengthens over time, the value of your holdings and also your interest rewards by staking will grow exponentially!


Particl Privacy Platform has a real use-case. It‚Äôs a decentralized, private-by-default, eCommerce application that has huge potential for mass adoption. 99% of all other digital assets (cryptocurrencies) DO NOT have anything similar. Most have only a speculative-currency use-case, which is already fulfilled by BITCOIN.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãMany Bitcoin holders will eventually end up accumulating PARTICL ($PART), due to its unique  global private decentralised eCommerce value proposition. What makes Particl second to Bitcoin is its supply which is also considered SCARCE. At the same time Particl is better than Bitcoin as Particl is Privacy and Anonymity oriented DECOM platform for Private Dapps. It‚Äôs a Big Bang in the cooking! 


Currently Less than 10,000 people on our planet of 7+ billion, could ever HOLD a 1,000 $PART position, since the current Particl supply is less than 10,000,000 PART.


‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúPARTICL is all BITCOIN ever wanted to be. BITCOIN is all PARTICL ever wanted to be.‚Äú - Particl is Satoshi Nakamoto dream come true 


‚Äã‚ÄãHypothetical Trade to Make: Buy Particl (PART)
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãAccumulation Price: any price up to ~$47 per 1PART is considered a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù price. 


Accumulate (buy slowly, scaling in), stake it and earn passive income on your position. AND REMEMBER, the $Part amount that you stake compound will grow exponentially too!
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãStop Loss: consider placing SL at 1.2x- 2x profit of your average accumulation price and up.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãBuy It On: Bittrex, Chainex or other exchanges where PARTICL $PART is available. 


Larger risk-tolerant accounts seeking a position should explore OTC options.


‚Äã‚ÄãStore It On: Particl Desktop or other wallets.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãImportant note: do not buy into the sell wall. Instead, setup a buy order on the buy side of the order book and wait until someone sells $PART to you. Buy slowly, sell slowly.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãSupport the decentralized Particl network by staking for passive income - compound. There is no minimum so you can stake whatever amount you have accumulated and are comfortable with. (Utilize the network‚Äôs SECURITY, PRIVACY &amp; Anonymity; PROSPERITY to ensure your safety.)
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãTo receive a constant stream of staking rewards, the recommended amount is 1000 $PART. A 1000 PART position would generate an approximate ~4% annual staking reward. That‚Äôs a monthly earning of 4 PART. The secret is compounding. 
‚Äã‚Äã 

‚Äã‚ÄãAlso remember, helping to grow the Particl Privacy Platform ‚Äúnetwork effect‚Äù and eCommerce activity will generate additional staking rewards from minimal fees paid out by increasing participants. The Big Bang of world trade without third parties! 
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãWhen will the Particl network‚Äôs value begin exponential growth? 


With 100X exponential growth, 1 PART could be valued $100 USD. So a position of 1000 PART could generate a passive income of $400 a month. If $PART value experiences an additional 10X growth from there to $1000 per 1 PART, that would equate a passive income of $4000 in STAKING REWARDS EACH MONTH! 


Of course you could scale out (slowly SELL position) over time taking profits whenever you need, want or EXIT your position completely. It is important to always consider taking some profits along the way, as a risk management strategy. At that point, it‚Äôd be up to you to decide what to do with your new-found wealth!
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãIs it worth it to take the risk?
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãDuring the BULL market, when cryptocurrency valuations were rising due only to absolute Greater Fool speculation, $PART value spiked to ~$47 USD, without any real world use. But after years of development, Particl has wisely positioned itself for the cryptocurrency BULL RUN (exponential price increase). 


Particl has a real, working product , with a quality and utility NEVER SEEN before in the Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency space!
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãHypothetical speculation puts Particl‚Äôs exponential market capitalization growth at $10,000,000,000 billion USD and over as it‚Äôs Satoshi Nakamoto dream coming true!


The value of 1 PART could spike beyond $1000 USD. That means if you had accumulated a 1000 PART position, your $Part value would experience growth to $1,000,000 USD! Not a bad risk vs return, speculative hypothesis for a $1‚Äì2 thousand investment.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãIf this seems unbelievable, then consider a return of 2000+% ,once $PART gets back to previous highs of $40-$50 range. If your average position entry price is $2, then that‚Äôs an exponential wealth generation of ~23.5X‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää34X. So your 1000 $PART position would grow to ~$40,000 -$50,000 wealth.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãCryptocurrency digital-asset markets move very fast. Today it‚Äôs a depressing BEAR market- tomorrow it‚Äôs a euphoria-filled BULL market. In green we trust! 
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãParticl‚Äôs Fundamental Technological value, should be ~$899 USD NOW!!! As its technological innovation is worthy of a position in cryptocurrency‚Äôs TOP 10 market cap, RIGHT NOW, AT THIS VERY MOMENT!
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãLet‚Äôs compare PARTICL with LITECOIN, currently ranked in the TOP 8th place with $8.74 billion market capitalization.


Litecoin has only one only speculative use case- a currency, which is a little faster than BITCOIN transactions. LOL. ‚ÄúMuch speed‚Äù the Bitcoin ‚ÄúSilver‚Äù. LOL. A meme to the moon. 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚Äã
Litecoin $8.74 billion USD market-cap is only justified by its NETWORK EFFECT (amount of trader speculators, holders, exchanges). So while you can still experience wealth growth with Litecoin, it‚Äôs already in the TOP 8 coinmarketcap position, which drastically limits its upside wealth-building potential. It‚Äôs only a boring high risk speculative digital currency with no privacy, anonymity or dapps... 
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãNow we understand what enormous value is hiding within the PARTICL PRIVACY PLATFORM, currently hovering around a $6 million marketcap.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãOnce PARTICL reaches LITECOIN‚Äôs marketcap of $8.74 Billion, 1 PART will be valued at the equivalent of $899 USD.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãIn Conclusion 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚Äã
Particl offers a Steve Jobs Apple grade mainstream use case, designed to create utility for the underlying $PART digital asset - Decom (decentralised commerce). 


This increasing demand will add to Particl‚Äôs network effect. As Particl becomes more popular, the platform is poised to grow into a TOP 10 contender within Crypto Industry. 


The only question is, are you going to get involved today in strengthening the Particl Platform and securing YOUR financial future?


There are over 2000 digital assets with different Fundamental and Technical value propositions. 


Particl digital asset offer the BEST Risk/Reward Ratio and the best potential for exponential growth based on respective fundamentals.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãParticl has one of the best FUNDAMENTAL and TECHNICAL offerings in the digital-asset market. It‚Äôs private by default Decentralised Dapp platform with first Private Marketplace dapp for global e-commerce trade without third parties. It works right now! And this creates a property designed to increase cash flow.

‚Äã‚ÄãCash flow is the money that is moving (flowing) in and out of the Particl Privacy Platform and its decentralized applications from Wealth Producing Activities. It is essentially a platform for global business, built into a permission-less and private format without third parties. This increase security, prosperity and wealth of all participants in the network.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãAll around our beautiful planet, businesses will be more than eager to accumulate $PART and use the Particl Privacy Platform e-commerce capacity for every day private and secure trade. Using Particl to gain a competitive advantage will become a natural, intellectual conclusion. As voluntary, permission-less participation grows within the community-driven network effect, so does direct wealth for businesses, customers, governments and every other participant in the OPEN network.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãUtility, and demand, for the PARTICL NETWORK are multi-dimensional. A GLOBAL NETWORK of businesses will emerge seeking to secure privacy, boost revenues and minimize transaction costs by accepting Particl‚Äôs underlying cryptocurrency: $PART.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãValue in any system is explained by network effects. Because of this, exponential growth in Particl is rational.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãScarcity is real. Scarcity is a contributing factor in the value increase of many traditional economic systems. The supply of Particl is fixed by a Proof of Stake protocol that cannot be changed.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãDemand, and utility, are multi-dimensional. Particl is much more than a financial asset like a stock or bond. It has the combined qualities of a share (like a security), a currency (like the US dollar), a payment network (like Paypal), and an eCommerce platform (like eBay, Amazon or Alibaba). BUT unlike any of these characteristics, Particl is also PRIVATE, GLOBAL, SECURE and DECENTRALIZED (no single point of failure). In other words, it is better described as a technological innovation that is disrupting how global commerce is conducted.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãThe digital asset market of cryptocurrencies has experienced several bubbles, but has also established a trend of positive growth over many years. Many more bubbles will form while new BULL markets (buying) and BEAR markets (selling) continue to cycle. Despite the volatility, when compared to more established financial markets, the crypto markets are very undervalued.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãParticl is the most INNOVATIVE digital asset the world has ever seen!
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãNETWORK EFFECT
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãNetwork Effect is a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. The Internet is an example. Initially, there were very few users of the Internet. It was of relatively little value to anyone outside of the military and some research scientists.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãBut, as more users gained access to the Internet, more content, information, and services were built into the system. More user-friendly websites were developed, and more users connected to communicate with each other. By making the Internet increasingly valuable to its users, these developments enhanced Network Effect.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãThe NETWORK EFFECT of Particl as follows:
‚Äã‚Äã

Business Adoption‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbusinesses will increasingly use Particl Open Marketplace because they can increase their profit margins by staking their $PART capital, avoiding eCommerce platform fees (amazon, eBay, etc.), credit card fees, charge-backs, privacy breach, data collection etc.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãConsumer Adoption‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconsumers can use Particl Open Marketplace to save money, simply by purchasing certain products on private-by-default Markets. Additionally, consumers can purchase items with $PART that they cannot buy (easily) in any other way. Consider: An American can buy Persian rugs or Cuban cigars despite trade embargoes.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãFinancialization‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäParticl will eat up progressively more of the market share of legacy centralized eCommerce platforms, money transmitter companies, etc.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämerchant, consumer, and speculator adoption lead to a higher price and thus incentivize more participants to stake (a Passive Income similar to dividends). This in turn makes the Particl network even more robust. The decentralized, immutable transaction ledger also serves as a form of Triple Entry Bookkeeping, wherein Debits plus Credits plus the Network Confirmations of transactions increase trust and security across the system.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãDeveloper Mindshare‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäParticl is a predictable network with simple rules and a publicly-auditable codebase. It is fertile ground for the development of complicated privacy and financial tools. Its decentralized nature allows for innovation without permission. Particl‚Äôs store-of-value characteristics will increase- as its utility as a medium of exchange on its Private Marketplaces also increases.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãAdoption as a Currency‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägrowth of Particl‚Äôs user base (organizations, businesses, individuals) will accelerate further increases in Particl‚Äôs price. Finally, a speculative rush could dramatically boost the value of Particl, almost overnight, by 10x or more.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãAdoption of Passive income‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe Particl Platform uses Particl Proof-of-Stake, its own native PoS protocol massively improving upon PoS3. Features added by Particl devs include: cold staking, quantum-resistance, voting and more. Stakers, the Particl equivalent of miners, can earn 4% yearly staking interest (dividend-like) in exchange for securing the network with their $PART cryptocurrency. On top of these staking rewards, stakers earn ALL fees and revenue generated by the platform (marketplace, decentralized applications, transactions, messaging, etc.) which means staking becomes increasingly profitable as more people participate in the Particl economy. Other ways to earn money on the Particl Privacy Platform include setting up a SHOP on the Particl Open Marketplace or using any other Particl Privacy Platform decentralized application on which revenue can be generated.
‚Äã‚Äã

Every Crypto enthusiast a real high risk/return investors and speculators should recognise Particl as opportunity to become a real millionaire by investing only $1000.


All top 20 cryptocurrencies are over billion market cap. Mostly driven by memes and very high risk/ return speculation.

PLEASE READ and UPDOOT!!üöÄ

I recently came across a post describing how Dogecoin was made to lose value and due to the amount of coins produced daily that it is virtually impossible to keep the price stable let alone actually grow. 

The current circulating supply is over 128 Billion!!!! That is an absolutely insane amount of coins.

I myself love the doge community and think it would be the greatest thing ever if a meme coin ended up being used as the first world currency. But if there are literally thousands of coins being produced an hour and continuously pushing the price down it seems impossible to require millions of dollars to pour in just to keep the coin stable. 

I offer a simple solution, Garlic Coin!! Garlic Coin is another Meme currency created on reddit but the one major difference it only had a circulating supply of 62million!!!!! If half the money that is in doge was in Garlic we would have to be taken serious by the rest of the crypto community as the price would be over $300 a coin.

This is just an opinion and I do hold Doge as well as Garlic in roughly equal amounts, I just want us to choose the coin that is most likely to achieve stability and actual use. 

Sorry for the long text and I will attach the post I saw that made me think of this  and I look forward to all your opinions, Long Live Meme Coins!!!!!!",CryptoCurrencies,DOGECOIN MODS KEEP DELETING!!!

1613291349,4,1,"I feel like Vertcoin is a coin that has a really easy chance to 100x.   The price is super low right now. It's tradable on very few exchanges,   as soon as its added to a few more, things are going to grow -- quickly.   It's got a super long history of honest developers who have always   tried to do things the right way. There was never a pre-mine, there was   never anything held back. The VTC team has the exact same access to   coins as you do. I could not be more impressed.

# Thoughtful Tech Built From Passion

Extremely   active development team who really work on it for love of the project.   They are gamers who just wanted to put their computers to work while  not  gaming. The coin is ""ASIC Miner Resistant"" and meant to be mined on   GPU's. For anyone not familiar (as I was not), ASIC Miners are the  truly  professional mining computers that you would see in a mining  farm. So  Vertcoin has worked hard towards fighting against professional  mining  farms.

Easiest coin to  mine in the  world. They offer what is called a ""One Click Miner"" which  is exactly  what it says. One click on your gaming PC and you are  suddenly mining  Vertcoin. Incredible simple to use and built to do  exactly that.

Lightning network compatible, [https://lightning.network](https://lightning.network/)   This makes Atomic Swaps possible which create an opportunity for coins   like Vertcoin to help with the congestion on Bitcoins network by   becoming a payment processor.

# Scarcity

VTC   team is actively working on applications to a variety of exchanges --   for the first time ever. As soon as its listed on the new exchanges,   demand is obviously going to rise. Currently it is not listed on very   many exchanges as all, very few people actually have access to buy it.   More buyers and more sellers on more exchanges are going to cause a huge   bump for this coin due to a combination of reasons listed above and   this new activity.

It's estimated   10% of circulating supply is 'dead'. Lost forever in abandoned wallets.   The supply is already low compared to other Crypto currencies. At some   point a collection of buyers is going to completely disrupt the  market.  With an already low limit of 84,000,000 coins, Vertcoin won't  be hitting  the same issues that other coins have hit with their massive  supply.

# Community

Even   during the long slow downtime of non-alt season, the Vertcoin  subreddit  remained active,  and the chat room remained active. They are  people  with passion for this project regardless of the actual prices  of the  coin. I love that.

Everyone  in  this community is always interested in helping each other improve  their  mining rigs and improve their setup. When you don't have to  battle  against the big mining farms, then cryptocurrency mining becomes  fun  again. That is very apparent in the Vertcoin community

I'm from a 3rd world country and I'm looking to invest in the crypto market before going to study abroad. 

I have a budget of \~4300USD to invest and I've done my fair share of research and this is what I've concluded:

1. BTC 1000 USD. Lowest risk, my prediction is that it'll reach 200k/per by the end of this year. 
2. ETH 1000 USD. ETH is the top altcoin right now from my understanding and the services it provides are fantastic. I hope it'll overcome its gas issue in the near future.
3. ADA 1000 USD. The contracts and investments it is making in Africa appear promising and  Charles Hoskinson just seems like a genuinely good person who wants to help the world. 
4. LTC 800 USD. Isn't this coin just an improved BTC?
5. DOT 500USD. I have high hopes for its scalability plans. 

Of course, I'm no investment advisor, nor am I looking for 1, but is my investment plan derived from my own research into the crypto market. Would you guys offer any non-professional advice or any opinion on my plan?

Ok i need some clarification here.

I seem to be losing out each time. There is currently a BNB/GUM liquidity farm on Pancakesawp. I put in just over 5.5 BNB in with 1800 GUM.

BNB has gone up since and GUM has gone down. Now i thought if i would come out of this farm and converted back my LP coins to the original assets i would get less BNB and more GUM but still equal to the value of what i put in first. BUT when i go to do it, it currently says i would get back 3.5 BNB and only 650 GUM!!!!

1617693335,2,1,"Not sure how many of you guys are aware of it but genesis shards is the project I‚Äôm highly interested in. is going to have its IDO on Polkastarter in a few days, It reimagines the way we look at NFTs and DeFi. NFTs have been a hot topic of late and DeFi has been cemented its space in not just the crypto world, but traditional market spheres as well. However, genesis shards marries both these ideas into a single, unified concept. 

Genesis shards is a decentralized ecosystem powered by Polkadot that redefines NFTs as DeFi options, creating a permissionless environment of interchain liquidity for pre-IDO tokens. What this means is that Genesis shards wrapps time-locked fungible tokens into NFTs which in turn can create a new market for previously illiquid tokens. 

Users can efficiently and safely gain access to and trade pre-IDO tokens, while projects can leverage token liquidity early in the life cycle, build strong community support early on in their journey, and also get a sense of price discovery. This is done by essentially ‚ÄúNFT-ing‚Äù the OTC market: transforming NFTs into a liquidity vehicle for pre-IDO tokens. 

Unlocking a new frontier in DeFi: A Pre-IDO marketplace on nonfungible tokens

The whole idea is pretty ingenious. When new tokens are released, they are pretty illiquid. Genesis shards use NFT wrappers to separate circulating tokens which have the added benefit of allowing easy price discovery and launchpad style crowd exposure. These NFTs could also contain pre-IDO tokens which can later be swapped for Post iDO tokens. 

GenShards is all about enabling ‚ÄúPre-IDO‚Äù liquidity ‚Äî and this is made possible through the Gen Ticket NFTs. At the most basic level, Gen tickets are NFT contracts that represent a varying amount of pre-IDO tokens. These NFTs can be traded on a compatible exchange or can be exchanged for the IDO tokens at the time of token generation events.

In the near future, projects will be able to launch their own GenTickets on the Genesis Shards platform ‚Äî and gain access to pre-IDO liquidity for their tokens!

The system is made up of 4 key components namely, Gen Access, Gen Tickets, Gen NFTC, and $GS token. $GS token is the utility token for the whole ecosystem which can be swapped for elements like Gen Access which users the entry into the Gen ecosystem. 

Some of the biggest names in the crypto investing sphere have partaken in its funding rounds. They had raised $2.7M from funds like 3Commas, Block Dream Fund by OKEx,  Morningstar, Moonwhale Ventures, Master Ventures, Petrock Capital.  It was also supported by angel investors like Santiago Roel Santos of Parafi Capital; Sandeep Nailwal = Polygon; Danish Chaudhry, CEO of Bitcoin.com, etc. Its founder is Garlam Won. Garlam was behind the marketing of some of the most successful projects including Harmony, Sandbox, MANTRADAO and more

Genesis Shards is having its first-ever dual IDO on Polkastarter wherein it will be available in both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. But they haven't announced the date. It will most likely be in the next few days and I encourage every one of you here to keep your notifications on. This will be one of the biggest launches of the year and is certain to go straight to the moon.",CryptoCurrencies,Combining NFTs and DeFi is most innovative idea in Crypto.

So now the big question, What are Binance Stock Tokens and how they work?
Well Binance Stock Tokens are tokens of stocks (i.e., shares of public companies) that trade on traditional stock exchanges. Each Stock Token represents one ordinary share of the relevant stock. These Stock Tokens are fully backed by a depository portfolio of underlying securities held by CM-Equity AG, Germany (‚ÄúCM-E‚Äù). Holders of Stock Tokens will qualify for economic returns on the underlying shares, including potential dividends.
Binance will monitor market demand and look to provide a channel to more Stock Tokens issued and sold by CM-E. Trading of Stock Tokens will follow traditional exchange hours and is not available for residents in Mainland China, Turkey, the United States and other restricted jurisdictions as finally determined by CM-E. Interested traders will only be able to trade Stock Tokens after satisfying all requisite Know-Your-Customer and other relevant compliance requirements.
Also Stock tokens are tradable after 2 minutes open and before 2 minutes close during market hours.
And Only users who has KYC, service agreement and completed the questionnaire can trade stock tokens.",CryptoCurrencies,"What are Stock token,where to trade them and why it is said to be best long term investment even better than bitcoin in terms of risk.."

I initially started with the intention to try and get lucky. Instead I found a great ecosystem with a ton of potential. I love the concept of mining and staking. They provide much better ways to earn without having to deal with banks etc. What I think I like the most about crypto is that it takes the benefits of a currency and combines it with the volatility of stock meaning if done right you should be earning a bit over time.

Now i'm accumulating crypto either mining or purchasing each week to stake. I think this is an amazing way to earn cash especially when paired with a crypto credit card.

1623050474,1,1,"HavaInu is the first DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for social media industries on BSC, and a community-centered initiative that strives to promote the adoption of BSC and blockchain in general.

This program is for those who are passionate about BSC, Binance, and BNB token (BSC's native token). By advocating for BSC as well as helping potential investors and projects to use BSC, members of BSC Army can receive passive incomes in HAVA token.

Token Specification

\- Name: Havana Inu

\- Symbol: $HAVA

\- Network: Binance Smart Chain

\- Spec: BEP-20

\- Smart Contract Address: 0x8fa15701d875bc873d322c6f3c5a76b06bf3140b

Token Features

To prevent the potential token price crash as well as to protect the benefits of the program members and HAVA holders, BSC Army utilizes three major functions which are RFI Static Rewards, Automatic Liquidity Pools, and Meme Bounty.

RFI Static Rewards is a relatively new mechanism in the decentralized market. It encourages people to hold HAVA, because holders will receive more HAVA based on the amount of token in transaction. Basically, the more HAVA one holds, the more HAVA one gets back.

Automatic Liquidity Pools (LP) offers two long-term benefits for HAVA holders.

¬∑ First, it adds token from both sellers and buyers to LP, increasing the liquidity of the token.

¬∑ Second, automatic LP charges a 10% ‚Äútax‚Äù whenever someone exits the LP and sells their HAVA to prevent the collapse of token price when whales decide to sell. This 10% tax is divided into 3 portions:

o 4% will be used to add liquidity for HAVA

o 5% will be shared to the remaining holders

o 1% will be given BSC Army members under Meme Bounty function

Meme Bounty is a special reward for BSC Army members who create content for the program. The 1% of transaction tax is distributed to members as follows:

¬∑ 90% goes to articles on BSC Army Newspaper, and quality videos on YouTube and TikTok that discuss BSC.

¬∑ 10% goes to members who use memes to shill BSC on Twitter. Currently, only Twitter users who use memes to shill BSC are eligible for Meme Bounty, those on other social media such as Reddit, Instagram, etc. will be supported later.

NOTE: Only whitelisted accounts can participate in Meme Bounty.

I remember [Brave opening their swag store on Origin Protocol's Dshop](https://medium.com/originprotocol/brave-launches-origin-powered-store-8288d9ce8fd0) platform but I had lost track of the subsequent collaborations.

Since I am keeping my eyes open on Origin Protocol from a fairly long time now, hold a decent bag of OGN plus the staked ones and  I am a Brave browser happy user and also hold some BAT, I am very happy to see that first collaboration was meant to be a deeper partnership rather than just a one-off thing. Also by what I read from both team members' statements it looks like they're cooking together something cool for the future.

These projects have both [strong fundamentals, goals, long-term plans](https://www.originprotocol.com/en/litepaper) and exceptional teams coming from top-notch Silicon Valley giants (that some of them have literally contributed to build).

I  had a blast following the last NFT live auction where bidders were 'fighting' in order to overbid each other during the last minutes of the auction, it went from like under $100,000 to over $760,000 in a bunch  of minutes.

This is cool already but I think is only starting to show the surface of a much bigger potential for their NFT tech use cases and it's great these excellent teams are working together.

I am confident we will hear about them both many times again and for a long time in the crypto space. Brave as the greatest Browser and the first with a great rewards system for their users through BAT and Origin Protocol as NFT leaders and among DeFI top 10 projects (OUSD worth a mention here, look it up if you don't know it, it changed completely my view on stable coins).

The [TABONG auction](https://tabong.brave.com/#/) will start next week, the 9th of June at 12pm PDT and will last only 30 mins so check when it happens on your time zone ([more info here](https://medium.com/originprotocol/brave-launches-origin-powered-store-8288d9ce8fd0)). As of now, apart of one or two items, the prices seem something also small investors might be able to afford so i might try to bid, you never know, although I know that can escalate very quickly as it happened during some previous auctions.

I  am setting a reminder and if you're intrigued by the future of NFTs and these projects I suggest you do that too to watch how this works. It's good eeven just to get familiar with the process, soon this could be the standard  for many NFT product sales.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúWe‚Äôve  been able to bring some excellent web3 utility cases to market through   our partnership with Origin; from crypto payments with BAT and ETH   through the Brave Store, to NFT sales through our BAT Community. We‚Äôre   very excited to collaborate with Origin on the *TABONG* NFT sale, and look forward to collaborating even more with Origin on future projects.‚Äù ‚Äî **Luke Mulks, VP Business Ops, Brave**  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic to deepen our partnership with Brave with the *TABONG*   NFT sale. As the NFT market rapidly expands from cryptocurrency early   adopters to more mainstream audiences, we‚Äôre excited to work with Brave   on bringing innovative NFT use cases to Brave‚Äôs 32M+ user base.  Brave‚Äôs  commitment to a privacy-centric and decentralized web are  perfectly  aligned with our aspirations to enable creators to engage and  interact  directly with their fans and collectors through NFTs.‚Äù **‚Äî Matthew Liu, Cofounder, Origin Protocol**",CryptoCurrencies,"Breaking: Brave (BAT) and Origin Protocol (OGN) have joined forces once again and are celebrating their strong and long-lasting partnership with the launch of an exclusive NFT drop named TABONG .

r/Koinos

https://coinmarketcap.com/nl/currencies/koinos/

Our mission is to empower people through ownership of their digital selves and blockchain is the most promising technology for accomplishing this mission. Blockchain-based applications can add value to people‚Äôs lives in an infinite variety of ways but building such applications is far too difficult, time consuming, and expensive.
In order to accomplish our mission we need to dramatically expand the quantity of blockchain powered applications in existence, and the number of people capable of using those applications, which is why we are building a brand new blockchain from the ground up to make it fast, easy, and affordable to build blockchain-based applications that are capable of delighting users.

The Blockchain
When it launches the Koinos mainnet will be a fast and fee-less blockchain that enables developers to create an unlimited number of free accounts for their users. Koinos won‚Äôt just lower the barriers to entry, it will obliterate them and open up blockchain applications to an order of magnitude more users.
At OpenOrchard we are developer obsessed which is why Koinos will enable developers to use the programming languages they already know and love thanks to WASM integration. Koinos will start with C++ support, followed soon after by typescript, and then whatever programming languages developers want most like .net and Go.
Thanks to these features, Koinos will deliver an unparalleled experience to both developers and their users, but that won‚Äôt launch for another 6 months, so what have we been doing up until now?

The Framework
We have built a brand new, high performance, vertically scalable, blockchain framework which can acquire any feature through smart contract modules running in the virtual machine. Because these smart contracts can be upgraded in-band, any behavior can be added to the blockchain without requiring a hardfork. This unlocks a new capability we call ‚Äúmodular upgradeability‚Äù which resolves one of the biggest challenges facing existing blockchains; how difficult they are to upgrade.

Modular Upgradeability
Modular upgradeability enables us to rapidly add different features to the framework without impacting any other part of the blockchain. This is how we will be able to offer a testnet in just 3 months that delivers Ethereum feature parity, but with WASM smart contracts, fast block times, and fee-less transactions. While the testnet will feature proof of work, the Koinos blockchain framework makes it easy for us to swap that consensus algorithm out for the totally new and different algorithm that we‚Äôre developing for mainnet.
Thanks to modular upgradeability, individual upgrades can be pushed to the network much like an operating system patch but with an on-chain record of the entire path that the upgrade took. Instead of having to package critical upgrades into time consuming, political, and risky hardforks, individual fixes can be pushed to the network the moment they are ready enabling Koinos to rapidly improve itself. It is that capability that we believe makes Koinos the first blockchain in history capable of¬†evolving.

Scalability
After upgradeability, the next major challenge facing existing blockchains is scalability. Blockchains hold on to every transaction and smart contract that has ever been added to them, regardless of whether they get used or not. That means that the cost of lugging around all of this expensive data gets baked into the cost of every new transaction which itself adds even more information to the chain. All of this old and unused data is responsible for the vast majority of the cost of running a blockchain. But what if we could remove all of that data, while retaining the ability to bring it back to life as if it had never left like MAGIC?

State-Paging
Well we have figured out how to do exactly that. We call it state-paging and Koinos will be the first blockchain ever to have it. Not only is this a genuine innovation that could be THE key to scaling blockchain to the masses, but existing blockchains like EOS and Ethereum cannot take advantage of this capability without totally rearchitecting their entire blockchain.
I saved state-paging for last because it is both highly innovative and highly experimental. All of the algorithms have been written and tested. We know we can page data out and back in without any loss in trustlessnes. State-paging works. What we‚Äôre not 100% sure about, is how much the memory savings will outweigh additional bandwidth consumption. But that‚Äôs mainly because we don‚Äôt know how people will use Koinos. In our tests we found that were state paging a part of existing blockchains, state size could be decreased by as much as 78% and that number would only increase as the blockchain got older. If we see similar numbers on Koinos, then state-paging will be a game-changer.
It‚Äôs just very important to us that we be upfront about what we have already developed, what we know we can develop but haven‚Äôt yet, and what we just don‚Äôt know yet. What we believe very much, is that Koinos will be our best attempt to resolve the major issues holding back blockchain adoption and denying people the empowerment that will come from digital self ownership. If this sounds like something that you want to be a part of, then we invite you to join us by firing up those miners.
Lastly, we really want to make sure that you receive important information about Koinos like how to claim your tokens when mainnet launches, so please join our mailing list by going to koinos or openorchard.

Upper bounds
At most 100,000,000 KOIN will be minted during the ERC20 phase.
After the airdrop on the Koinos blockchain mainnet, the Koinos blockchain will mint KOIN tokens at a rate of up to 15% per year.
Therefore, it is quite possible that up to 115,000,000 KOIN may exist one year after the launch of the Koinos mainnet.
There is no specific long-term upper bound on the amount of KOIN that will ever exist.
Importantly, Koinos's extreme upgradeability adds some degree of uncertainty to any discussion of the system's future trajectory:
The Koinos blockchain's governance system will be able to upgrade any part of the system.
We recommend that governance system participants should not ratify any upgrade that results in more than 15% per year minting.
However, it is possible that governance participants will not follow this recommendation.
This means it is theoretically possible KOIN tokens may be printed in excess of the 15% per year limit¬†if such changes are approved by governance.

1627975354,1,1,[removed],CryptoCurrencies,üí• DellToken is launching 3th Aug at 15:00 UTCüí•
1627977461,91,1,"Ethereum was initially a tech startup company and the Ether token was launched as a fundraising mechanism for the Ethereum business venture. They printed themselves to be the largest shareholder of Ether, approached a bunch of investors, pitched the investors a whitepaper and said if you give us money we will deliver you this roadmap and we will also print you a X% share of the network. To those from the business world, that sounds *a lot* like a stock offering. Ethereum even used the term ""IPO"" in their marketing, as the term ""ICO"" wasn't popular yet.

XRP often gets dunked on for largely being a stock ticker for Ripple Labs, but there aren't very many differences between Ripple and Ethereum concerning the launch. Both launched as a premine and they both printed themselves a big bag to periodically sell to ""fund"" operations. **The Ethereum Foundation sold $115,000,000.00 of ETH on Kraken at the literal top on May 17th, 2021.** Jed McCaleb, founder of XRP, also sold about $275,000,000.00 dollars worth of XRP in the month of May 2021.  Because of the similarities of the launches, the outcome of the SEC vs Ripple court case in the US will likely also negatively affect the legal status of Ethereum.

Vitalik Buturin and the Ethereum Foundation together **hold a whopping $30 billion USD** worth of Ethereum in their publicly disclosed wallets that they printed for themselves. Maybe I'm off base here, but I don't think billions of dollars are necessary to ""fund"" a small team of developers. What are they even doing with all of that money?  I dug around on their website, **I found no documents disclosing what they do with their funds**. Moreover, Vitalik was recently on a Lex Friedman podcast talking about his trading habits with other coins, and Vitalik discussed how he tried to time the top on certain coins like Dogecoin this market cycle. That discussion raised my eyebrows because I never recalled hearing Vitalik disclose that he owned any other wallets. I decided to dig through their website to find anywhere where they disclose their other wallets... **and again, I found no such disclosures**. Since Vitalik is confirmed to have undisclosed crypto investments, it's safe to assume that Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation likely hold **significantly** more Ethereum than what is known in the publicly disclosed wallets. Since there are no regulations in crypto, Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation have no legal obligation to be transparent about any of their finances or trades.

Do you really think Ethereum would have spent the last 5 years working towards transitioning to PoS if the founders didn't hold large ETH stacks?  The day PoS goes live on the Ethereum mainnet, is the day that both Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation's wallets become permanent endowment funds, essentially, destined to forever sit as King of the Hill, collecting taxes as staking rewards while being mathematically shielded from ever seeing their controlled market share diminish.

I guess the point I'm making is that *Ethereum didn't have to launch like this*. They could have had a clean, immaculate conception like Bitcoin. Proof of work consensus chains are supposed to start at the genesis block, the premine was 100% unnecessarily tacked on to self-serve the financial interests of the founders. Rather than making Ethereum a fully decentralized platform, the team opted to make Ethereum their own private business venture.",CryptoCurrencies,"My personal investigation into Ethereum uncovers a darker, more sinister purpose of what is the project really is for."

However they each fill a completely different a part of the ecosystem. Here is what you might want to learn about each the two, and why you wish to use a crypto change, and additionally keep a crypto pockets.

Whereas cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ether are generated while you ‚Äòmine‚Äô the tokens by fixing advanced equations, as traders, we‚Äôre usually simply shopping for and promoting the tokens that we use.

And a crypto change is the place you are able to do this (and additionally retailer your cash), whereas a pockets is a means in which you‚Äôll retailer your investments extra securely however will not be utilizing as actively. And actually, many main exchanges even have their very own separate pockets apps. Here is a extra detailed look.

What‚Äôs a cryptocurrency change?
A crypto exchange is a platform that allows you to purchase and promote your Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether, or different cryptocurrency tokens at mounted costs and with safety.

The change is a web site or an app that allows you to convert your fiat forex (like USD or INR) into cryptocurrency. You should use these exchanges to transform the crypto cash again to fiat forex and into your checking account.

In absence of an change, when you wished to purchase a crypto coin, you would need to discover one other particular person keen to promote that coin. Then each must agree at an change fee, then ship the crypto to your pockets, which is clearly a little extra sophisticated.

What‚Äôs a crypto pockets?
A crypto pockets is mainly a software program program that allows you to retailer crypto cash. Say you purchased a specific amount of Bitcoin, a type of digital forex. Because it has no bodily type, how do you safely hold it? That is the place you want an on-line storage facility. A crypto pockets will try this for you.

A crypto pockets has personal keys that will let you signal transactions. Consider these personal keys as secret codes that will let you spend the crypto coin that you just maintain. The blockchain is a report of all these transactions.

These personal keys are vital. If somebody steals your personal keys (by way of malware operating in your system), they might spend your crypto coin. Additionally, when you lose the personal keys by some other means, you lose all entry to your cryptocurrency holdings.

As we have explained before there are two essential kinds of crypto wallets ‚Äî scorching and chilly ‚Äî that confer with how every of those wallets works. Wallets add a layer of safety and hold your financial savings secure.

During the past few months, the congestion of Ethereum has led to high costs and poor user experience, which leads to an intense discussion about Ethereum2.0, scaling and Layer2. It is when ZK-Rollup stands out. The purpose of this paper is to focus ZK-Rollup in detail, thus we skip over wider concepts like Layer2.

## What is ZK-Rollup?

To understand ZK-Rollup, first we need to take a look at Layer2.

Layer2 is a secondary protocol built on top of the main chain parallel with it, sending and receiving information from the latter, so that transactions and changes in states that take place in Layer2 can be returned to and saved on the main chain. In this way, a great portion of computation can be moved from the main chain to this second layer, so the main chain only takes the responsibility of data verification and storage, which considerably lightens the load and improves the efficiency of the main chain.

ZK-Rollup is one of the Layer2 solutions, and can be understood with two concepts: Rollup and ZK, which stands for zero-knowledge.

The main idea of rollup is to batch a collection of transactions that happened off-chain, and post the compressed data with the previous account state and the new state on layer1. To be more specific, a rollup smart contract is placed on the main chain which maintains and updates a state root (a Merkle root, including the state and balance of accounts). When a collection of transactions are compressed into a batch (which also includes the previous state-root and the new state root) and sent to the main chain, the smart contract will check if the previous state root in the batch matches the current state root stored in the contract, and will update the Merkle root with a positive answer.

To guarantee the consistency of Layer1 and Layer2, and to prevent malicious activity, the post-state root in the batches must be guaranteed to be correct and safe by technological means, and ZK-Rollup uses zero-knowledge proof on this matter.

*‚ÄòZero Knowledge Proof‚Äô is a technique which employs cryptographic algorithms so that various parties can verify the veracity of an item of information without sharing the data that compose it. ‚Äî ‚Äî Teresa Alameda*

When the transaction is being packed, every batch includes a cryptographic proof called a ZK-SNARK (zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, using the PLONK protocol), which proves that the post-state root is the correct result of executing the batch. SNARK proves that this series of transactions is correctly approved and signed by the users and that the update of the account balance is correct from the previous Merkle root to the new Merkle root, so it is impossible for the relayer to submit an invalid or manipulated batch. As a result, ZK-Rollup is as safe as main chain on Ethereum.

Besides, ZK-Rollup will greatly reduce the burden of layer1, because hundreds of transactions are compressed into one batch, and the only thing that the smart contract on the main chain needs to verify is the ZK-SNARK. In this way, not only the transaction speed will be improved, but also gas fees will be reduced considerably.

## Advantages of ZK-Rollup

ZK-Rollup has absolute dominance in user experience, which can be concretely expressed as a high level of security, fast and economic transactions.

The reason why ZK-Rollup comes as the first choice is its security. As mentioned above, every change in state during transaction must be verified by a rollup smart contract, before the state can be updated. That is to say, no one can manipulate the state of the transaction or forge an invalid state. Secondly, other popular solutions like Plasma and Validium don‚Äôt have the on-chain data availability, however, ZK-Rollup not only returns the transaction results to the main chain, but also attaches sufficient data (necessary transfer information) with the batch to guarantee the consistency of account states in both layer1 and layer2. Moreover, ZK-Rollup only depends on the censorship-resistance of the main chain for its liveness rather than its security, meaning that even the censorship attack on layer1 can not manipulate the state on layer2, further ensures the security of assets and accounts.

In terms of user experience, apart from high TPS, there is no extra charge on every move happening on layer2 (for example, yield farming); in addition, uesers can share the gas fee when interacting with layer1 because the gas fee covers hundreds of transactions and is paid only once. More importantly, ZK-Rollup can reach the finality within several minutes, while in Optimistic Rollup with is based on Fraud Proof, there is a two-week Dispute Time Delay for stakeholders to challenge the correctness of the proof, meaning that assets need to be locked on the second layer for about two weeks. This DTD is replaced by ZK-SNARK in ZR-Rollup solution, which is based on validity proof and can guarantee authenticity and correctness of transactions and changes in state. Using ZK-Rollup, there is no need for users to experience the frustrating DTD, and assets can be returned to the layer1 and being withdrawed in minutes.

Because of its high security, high TPS, low transactions fees, and short waiting time, ZK-Rollup is considered the best Layer2 scaling solution in the long run.

## Why are there so few ZK-Rollup projects?

Despite the fact that ZK-Rollup is well-known by blockchain players, there are only few applications which actually land: zkSync, as the first project to explore ZK-Rollup, is still waiting for its complete application on Layer2; Loopring has released the first ZK-Rollup scaling Dex on Ethereum; ZKSwap recently realized the swap on a single chain by using ZK-Rollup‚Ä¶ It is easy to notice that among all the projects using ZK-Rollup technique, the latter is only implemented for some specific function points, lacking in a more general and thorough application.

This is because the development of ZK-Rollup is much more difficult and code-intensive than Optimistic Rollup and any other Layer2 scaling solutions. More advanced cryptographic knowledge, stronger coding capability, and longer development time are required to support the deployment of EVM. It takes time for ZK-Rollup to be fully compatible with EVMs, behind which is a higher standard for the team and capital.

However, it can be expected that ZK-Rollup, as the safest and the most user-friendly scaling solution, will become the mainstream in the near future. Those fewer and better teams who can play with ZK-Rollup can be trusted to create more attractive applications with superior quality and sustainable development ability, firing up the second evolution for Ethereum and other public chains.",CryptoCurrencies,What is ZK-Rollup?

1632558980,4,1,"The growth of the cryptocurrency industry in 2021 has led to the rise in prominence of new blockchains beyond market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving developers new platforms to build decentralized applications.

Against this background, Binance Smart Chain has risen as one of the top-performing networks in 2021, with its fast-growing ecosystems and huge growth potential.

Here are some of the top emerging platforms built on the BSC:

1. PancakeSwap: PancakeSwap is one of the leading AMM (automated market maker) DEX (decentralized exchange) on Binance Smart Chain. PancakeSwap makes swapping of BEP-20 tokens secure and efficient.
2. Lendefi Finance: The purpose of Lendefi Finance is to make it easy for anyone to access funding. Thus, it enables getting uncollateralized loans on Binance Smart Chain. As a uniquely designed product, Lendefi Finance leverages top DeFi lending pools and opens gateways to uncollateralized loans.
3. Pledge: Pledge aims to be the crypto-asset lending platform for all. Unlike most available lending protocols, they aren't focused on crypto traders borrowing digital assets in real-time for day trading. Instead, Pledge answers the need for longer-term financing, mainly serving crypto-asset holders to diversify their portfolio with non-crypto assets, e.g. real estate, without the friction of portfolio. Backed by the best from Stanford University, this is one of the most anticipated projects on the BSC.
4. Autofarm: Autofarm¬†is a revolutionary cross-chain yield aggregator built on Binance Smart Chain. It is designed to switch the user‚Äôs investment automatically to the more profitable liquidity pools. It is one of the first cross-chain yield optimizers built on BSC and it integrates DEX, Swaps, and Vaults.
5. DeFi Yield Protocol: DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) is another innovative project built on Binance Smart Chain. This promises to help users mitigate the risk associated with Yield Farming. It seems to make it possible by developing a platform to allow anyone to provide liquidity.

Over the last year, Binance Smart Chain has continued to expand its capabilities. It is cheaper and faster and allows developers to build performant solutions on top. Looking at the rising demands in the DeFi and NFT space, BSC seems to be the best option.

What are some of your favourite projects built on the BSC?",CryptoCurrencies,Platforms on the Binance Smart Chain with the most potential

1633338563,24,1,"Hello to all, has anyone ever gotten their metal seed phrase taken by airport security? What's the best way in your opinion to safely get your metal seed phrase through customs/airport security without it been compromised or taken? Hardware wallets devices w/e can be replaced but generally there isn't a concern about that. The seed phase is the concern here. 

If you are using a CryptoSteel capsule or a product that enables the words to be disassembled; You can remove all the words off it put it in your checked in luggage NOT carry on risk of it been taken &amp; keep your phrase during transit on a carry on written in a book or piece of paper, then reassemble it later. 

However engraved metal seed phrases on plated sheets are problematic here, can possible be seen on the x ray or so what is your best advise on the matter? You obviously want to ensure your seed phrase is kept with you at all times so carried on with you; It is considerably risky to put it in your check in luggage the crap that goes in the cargo hold. What if there is a chance your luggage goes missing or is x-ray without you noticing your keys can be compromised.  There is a good risk of customs/security seizing your metal plate with your seed phrase on it, during the security checkpoints.

Personally I'd only have to take my metal seed phrase through customs/airport security if I was emigrating. Some people are going to encounter this issue, regardless needs to be addressed. Thoughts?",CryptoCurrencies,Getting a metal seed phrase through airport security/customs?

It has been more than 50 years since Richard Nixon unilaterally established the current monetary and financial system. Since then, the dominance of the US dollar over the world has continued to grow.

Some even believe that no currency will be able to overthrow the domination of the dollar king.

If we stick to fiat currencies, I think that the king dollar has no rival.

Nevertheless, you have to look at the world of the future to see that the US dollar actually has a lot more to worry about than many people imagine today. In a future world where everything will be digital, the U.S. dollar will face a completely different kind of competition from Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has the potential to overthrow the U.S. dollar's hegemony over the world. There is no guarantee that it will succeed, but it is our best chance for a better future world because Bitcoin represents a fairer system for the many.

The world deserves apolitical and neutral hard money. Bitcoin is our chance.

1639210725,3,1," On the OpenSea subreddit there seem to be endless NFT giveaways where you simply leave your wallet address and upvote in order to receive an NFT.

Although these NFTs are likely to be worthless, I was just wondering if there was any downside to participating in these giveaways. Is there any real risk to posting your wallet address or could these free NFTs somehow contain malware? And as a receiver of these free NFTs do you need to pay gas fees (hopefully polygon anyway).

I would appreciate everyones' thoughts on this topic.",CryptoCurrencies,Downside to Free NFT drops on OpenSea?

The reason for that is that the EU fu\*ked up the wording in their short report, and havn't even linked the newest document in it:

&amp;#x200B;

Just search for ""unhosted"" and read the 2 results:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""(18a) Similarly, persons that are merely ancillary participants, which do not provide or actively  facilitate the transfer of crypto-assets, such as persons that provide only Internet services, cloud  services, a gateway to connect to a distributed ledger network (for example a so called ‚Äúunhosted  wallet‚Äù) or nodes that help validate the transactions, should not fall within the scope of this  Regulation.""
2. ""(29) This Regulation applies not only to transfers of crypto-assets where both the crypto-asset  service provider of the originator and beneficiary are involved but also to transfers of crypto-assets  to or from a distributed ledger address not linked to a crypto-asset service provider, so called  ‚Äúunhosted wallets‚Äù, as long as there is at least one crypto-asset service provider involved in the  transfer of crypto-assets.""

The boom of nft games on the blockchain has brought big gains but also big losses and one of those is due to the extreme economic bleeding that these same nft games suffer.
People enter only in order to earn money and not to play. To top it off, most of these games are just click-to-earn, they do not require any kind of skill, so there is no real reward for the player.
That's why the games bleed out so quickly and the losses are so great. Finally to kill these games, the games themselves do not generate re-investment and this just pulverizes the internal economy of the game.
Now comes the opinion I'm looking for, as this is an opinion post I'd like to know what the most knowledgeable people on Reddit think.
Do you think a triple A title on the blockchain that encourages playing and skill before making money could solve this economic issue?
Decentralized blockchain technology development groups such as DIG, are making the case for converting triple A titles to blockchain gaming and its entire world.

Do you see it possible?""",CryptoCurrencies,"Redditors, would you play a blockchain game for the sake of playing or for the sake of making money?"

Ads are like necessary evils in our digital world. But who doesn‚Äôt want a world without these devils? Whether necessary or not. In my journey through life in the internet age, I am yet to meet someone who thinks ads are cool. The mere development of ad blocking extension for browser already identifies this problem. The billions of downloads on all ad blockers further proves the point that ads are annoying and the world is genuinely open to an alternative to put an end to them. 

Blockchain/crypto projects are evidently building products around this problem. Projects like Gather Network are solving this problem wholistically. Advertisement is undoubtedly a justification for breach of data privacy because companies want to monetise their website which necessitates the processing and transfer of private information to achieve targeted ads. Gather Network has shown that it‚Äôs innovative technology could ultimately liberate and democratize the internet space by letting website derive income based on the numbers of visitors instead of ads. 

The success of $BAT token crossing over a billion-dollar market cap shows how much of acceptance this type of innovation has. The world is titling towards decentralization and the publicity of the imminent coming of Web 3.0 shows that a blockchain alternative to end the unnecessarily prolonged reign of ads is a product worthy of massive adoption. Additionally, I am more fascinated about the sustainability of Gather Network as it is designed to be less energy intensive, hence, pushing towards greener and more sustainable blockchain.

Why should anyone want to buy and hodl Gather Network? The answer to this is very simple and straightforward. It has a low market cap of a little over $7m which implies that the project is very young and suitable for early investors. Also, for a project featuring product with high tendency of massive adoption, the current price is ridiculously cheap. 

Evidently, there is no better time to bag some $GTH tokens.",CryptoCurrencies,This Blockchain alternative to website monetisation might end the unnecessarily prolonged reign of ads.

Not to get too political but its honestly not fair and frankly a spit in the face of everyone trying their best globally to be part of the platform to be suddenly banned without warning. Some people live off of this platform and them not being able to access their library all of sudden or being redirected to an error 404 page can be scary. 

Anyone enforcing sanctions should state clearly how these sanctions apply and leave the people out of it, it's really setting the platform back and it just demotivates people who are starting startups on platforms like solanaprime and working on innovating the space moving forward, they need to all be given equal opportunity to make it. And that's how it's always supposed to be.

I don't like how they're dragging their feet with the ETH 2.0 transition.

# What Is DeFi?

Before diving into the practical things, it‚Äôs important to understand the basics that power everything we are going to do in DeFi. So let‚Äôs start by understanding what DeFi is and how it differs from traditional finance.¬†

There are many different ways we use our money in the course of our life‚Äîbuying goods, exchanging our local currency for foreign ones, getting a loan, investing in a company, and more. All these transactions are facilitated by financial corporations, like banks, controlled and owned by a small group of shareholders.¬†

Since anything we do with our money is controlled by these institutions, this system is known as centralized finance (CeFi) or traditional finance (TradFi). This is the financial system we are all familiar with, in which third parties control all our transactions while charging a fee for their services. For example, whenever you buy a cup of coffee by card, you and the merchant are not the only parties involved in the transaction. Your bank, the shop‚Äôs bank, and a financial network like Visa or Mastercard are typically involved too. And each party charges a fee for its service.¬†

Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers us all the same financial instruments and opportunities of traditional finance (like buying goods, or lending money for a yield) without any intermediary like banks or brokerage firms as they are replaced by blockchain and smart contracts. Using DeFi applications, you will be able to lend or borrow crypto from peers, trade crypto assets without any centralized entity, earn high interest, and much more. In this guide, we will mainly focus on how to use DeFi to earn a high and safe yield on USDC.

# What Are Stablecoins?

Since the first Bitcoin block was mined, volatility has been one of the main problems for the broader adoption of crypto. Popular cryptos like BTC or ETH often reach dizzying heights one day and plummet to gut-wrenching depths the next. Needless to say, the huge volatility would have never allowed for the mainstream adoption of blockchain. That‚Äôs where stablecoins come in.¬†

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value doesn‚Äôt fluctuate, thus the name ‚Äústable.‚Äù They are stable because their value is based on and pegged to stable real-world assets. Usually, stablecoins are backed by currency like the U.S. dollar.¬†

Those are also known as fiat-collateralized stablecoins because they are backed by money issued by governments. This includes currencies like the USD, EUR, or GBP. As long as the economy of the currency‚Äôs country remains stable, so will fiat-backed stablecoins.¬†

Fiat-backed stablecoins are collateralized 1:1. That means for every stablecoin in circulation, a single unit of currency ($1) is kept in a bank account to back it up. If you want to trade in your stablecoin for cash, you will receive the equivalent directly from the issuer, such as Circle for the USDC stablecoin, or purchase it on a crypto exchange like Coinbase. The stablecoins corresponding to the amount you retrieved will be taken out of circulation if you redeem them with the issuer.

# Earn Yield With DeFi: Lending¬†

Exactly as you can do in traditional finance, one of the main ways to earn yield in DeFi is to lend your funds to someone for interest. So how does that work? How do you lend your funds to someone? Is it safe? How can you be sure that you‚Äôll get your money back?

If you had to lend $1,000 to a friend, you could agree to give him the money if he will pay it back after one year with a 10% yield. So your friend would give you back $1,100 after one year, and you would have realized a nice profit on your funds.

However, if you give the same $1,000 to a complete stranger on the internet, chances are you would never see your money again. That‚Äôs why if someone wants to borrow funds via DeFi, they must give collateral in exchange. For example, if I want to borrow $1,000 worth of USDC, I have to give $2,000 worth of ETH as collateral. This way, the other party knows that I won‚Äôt run away with their money. I know what you are thinking: ‚ÄúWhy the hell would someone give $2,000 worth of ETH to get back $1,000 of USDC? Can‚Äôt they just sell $1,000 worth of ETH to get the money they need?‚Äù Well, this is exactly what I thought the first time I heard of crypto lending and borrowing, but don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll understand everything in a minute.

# Understanding Crypto Borrowing

At first glance, crypto borrowing might not seem that reasonable. However, there are many reasons for a borrower to use ETH as collateral to borrow crypto instead of selling it.¬†

* **Liquidity Needs:** Let‚Äôs say I am a long-term holder of BTC and ETH and I have most of my net worth in crypto while holding very few fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar to pay for day-to-day expenses. However, an unforeseen event like a car accident happens and I need a great amount of USD to repair my car or buy a new one. I could sell $20,000 worth of BTC to satisfy my liquidity needs and buy it back after a year. However, if BTC appreciates in value by 30% in that year, I would incur a 30% loss. Instead of selling, I can use my BTC as collateral and borrow the amount of USD I need while paying a 5% annual fee. This way, I can be exposed to BTC capital appreciation while still having the liquidity I need to pay the unforeseen expense.
* **Investment Leverage:** Another popular reason to borrow crypto is to have some investment leverage. For example, let‚Äôs say that I hold $20,000 worth of BTC. If Bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, I earn $6,000. However, if I use $20,000 BTC as collateral to borrow $10,000 USDC, I can then use that to buy another $10,000 worth of BTC. If Bitcoin appreciates by 30% in one year, I earn $9,000 and, after paying $500 worth of interest, I have a net gain of $8,500 instead of just $6,000. This is the same concept of using leverage as you would see in traditional finance. However, instead of getting the leverage via a broker, I get it via a decentralized liquidity protocol.¬†

# Understanding Smart Contracts

Now that you know why someone would borrow stablecoins for collateral, there are some other pieces to add to the puzzle. If the borrower gives you $2,000 in ETH as collateral to borrow $1,000 in USDC, who‚Äôs to stop you from running away and selling it on the market? And what happens if you receive ETH, but then its value drops significantly? If the transactions happened just between you (the lender) and the borrower, the only way to make it work would be to trust each other. However, this is not the premise of blockchains and DeFi. Instead, we need a trustless system where things like this can work without needing trust and without any centralized institutions like banks. This is where smart contracts come in.¬†

A smart contract is a piece of code on the blockchain that runs when specific conditions are met. When you want to lend cryptos for an interest, instead of interacting directly with the borrower, the two of you will use a smart contract that manages the transaction. This is how it works:

1. You (the lender) deposit $1,000 worth of USDC into the smart contract using a blockchain application (we‚Äôll see later how to do this).¬†
2. The borrower deposits $2,000 worth of ETH as collateral into the smart contract.¬†
3. The smart contract gives the borrower $1,000 worth of USDC while locking the ETH deposit. This way, you cannot run away with the borrower‚Äôs ETH.¬†
4. When the borrower deposits $1,000 worth of USDC back in the smart contract, the code will give him back the ETH deposited minus the interest needed to pay you.¬†
5. You receive the $1,000 deposited plus any interest.¬†
6. If, in the meantime, the value of ETH drops below a certain threshold, the smart contract will automatically sell ETH and pay you back. This way, your funds are protected against any market drop thanks to the code that runs automatically.

[Here is an infographic](https://preview.redd.it/b5dhntp0bwr81.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49c4ee8508817db195330e28d358f8a1638c0be2) of how that works (illustrated). 

Now that you have learned the ins and out of crypto lending and borrowing and how smart contracts make all of this possible, you need to understand how to actually use a blockchain app and a crypto wallet to start earning your first yield with DeFi.

# What Is a Blockchain App?¬†

As promised at the beginning of the guide, this is not an average theoretical guide. At the end of it, you will be able to actually start earning yield with DeFi by using all the tools and apps needed. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to understand what a blockchain app is and how to use it.

A blockchain application (also known as a decentralized application, or Dapp) is a digital program just like any other app we use in our everyday lives. There are blockchain applications for gaming, investing, social media, and music that you can use via your browser or smartphone. The main difference from other apps is that instead of running on a centralized server owned by a company, decentralized applications run on a blockchain like Ethereum or Polygon.¬†

That‚Äôs why Dapps are not subject to the control of any single authority. For example, anyone can develop a social media platform like Instagram and run it on a blockchain to allow any user to publish posts or comments. Once published, no one‚Äîincluding the Dapp developers‚Äîcan modify or delete any posts.

As already mentioned, there are blockchain applications for many different use cases including gaming, social media, and music. The ones that interest us the most are decentralized applications for lending and borrowing, also known as *liquidity protocols.* 

So how do we use these apps? How do we add our funds to a liquidity protocol to earn a 15% yield on USDC? To do that, we need a cryptocurrency wallet that can connect to blockchain applications. Indeed, while crypto exchanges like Coinbase are the most popular options to start your crypto journey, they don‚Äôt allow you to get the most out of your crypto because you cannot connect them to blockchain applications. That‚Äôs why we need a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.

# What Is a Crypto Wallet and Why Do You Need One?

If you‚Äôre not completely new to crypto, you‚Äôve probably already used a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase or Crypto.com to buy and store crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. While they are a perfect way to get started and buy your first cryptos, they don‚Äôt allow you to fully explore the opportunities coming from DeFi and Web3. Furthermore, when you store cryptos via an exchange, you don‚Äôt fully own them because they control your private key. As the saying goes, ‚Äúnot your keys, not your cryptos.‚Äù¬†

On the other hand, with a non-custodial wallet, only you have access to your private key, and no one can control your funds. Furthermore, a self-custody wallet is also required to use blockchain applications and participate in DeFi.¬†

# Which Crypto Wallet to Choose

There are different types of cryptocurrency wallets available on the market, with the main distinction being between hardware wallets (also known as cold wallets because they are not connected to the internet) and software wallets (also known as hot wallets), which are mobile or desktop apps.¬†

Hardware wallets are physical devices similar to a USB considered to be more secure than hot wallets. However, they are more difficult to use and are not recommended for beginners. On the other hand, hot wallets are easier to use because they are simple desktop or mobile applications. However, they are considered to be less secure because they are connected to the internet, and thus it can be easier for an attacker to access your private key.

The main problem with both types of wallets is that if you lose, or someone steals, your seed phrase (which is a 12 to 24-word password to access and recover your wallet), you‚Äôve lost your funds forever. 

A better alternative is to use a smart wallet. Smart wallets are a new type of non-custodial wallet that offers advanced security while also being much easier to use. As such, they are the best option to get started with DeFi and Web3.  

In this guide, we‚Äôre going to use Linen Wallet but you can use another wallet if you want. So how can Linen Wallet be so secure while also being much easier to use?   


* **Multi-keys:** Using a smart contract, Linen Wallet is secured using three keys, not just one like most non-custodial wallets. Two out of the three keys are required to make a transaction. As such, even if someone steals one key, they won‚Äôt be able to access your funds. Other non-custodial wallets only have one key, and if someone gets access to it, all your funds are lost forever.
* **Easy wallet recovery:** One of the main problems with other non-custodial wallets is that you have to store your private key yourself on a piece of paper or metal card. As such, the risk of losing it is very high. Instead, Linen Wallet makes it easy to manage your private keys‚Äîone key is stored in your cloud, one in your mobile device, and one in Linen‚Äôs secure server infrastructure, so you can seamlessly recover your wallet using your cloud drive, email, and phone number.

# Download and Set Up Linen Wallet

You now need to download and set up your crypto wallet to connect to blockchain apps. Search Linen Wallet page in the App Store. Once there, click on ‚ÄúGet‚Äù to download the app. Once downloaded, follow the instructions in the following video to set up your wallet. It will take less than a minute:

*Processing video 9bfrawnq19w81...*

Everything is set up, and the only thing missing is the crypto that we‚Äôre going to invest in with DeFi. So we need to deposit some funds to our Linen Wallet. There are two ways to do that:

# In-app Purchase by Card

You can purchase USDC directly in the app. Just click on the ‚ÄúBuy Crypto‚Äù button in the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù section of the app, select the crypto to buy (in our case, USDC on the Polygon Network), and add your card details. The only drawback is that Simplex requires a 5% fee with a minimum fee of $10 (This fee doesn‚Äôt go to Linen but to the payment processor. We don‚Äôt take any fee for deposits).

# Deposit Funds via an Exchange

If you already have some funds stored in an exchange, you can send them to Linen Wallet. To do that, follow these instructions:

* **Get your Linen Wallet address**‚ÄîYour blockchain address is like an email that can be used to send you money. You will use it when withdrawing funds from an exchange to send them to your Linen Wallet. You can find your address in the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù section of the app under the title *Polygon Wallet Address.*
* **Important:** The address we‚Äôve just copied is on the Polygon Network. For this reason, it is important that the exchange you are using supports withdrawal to the Polygon Network. If you use this address to withdraw but the exchange only supports Ethereum, you will send your funds to someone else. To make a practical example, let‚Äôs take the email address ‚Äú[myname@gmail.com](mailto:myname@gmail.com).‚Äù You can imagine your address as the unique address that identifies you on a certain blockchain (‚Äúmyname‚Äù would be your address), while the second part of the email is the blockchain you are using (gmail.com). If you try to send an email to ‚Äú[myname@yahoo.com](mailto:myname@yahoo.com),‚Äù it won‚Äôt be delivered to the person intended. The same applies to blockchain addresses. In this case, Polygon is the network to use and your address is your identifier on the Polygon Network. 
* **Send USDC to Linen Wallet:** After copying your Linen Wallet address, you can withdraw funds from the exchange. Make sure that the exchange supports withdrawal to a Polygon wallet. For example, Crypto.com lets you select the network from which to withdraw USDC. If the exchange you are using doesn‚Äôt let you choose the network, DO NOT withdraw your funds.

# Earn a 15% Yield on USDC

Now that we‚Äôve understood all the basic theory behind DeFi and that we know how to set up and fund our crypto wallet, it‚Äôs time to start earning some nice yield on our stablecoins. You already know what a DeFi blockchain app is and how it works on the backend. Let‚Äôs now see what blockchain app to use and how to earn a 15% yield on USDC.

One of my favorite blockchain apps is Orion Money, a blockchain app that allows anyone on any network to access the best stablecoins yield available in DeFi. At the moment of writing, it features a 15% yield on USDC, Dai, Tether, and UST. Furthermore, the 15% yield is fixed and not variable as it is for most liquidity protocols so we can enjoy a nice and stable 15% yield knowing that this won‚Äôt change overnight.¬†

By the way, I‚Äôm not affiliated in any way with Orion Money and I‚Äôm using it for this video just because it‚Äôs actually the app I use for my own DeFi investment. On a side note, you could also use directly the Anchor Protocol for a higher yield, but that is a little bit more complicated and I might do a separate guide for that.

For more information about Orion Money, you can head over to their¬†help center, where they share all the details behind the project, the tech, and the team.¬†

# How To Use Orion Money

If you have been using other blockchain apps before you know that simplicity is not what they are famous for. However, this is not the case with Orion Money, which is extremely simple to use‚Äîyou are less than two minutes away from putting your money to work with DeFi. You‚Äôll learn everything you need to know in the following video:

*Processing video vxyflw7l29w81...*

You now understand all the basic theory behind DeFi. Of course, there is still much more to learn and earn‚Äîliquidity pools, impermanent loss, yield farming, and auto compounding are just some of the many things you can go deeper into. However, you already know how to get a nice and stable 15% yield on stablecoins so you already know more than 90% of crypto enthusiasts.¬† If I receive great feedback from this first DeFi guide, I will gladly publish a new guide about other DeFi topics.",CryptoCurrencies,A DeFi Guide for Beginners: From 0 to 15% Yield in Under 40 Minutes

When everything feels like a punishment and struggle, even the gift of life itself. What could the next step possibly be?

Psychedelic drugs are highly controversial, but some research implies that they may help treat PTSD, depression, anxiety, and more. What happens when Psychedelic treatment and NFTs are mixed? You get the project Psychedelics Anonymous for starters. This project aims to donate and financially support organizations that provide psychedelic-assisted therapy (CPAT). How, you might ask? Through selling NFTs, auctioning, and eventually, through IRL and virtual P2E challenges.

In this research report, we‚Äôll dive into an NFT project that, after our immense research, truly has deserved our confidence. We‚Äôll take a look at the project itself, their core values ‚Äì the four pillars, everything about their NFT assets, artwork, team composition, and more.

JollyCake is the next evolution of a yield-generating contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): you get rewarded in CAKE instead of tokens. The token contract employs a static rewards system‚Äî14% of every transaction is split:

‚Ä¢ 10% CAKE is redistributed to holders.

‚Ä¢ 1% is used to fuel the liquidity pool exchange growth.

‚Ä¢ 3% CAKE is allocated to the Buy back / Marketing wallet.

**Extra 1% Sell Fee**

Swing trading is a common practice that can affect price action. To incentivize holding and reducing pump/dump dynamics, we added an extra 1% sell fee on top of the initial

14% transaction fee. Total sell fee = 15%

**Classic Redistribution**

This is a concept that was popularized by Safemoon. The mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).

Redistribution is based on percentage (in the contract), current token balance and number of holders.TL; DR: You receive more tokens automatically.

**JollyCake Redistribution**

We created a unique system that auto-claims for every single holder the amount due. We call it the JollyCake Machine. The way it works for holders: You buy tokens and hold them, every 60 minutes you‚Äôll automatically receive CAKE in your wallet. Not a single action is required. Your JCAKE tokens amount is persistent and won‚Äôt change.

Note: In periods of low volume CAKE may not be sent out every hour, but don‚Äôt worry. It accumulates and is then sent when ready. You‚Äôll never miss out.

**Behind The Scenes:**

‚Ä¢ The contract keeps track in an array of all token holders.

‚Ä¢ The contract keeps an index into the array for processing.

‚Ä¢ Every transaction processes a certain number of users, depending on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens).

‚Ä¢ The token is based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all CAKE the contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the token holders.

‚Ä¢ When a user is processed, the contract checks how many withdrawable dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum threshold for auto-claims, will either automatically claim those dividends for CAKE, or automatically buy back tokens for them.

This system is fully automated and doesn‚Äôt add minimal gas fees proportional to value transferred. The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size. Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It‚Äôs a fair system, fully automated. Minimum token balance is 20,000 JCAKE tokens to receive CAKE distributions.

**DEX Public Listing:**

Following the Fair Launch, JCAKE tokens will become available for purchase on PancakeSwap Exchange.

1660572038,0,1,"Over the last few days, the crypto-verse witnessed the downfall of a successful project. Tornado Cash was undoubtedly a hotbed for hackers. Since the details of transactions are often hidden on the Ethereum-based platform, illegal funds were laundered on it. The US government imposed sanctions on the platform, and Dutch authorities followed suit by arresting the platform‚Äôs developer. While some were against this as it meddled with the decentralization factor of the industry, Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, aka Mr. Wonderful, was rather glad about the ordeal.

O‚ÄôLeary suggested that crypto mixers like Tornado Cash were linked to the ‚Äúcrypto cowboy culture.‚Äù Until this existed, the likelihood of increased institutional interest in crypto was relatively low, he noted. He further added,

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre getting to that stage now. Maybe we‚Äôre in the third or fourth inning towards that, but I‚Äôm tired of this crypto cowboy crap. I want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work. I don‚Äôt need to be a crypto cowboy, and I don‚Äôt want to be one because I work in the regulated world.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it‚Äôs okay to arrest that guy. Why? He‚Äôs messing with the primal forces of regulation \[‚Ä¶\] If we have to sacrifice him, that‚Äôs okay, because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital.‚Äù

He further suggested that the crypto-verse should emerge as a ‚Äúrules-based environment.‚Äù Only then will it lure in more institutional capital.

1661949657,0,1,"CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer on Tuesday implored investors to stay away from speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies, warning that they will continue to struggle during the ongoing Federal Reserve tightening cycle.

‚ÄúLook, Fed chief Jay Powell told us that we need to stop doing stupid things with our money. That was the thrust of his speech on Friday,‚Äù the ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host said, referring to the top U.S. central banker‚Äôs Jackson Hole address, in which Powell warned the Fed‚Äôs commitment to squashing inflation could bring ‚Äúsome pain‚Äù to American businesses and households.

Wall Street has finished lower in three straight sessions as investors digest Powell‚Äôs Friday morning remarks.

Powell is ‚Äúgoing to bring the pain until it puts an end to the gambling,‚Äù Cramer said. ‚ÄúOf course, he‚Äôll also hurt some good investments in the process ... but we won‚Äôt see the end of this decline until we get a giant washout of all things that are speculative.‚Äù

That includes, but is not limited to, cryptocurrencies, said Cramer, who also acknowledged he no longer believes in the argument that bitcoin is a store of value. In Cramer‚Äôs opinion, other speculative parts of the market to avoid are money-losing firms that went public via special purpose acquisition companies and meme stocks.

‚ÄúThis is what it looks like when the Fed gets serious,‚Äù Cramer said. What matters is that we just have to get through it intact. Don‚Äôt get memed. Don‚Äôt get SPAC‚Äôd. Don‚Äôt get crypto‚Äôd. And you‚Äôll get through this thicket and find yourself in a much better time when we are sufficiently oversold for a huge bounce.""

 Jim Cramer says ‚ÄúLook, Fed chief Jay Powell told us that we need to stop doing stupid things with our money"" ""avoid all speculative investments like crypto""

1570797416,0,1,"The Monero community continues their aggressive tactics of getting any information they don't like censored and removed. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/dg1yio/system76_will_begin_shipping_2_linux_laptops_with/f39pqxq/) in r/linux was heavily upvoted and has been removed by thoughtpolice at the behest of the Monero community.

&gt;**Edit 2: Unfortunately the moderators of r/linux have decided to side with the monero community and permaban me from this sub for exposing Monero's vote brigading and harassment across reddit. You can tell this is the case because they left flenst's reply up and deleted my replies to him.**

&gt;**Even though I didn't bring cryptocurrency into this discussion until I was vote brigaded (Which is against reddit's rules so the mods should be on my side here). This is the extent to which the Monero community will manipulate public discourse.**

&gt;**Edit: Unfortunately, it appears this comment and my other comments in this thread are being vote-brigaded down. This is presumably the work of the very aggressive and toxic monero community, members of which have admitted to following/stalking my posts across reddit before. One of which replies below and attempts to lie about our history while continuing to censor my content. This action is to make my posts appear less popular than they are and is a form of manipulation.**

&gt;I've had my System76 box for a couple years and I must say, this laptop still runs like new! It still takes the exact same couple seconds to boot, CPU usage remains low despite a consistently heavy task load, and the machine is as responsive and performant as the day I bought it. Pop!_os is great, unlike Ubuntu, I can't really say there's any quirks or annoyances. Honestly, switching to Linux was the second best decision of my computing life. The first was getting a System76 computer.

The user flenst, who is an aggressive shill for Monero that admitted to following me around and stalking my comments on reddit replied (and the moderators of course left his reply up while deleting my replies to him):

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/dg1yio/system76_will_begin_shipping_2_linux_laptops_with/f3afvbb/

&gt;[‚Äì]Flenst 9 „Éù„Ç§„É≥„Éà 7ÊôÇÈñìÂâç 

&gt;I will report your anti Monero stuff (something you could call ""toxic and aggressive"") as targeted harassment.

&gt;Accusing, without any evidence, some other communities in comments that were received well, in an edit afterwards, is abusive and, as you call it, manipulative.

The only reason this user knew about this comment was because he stalks me on reddit. I didn't mention anything about cryptocurrency or Monero **until the monero community started vote brigading my comment!** It was originally at 20 upvotes and they started walking it down to 6-7. So I posted a note about it and called them out. It then jumped back up to 20 and Flenst felt he needed to respond. So I responded to him with evidence:

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/dg1yio/system76_will_begin_shipping_2_linux_laptops_with/f3avdtp/

The post itself is rather long so I'll post it below, but the fact remains the monero community has successful abused the rules of a subreddit to **remove popular content that they don't like**.

1598603867,2,1,"Bitcoin is considered to be the very first cryptocurrency ‚Äî it appeared on the market more than 10 years ago. At that time, the mining industry was just beginning to gain momentum, and it was easy to make money from mining Bitcoin. It was enough just to download the software, install it on your computer and start mining.

But since then the situation has changed significantly ‚Äî now many people are engaged in Bitcoin mining, and it has become not so easy to make money on it. But it is still possible, and this article will show you how to mine Bitcoin profitably in 2020.

# Choose reliable equipment

Your income directly depends on the right choice of equipment. First of all, pay attention to ASICs, because they are increasingly displacing GPU rigs from the market. When choosing devices, consider the following factors:

* How much do you pay for electricity and how much does an ASIC consume per terahash? Choose the device that consumes the minimum. Otherwise, you will have to spend most of your income on paying your electricity bills.
* What overclocking profiles are available and how much power does the ASIC need to reach them? Choose the model that will allow you to achieve the maximum hashrate, while consuming as little as possible.
* How easy is it to get spare parts for an ASIC and have it repaired in your city? Choose a device that can be ‚Äúput back in line‚Äù as quickly as possible, as prolonged repairs mean equipment downtime and loss of profit.

Pay attention to the following models:

* Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro (hashrate up to 110 TH/s and energy saving up to 29,5 J/Th);
* Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro (easy to overclock, high reliability);
* Old generations of Bitmain Antminer –¢17 (easy to overclock, high durability);
* Innosilicon T3 (an improved cooling system).

# Take care of ventilation and cooling

ASICs consume a lot of energy, and almost all of it is converted into heat. If devices overheat, their chips will suffer, which will negatively affect hashrate and your income. Accordingly, in order to mine Bitcoin profitably and without downtime, you need to take care of ventilation and cooling.

* Clean your devices from dust regularly ‚Äî clean ASICs are less likely to overheat.
* Make sure that the room is ventilated enough ‚Äî if possible, open windows and doors, and install fans, directing them so that the airflow will remove the heat generated by the ASICs from the room.
* Do not install devices too close to each other. Leave some space between them for better ventilation.
* Try immersion cooling (immersing devices in a container of dielectric fluid). Using this method, you can eliminate the purchase of air conditioners and cut costs.

# Join the [pool](https://hiveon.net/)

By mining Bitcoin on a pool, not individually, you will receive payments more often, which means that your income will be much more stable. When choosing a pool, consider the following factors:

* Payout model (the most profitable option is PPS+, which means that you will receive a payment for each share that you submit);
* Pool fee;
* Transaction fees;
* Proximity of servers (the closer the server is, the more stable the mining process and, accordingly, your income are).

# Install custom Hiveon ASIC firmware

At the moment, profitable Bitcoin mining is almost impossible without custom firmware, and [Hiveon ASIC](https://hiveos.farm/asic) is the best available option:

* Using the downvolting function, you can reduce your energy consumption and cut costs on paying electricity bills. For example, on the stock firmware ASIC Antminer S17E consumes 2700 kW, while the hashrate is 60 TH/s. With the Hiveon ASIC firmware, the device consumes much less power (1314 kW), and the hashrate remains at the same level.
* Thanks to the overclocking function, you will be able to achieve a higher hashrate and increase your income.
* The temperature watchdog reboots the ASIC or stops the mining process if it reaches a critical point, so your devices don't overheat.
* You can also set up the desired temperature of the chips. The temperature will be maintained automatically, which will positively affect their performance.
* The hashrate watchdog reboots the device if the hashrate drops below normal. This will help you to avoid loss of profit.
* The autotuning function adjusts the frequencies of the chips to increase the hashrate and maintain the level of power consumption. This is especially useful for chips that are already worn out ‚Äî they will last longer and still be nearly as effective as full-fledged working chips.
* Thanks to the built-in wattmeter, you will always be aware of how much electricity your ASICs consume.
* With the Hiveon ASIC firmware, you can use the [Hive OS](https://hiveos.farm/) monitoring and management system for free. In this way, you will cut your costs and be able to manage thousands of devices at the same time.

As you can see, profitable Bitcoin mining is still possible even in 2020. To do this, you need to responsibly approach the matter of choosing equipment, provide devices with ventilation and cooling, join the pool and improve the devices with custom firmware.",CryptoMarkets,How to mine Bitcoin profitably in 2020

2) If you have sufficient capital to back these positions with leverage without getting liquidated, is it as simple as whatever leverage you are using is how much additional profits you'd get? e.g. 10x leverage means the profit for this trade would be magnified by 10x?

&gt; *Etherscan don't show Holders and Transactions, as they don't exists but, in fact, they're existing and, moreover, confirmed by Ethereum decentralized consensus.*

But that‚Äôs just sort of a band aid that they figured out how to hide balances. The real privacy comes through the **Bermuda API**, when you send a transaction (https://buccapi.eth), make sure you have metamask or some other web3 friendly wallet format available for it.

For now, BUCC is the number one privacy solution and its market cap is around only 200k right now, barely marketed and barely heard about.

It gets sweeter though, a lot of lovely folks like to claim you can track TXs through an Ethereum node by scooping up all interacted with addresses, but with the private wallet and GSN, you can self-whitelist through the private wallet. **Right now, sending a transaction through BUCC‚Äôs api is 100% private and it‚Äôs API is serverless and literally BUCC, it is a smart contract.**

1609148113,2,1," An incoming Senator believes bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt.  
Senator-elect Cynthia Lummis told the What Bitcoin Did podcast that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and she plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt when she assumes office in January. The senator, reportedly said, ""If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with any regard to any fiat currency...there is a backstop available to every government in the world and that backstop is bitcoin,"" Lummis said.  
The senator-elect also said that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money because the cryptocurrency's supply is finite. Bitcoin is indeed the currency of the 21st century, gone is the era of plastic money which has several flaws (e.g. being centralized and traceable). The Blockchain has several innovative dapps like online decentralized casino, [EarnBet](https://play.earnbet.io/) which seeks to overthrow traditional casinos, Chain-link which has untamperable oracle services, and best of all, Ethereum which allows developers to create an app using its technology. Recently, even Coca-Cola expressed an interest in using its mainnet, showing its untapped potential and massive application.  
Lastly, bitcoin is inflation-proof and there is a direct correlation between an economy's inflation and the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, a decent population of Venezuela uses cryptocurrencies as they have finally realized how 'redundant' fiat is and inflation can distort is function of acting as money, i.e. serving as a store of value. The pump is only getting started!

But what if a year comes around and I decide to sell my BTC for long term capital gains? With LIFO I would have to sell all my new BTC buys, and THEN sell my old BTC stack.

Another option is Specific Share ID where I would have to keep document of my 'buys, sells, date, time' which would be an alternative option. What does that form look like?

PLEASE READ and UPDOOT!!üöÄ

I recently came across a post describing how Dogecoin was made to lose value and due to the amount of coins produced daily that it is virtually impossible to keep the price stable let alone actually grow. 

The current circulating supply is over 128 Billion!!!! That is an absolutely insane amount of coins.

I myself love the doge community and think it would be the greatest thing ever if a meme coin ended up being used as the first world currency. But if there are literally thousands of coins being produced an hour and continuously pushing the price down it seems impossible to require millions of dollars to pour in just to keep the coin stable. 

I offer a simple solution, Garlic Coin!! Garlic Coin is another Meme currency created on reddit but the one major difference it only had a circulating supply of 62million!!!!! If half the money that is in doge was in Garlic we would have to be taken serious by the rest of the crypto community as the price would be over $300 a coin.

This is just an opinion and I do hold Doge as well as Garlic in roughly equal amounts, I just want us to choose the coin that is most likely to achieve stability and actual use. 

Sorry for the long text and I will attach the post I saw that made me think of this  and I look forward to all your opinions, Long Live Meme Coins!!!!!!",CryptoMarkets,DOGCOIN MODS KEEP DELETING

It combines several DeFi applications into a single ecosystem: a cross-blockchain asset gateway (wrapper), an on-blockchain¬†liquidity pool (swap), a blockchain asset vault, a perpetual contract trading platform (perp) and a decentralized governance organization DAO.

It was created by the co founder of the NEO blockchain itself, Da Hongfei.

Its unique in that it combines multiple decentralized finance tools for NEO into 1 ecosystem and its governed by users in a DAO. It is the main DEFI project on Neo.

What is most bullish about this projects is that it has a solid usecase and its a cool project with great usability for one of the ""competitors to ETH"" and the tokenomics, now this ks where it gets serious.

Tokenomics. This coin has a supply of 150,000,000 that is 150 million and it is priced at 70 cents atm. And has a market cap of 91K
Now to put this into perspective.
Eth has 115 million supply - 1700$
BNB 155 million supply - 280$
PanCake 145 million - 16 $
Nano 133 million - priced, 4.8 $

Now in my opinion this wont go into top 100 any time soon but top 150 is possible.
The NEO blockchain is not the most used and usually out of the spotlight.
But FLM being so new (launched around September 2020) and the main Defi project on Neo i think this will be pumped nicely, considering the DEFI hype and the community behind NEO.

Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1. ¬† Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2. ¬† Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3. ¬† New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world. This is super fascinating and now one of the best times to be.

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.",CryptoMarkets,Why DeFi Is More Than A Ponzi Scam :D

Many people are fascinated with investing in cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrency can indeed and can be very fun and profitable when done correctly and with a little added luck. However, investing in cryptocurrency can just as easily go bad as it can go easy if you don‚Äôt follow the right set of steps and best practices when you start to invest in cryptocurrency.

Talking about all this, XcelLab has introduced its very own Defi token, XcelDefi(XLD). The XcelDefi is the next-generated decentralized finance token (BEP-20) which is built on Binance Smart Chain to disrupt the traditional financial system. It is the governance token of XcelSwap decentralized exchange which is launching soon, where the users can swap cryptocurrencies in a public decentralized network while being anonymous and without depending on financial institutions.

Let me give you a meaningful reason to invest in XcelDefi. It comes with the best use-cases and huge potential with low market cap coins. One of the amazing features of $XLD is that you can book flights over 450+ and book hotels over 2.3 million all over the globe, Top-up for mobile plans, buy gifts cards, staking, Leading, Borrowing, Yield Farming. In contrast, it offers secured decentralized services, reliability, team proof network, and transparent accounting. This is why XcelDefi matters most in this very world of cryptocurrency where there are many emerging cryptos and donuts among various new investors. Besides all this, it‚Äôs the fastest, risk-free and trustworthy and moreover, it is expected to be the next Gem in the PancakeSwap too. 

The XcelDefi token seems genuine and promising. I personally feel like it‚Äôs a great opportunity to own Xceldefi which has this much potential. Considering its use-cases and huge potential I'm pretty sure it will boom and rise into the top 5 market cap. Hurry up !! fill your bag with XcelDefi. This is just the beginning yet more to come.

1630219748,1,1,"Basically it‚Äôs marketed as a reward system for trading or using their platform. With more money invested or on a futures account you then get a higher ‚Äúmining‚Äù bonus. Which stormgain describe to be ‚Äúcloud mining‚Äù. Which is a touchy topic even today with cloud mining being a very debatable one even with people saying poolin is a scam :/ 

I must add this this ‚Äúmining‚Äù on stormgain IS NOT REAL MINING Why? The funds can only be used on their platform to trade with! Does this mean the BTC is not real or simulated or it‚Äôs a USDT balance not really BTC or anything else we‚Äôll likely not.

As I have only heard good reviews from people who have used it and claimed the mining funds to trade with ok Stormgain and then make profit to then transfer to their binance account or any wallet or even cash out on stormgain itself.
This may help answer those who have not looked or tried to withdraw to a trading account when you reach a $10 USD ‚Äúmining balance‚Äù to transfer into your trading account of which IF you make a or any profits over $10USD in the Trading account THAT is yours to keep cash out or actually invest or trade it as your own finance. 

This can be done instantly, I mean for the having a balance over $10USD in the mining account (for August 2021 the code is ‚ÄúBONUS25‚Äù that granted me $20 USD in BTC the $5 reduction was due to the price change of Bitcoin since the start of August code to when I claimed in mid August.

I was able to transfer to a trading account but I have not use it to trade as I am still learning and studying finacial markets and risk management. The miner for anyone who has less than 75k invested is the same as if you have $0 invested or deposits on future account. 

Second note is with the trading funds that are sent over and then used from the Miner they will always be a base balance of your account that can get gains with but can also be lost but being that you were given it or ‚Äúmined‚Äù clicked a button that either does connect to their mining servers or not it still gives you BTC that‚Äôs on the market so it has to be mined from some where at some point. This is also a way the company can grow its own market value that said I have heard so many mixed opinions on this ‚ÄúCrypto Miner by StormGain‚Äù the only problem is the negatives are people that mine or know about mining crypto and have not ever used or dowloaded to try and transfer funds from the StormGain Mining Account to their Spot Trading account and then execute trades on the live market with the ‚ÄúMined‚Äù or ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù Bitcoin when you have $10 or more in the miner balance you can withdraw but I recommend saving up for $30 or having use the bonus code for August and have $20-$25 balance with a monthly earn rate of $15 USD if you click the mining button every 4 hours 2-3 times a day.",CryptoMarkets,StormGain and it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrypto Mining‚Äù in app section that can be used on SG markets only is it legit?

My goal is to ride the altcoin bull run and maybe restructure and go heavy on BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, LINK &amp; DOT after BTC dominance is picking up again.

What coin should I add/remove/change $ allocation?

Thanks guys.

At this point, eth will flip bitcoin and gradually bitcoin dominance will decrease as investors look at greener pastures. Eventually people will stop being nostalgic about btc and jump ship completely. By now bitcoin has stopped being volatile, which means growth prospects have shrunk. A major reason for low volatility in this era of bitcoin is because more nation states have adopted it. PaxG is the new digital gold, backed by real gold. Bitcoin is just old school digital money. Algorand and Cardano are also stable sovereign currencies. The real growth now comes from gaming, shopping and other consumption tokens. The year is 2030.",CryptoMarkets,"Unpopular opinion, but well"

There's a project that has been developing the infrastructure to enable DAOs on a way that gives them the most utility.

In the process they created a new token standard that encapsulates a few of the others.  It does things like allow dynamic metadata changes in NFTs.  Like you earn an enchantment on you in game sword and want to apply it to one your sword nft. It can rewrite the data on that nft without remint... There's a lot of other more technical things to it.

They also created an amm and a really good structure for creating DAOs that all work together.  

Nftbunny just announced a project they are launching using the new standard.

The last 3 years they see spoke at edcon next to projects like aave gitcoin and vitalik himself so it is some what vetted.  I believe vitalik is big on DAOs and this project is meant to give them pretty big utility...

1638696300,7,1,"Well I believe that today, the situation changed a little bit. I mean governance tokens now do have better use cases, and are undoubtedly more popular than before. First of all, it‚Äôs important to know that governance tokens are one of the reasons why DeFi is still going strong, let‚Äôs not forget that the holders of these tokens, with their voting power, are helping distributing the rights to users in order to keep the decentralization.

Also, the demand of governance tokens is increasing year after year. Personally, I see that this is one positive sign. It shows that investors are loving to have an opinion on what‚Äôs to come to the projects they‚Äôre participating in. What I like the most about this kind of cryptocurrency is that we, as investors will be having a direct influence on the decision making. I mean, I‚Äôd love to be able to express how I prefer the project to use the dev funds. 

And just as I said above, the use case of these cryptocurrencies are evolving. I mean it‚Äôs not only about voting, they allow investors to stake and yield farm. So it‚Äôs clear that these tokens are moving forward. Also, with the growth of DeFi, the demand of this kind of tokens is increasing, which lead to more projects adopting to this style. One of the promising DeFi projects is coming next Thursday on Sushiswap‚Äôs Miso. It‚Äôs called New Order DAO (NEWO), and expected to launch around 30-40 DeFi projects, starting next year. 

So yes, what I want to say is that DAOs and governance tokens aren‚Äôt fairly rated, and don‚Äôt receive the praise they deserve. However, I do believe they still have a lot to offer in the upcoming few years as they still didn‚Äôt fulfil their entire potential.",CryptoMarkets,"If someone told us a few years ago that governance tokens will be leading the way in DeFi and other cryptocurrency projects you probably wouldn‚Äôt continue the conversation, right?"

Since I was one of the buyers of Aurora at the launch, I have always followed this project and its ecosystem. 

Recently a DEX called WannaSwap appeared on the Aurora blockchain. Its special feature is that it uses a certain fund to pay a commission within its network, thereby making the exchange free for all participants!

Can you imagine? Swap, adding liquidity, and farming are all free. I don't know how long it will last but at the moment you can get farming at 1000+ percent APR.

In order to use WannaSwap, you have to use Rainbow Bridge. 

How did I do it? First I buy NEAR at some exchange (Gate is better) then I transfer NEAR to Aurora ecosystem with Rainbow Bridge and then just swap to WannaSwap. It's very simple)

By the way, the WANNA token is trading at X14 of its original price, but that's just the beginning.

Most beginners won‚Äôt get this, and actually, won‚Äôt care. The platforms you use matters, and it makes a difference. It makes a difference when the platform has control over you, whether or not you can see that control is irrelevant. 

For a nasty example, take RH. They literally cornered their users and forced them out of profit and literally removed the buy button, that‚Äôs how manipulative they can get. I understand that their reasons were different and at the time it was a special case, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter, what they did showed one thing: the platform you use has the ultimate control and the final say. Be wary when you give them this power over you and your funds. 

I honestly, personally, prefer DeFi exchanges. Especially those that are open-sourced and have nothing to hide. I thought this was the whole point of cryptocurrency to begin with. To take control away from a select few? I honestly have my money diversified over a number of DeFi exchanges like Werewolf and others, and I feel this is the most secure way to protect myself and my assets.

TLDR; platforms matter, proprietary ones have ultimate control and will not hesitate to use it, DeFi gives control back to you.

For the time being, it appears that Facebook is attempting to profit on a mostly unexplored market by propelling it ahead. Only time will tell whether or not it is eventually successful. However, I do not believe it will be able to replace the internet. It can't work without the internet. VR may one day evolve to the point where it is either an alternative to or an evolution of the internet as we know it.
In video games, the first Metaverse was discovered. Because there was no internet linking them, they didn't have a linked, social media experience yet. They may be found in arcades and with Atari at home. The internet was the name of the next metaverse, which was the internet itself. It's still going strong, and you may have heard of it. As you might expect, the two worlds collided, and we got Second Life, Minecraft, and, more recently, Fortnite over two decades ago. This is a metaverse. It's a world of social media.
There are many projects specialising in each category, such as decentraland and the sandboc, which are video games with a high chance of marketing and publicity, alienworld, which is a virtual reality version of an adventure sport, and metakawn, which is a metaverse specifically designed for the Muslim community with a hallal ecosystem.

As the climate problem intensifies, I believe that the most ecologically friendly crypto currencies will fare the best; many have already been mentioned in this thread as having promising prospects.

Literally everyone I know invested in this scam project, which offered up to 40% returns on your investment **within the month** and no one saw anything wrong I guess. 

As you must have guessed, the project quickly rug pulled everyone, as expected. It's called Binancesfund if you want to fact-check me, and no it's not related to Binance at all by no means. 

I don't understand why slow consistent gains are not a goal anymore, everyone wants that massive win high. I think years of internet abuse has fried our attention spans for instant validation and look at where we are now. 

I've got some solid investments all around; ADA MATIC ELON and even DOGE, but I always go for that +5% and never a x1000. I've, admittedly, dabbled in shitcoins before, and it was not profitable for me.

Hillary Clinton ‚ÄòDisappointed‚Äô Crypto Exchanges Are Not Blocking All Russian Users

Hillary Clinton, a former first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state, and the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, heavily criticized the Biden administration, the Treasury Department, and European governments on MSNBC Monday night for allowing Russians to use cryptocurrency as an escape route.

Commenting on some major cryptocurrency exchanges refusing to block accounts of all Russian users, Clinton said:

I was disappointed to see that some of the so-called crypto exchanges, not all of them but some of them, are refusing to end transactions with Russia for some, I don‚Äôt know, philosophy of libertarianism or whatever.

1646294957,0,1,"After Russia's ruble hit yet another record low and Moscow was slammed with further sanctions, cryptocurrency prices are surging. According to CoinDesk, bitcoin has risen 13% in the previous 24 hours to $43,163. Other cryptocurrencies have also risen in value. Ethereum rose ten percent to $2,878 on Tuesday. Dogecoin increased by roughly 6% to over 13 cents per unit. 

Virtual currencies have long been seen as a high-risk investment, but if traditional assets face restrictions or increased volatility as a result of geopolitical tensions, some analysts predict they may gain popularity. The trade volume between ruble and cryptocurrencies on Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has increased in recent days, according to Arcane Research, an Oslo-based cryptocurrency research organization. 

According to Bendik Schei, head of research at Arcane, investors appear to be ""seeking to get out of the ruble"" owing to its ""dramatic depreciation after all the penalties."" Tether, rather than bitcoin, was becoming more popular, according to Schei. While bitcoin is the most expensive cryptocurrency in the world, tether is referred to as a ""stablecoin"" since it is tied to the US dollar.

Chesky was asked if Airbnb supports crypto since some people in Ukraine are trying to take payments in cryptocurrency following Russia‚Äôs invasion. He replied:

Airbnb is. I mean, I am personally supportive of the idea of crypto, of course. I think it‚Äôs a really interesting technology.

I can't say I'm surprised at how quickly the almighty and powerful Mark Zuccerberg fell from grace, especially because I (a millennial) grew up seeing him rise to become one of the world's most powerful people with enough money to build his own nation.

 Despite this, his Facebook stocks continued to plunge at the start of this year, and his investors are increasingly diverting their funds away from the project in favor of bigger and better things, particularly in light of the recent cryptocurrency explosion.

It's gaining steam quickly, and more people are flocking to it in the hopes of getting a piece of such a lucrative opportunity, all under the name of a man who established one of Silicon Valley's greatest online empires. Despite his previous blunders, there's a reason why people trust his judgment. Because he has been successful in the past, and if fate has it his way, he may be successful again.

It's only natural to reflect on Facebook's failings now that the company and site are entirely old and out of use. When was the last time you heard someone say they were on Facebook? Unless it's a baby boomer or someone much older...

The Metaverse, on the other hand, is gaining popularity, particularly among young teenagers and their classmates. People I know are selling what they have in order to buy in a little area of the Metaverse, demonstrating how successful it may be in the future.

Its success is based not only on its brilliant marketing abilities, but also on what new ideas it can inspire in the future. I've already seen a lot of enterprises spring up to fill the voids it has created in the market. Consider the Metaverse 7, a platform with a variety of services, including NFT gaming and the tokenization of the gaming industry.

1647077154,0,1,,CryptoMarkets,"To take profit or not to take profit is a dilemma that many crypto traders struggle with. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no easy answer to this question as the future is unknown. But there is a proven way to make the most out of your decisions, take a look!"
1647591250,0,1,"I don't know why people in the crypto are so greedy, it's like all those massive pumps all those years have literally ruined our expectations so much that we can't go for a small marginal gain with safety and will literally bankrupt ourselves going for that next 100x, which almost always end up being total and complete rug pulls or scams.

There's a deep relation between massive massive pumps and scams, no established coin should be pumping that hard. We need to get ourselves a little reality check fr man.

I see people all the time complaining about how Bitcoin will only ever do 2x in x number of years. I don't know why we've literally been ruined to believe that 2x is not a lot, trust me, it's a lot.

I mean you won't find a chance to turn your 100 dollars into a million in an established coin, these coins are literally built to go slow and steady. Take for example Bitcoin and Ethereum, that have a number of mechanisms that will make them deflationary, and will complicate their mining, and will have their rewards, all in the name of making their value actually relevant to the amount of work it takes to mine them...

This is the whole point of mining, that the asset remains almost equal to the price it requires to extract it. This is the methodology gold was built upon, and this is the same theory Bitcoin is trying to build.

If you want a 100x you should be looking at memecoins like ELON or something rather than ADA or Matic or something that is meant to serve the function of having a utility.

Profit is profit at the end of the day and I get people being impatient, but please get a reality check",CryptoMarkets,"Reality check, we will probably never see 100x off an established coin again"

I am looking for projects that will be here in 10 years and have a real life impact. There are plenty of projects that have this potential, but that gives you the next dilemma: What is the project really worth? 

Coming from a Finance background I like to value a project, which is sometimes difficult in Crypto. Just saying the price will go to $1, $ 10 $1000 or the Moon is not a real metric I would like to rely on. 

I have been using a Discounted Cash Flow model, which can be applied on projects with enough transparency, actual business model and something that could be considered as a Cash Flow. This way I can make a rational decision in investing.

As an example I applied this to **GET Protocol** (NFT Ticketing Project), each ticket sold uses a certain amount of $GET, while the supply is capped. This usage can be seen as a Cash Flow and used in your model. For more on the project I can recommend this blog:

[https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd](https://medium.com/coinmonks/nfts-are-much-more-than-just-jpegs-99c20cd963fd)

If supernets is Polygon Edge on steroids as claimed, then imagine what how much of value does it add.

Now what‚Äôs interesting is Polygon will be investing up to $100 million in projects that are interested in increasing their growth through Polygon Supernets chain. For all the devs out there, i mean what more could you ask for?

Put aside that I‚Äôm a huge Matic fan, to be honest, all I can describe this is to be a winning situation for everyone, investors, developers, and tech lovers.

1654072363,0,1,"As some backstory, I worked 48 hours a week and there are times I get severely stressed and there are times I get high fevers. Even if I am not feeling well, people at the company tell me to show up or don't bother coming in anymore. I didn't have a choice; I couldn't find another job, so I put up with it all because I needed to pay my bills and eat.

That job was a mental nightmare for me every day. The whole company itself is toxic. Before I resigned, I made sure I had enough and invested some crypto and stocks and mutual funds. Fast forward today I found a better high paying job that was loads better than my previous job. Not only that, my crypto earnings had increased even better than my stocks and mutual funds.

With crypto, I want to secure myself and my family with pride. I never want to be in a situation where I have no choice but to put up with anything, and I'm hoping that crypto can help me with that. I also want to invest long term and make sure I don‚Äôt get emotional with the roller coaster ride with all the dips that have been happening in various cryptos. I was an early investor and fortunately it didn't affect me.

I admit there are times where there my thoughts are divided between HODLING or Staking my crypto with [defi protocols](https://app.aave.com/) and/or [crypto staking platforms](https://haruinvest.com/) till I'm confident to rely on my earnings, as well as whatever my future family will be OR selling it off because of the dip (and the news about LUNA) and start living a luxurious life showing off my nice house and new car but I learned that not letting people know your ups and downs of financial status is a lot better.

I'm attempting to train myself to work smarter rather than harder. I just want to get out of this cycle of poverty where I spend the majority of my income on bills, food and the endless cycle of living from paycheck to paycheck.",CryptoMarkets,My goal with crypto is to have a secure life with me and my family and get out of poverty.

Liquidity pools hold a significant place in facilitating digital asset conversion with maximum speed and convenience. A liquidity pool is, essentially, a tool that allows Liquidity Providers (LP) to lock their assets in a smart contract and, in return, make a profit off of various fees. These incentives are also known as Liquidity Provider Tokens (LPT). Anyone can become a Liquidity Provider. LPs act as middlemen in performing trades. The earnings they make are then spread out proportionally among all LPs in the pool. All in all, the more locked tokens a pool has, the better liquidity it facilitates, leading to easier and more robust trades.

Liquidity pools have drastically transformed the decentralized finance sector by offering simplified and convenient digital asset transactions and making it possible for users to generate a passive income via the new technology.

The emergence of liquidity pools was an unquestionable necessity, which has massively contributed to raising awareness of [DeFi](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-defi/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) among investors. However, the technology is yet to be improved. For instance, the concept of Liquidity Providers may potentially undermine the decentralized approach. There could also be a risk of fraud and hacking exploits.

Nevertheless, the liquidity pool is a powerful tool and the underlying technology for many [dApps](https://getblock.io/blog/what-is-a-dapp-everything-you-need-to-know-about-dapps/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) used by millions of [crypto](https://getblock.io/blog/why-crypto-market-dip-may-be-good-for-web3-development/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo) enthusiasts and professionals on a daily basis, therefore there‚Äôs a high likelihood the technology will continue to grow and improve.",CryptoMarkets,Liquidity Pools Pros and Cons

With that being said, I feel like a LOT of the projects on Luna had so much potential and would have grown to become really popular ones in the market.

Loop Finance was very legit and while Mirror protocol had its controversies, later on, it was a very solid project in its own right.

And these are just the big names that stand out. There‚Äôs a huge list of projects that got duped and that was pretty sad to witness.

Although there‚Äôs some good news that a lot of these projects are moving out of the Terra ecosystem and finding a home for them on other chains.  
The most prominent right now is Polygon with more than 48 Terra based projects already moving there which I think is smart cause Polygon is known to be one of the easiest chains to build on with more than 20,000 dApps and 6,000 monthly active builder teams already on there.

This and the fact that it‚Äôs very EVM compatible so these Terra based projects can now benefit from technically being part of the Ethereum ecosystem in some way or another.

I really hope that these projects still keep some sort of their identity though and not get rebranded into something completely different. I think everyone would love to see Terra based projects still survive and make it after the disaster that struck their mother blockchain.",CryptoMarkets,Such a shame how Do Kwon and Anchor did Terra Luna dirty.

1658740483,0,1,"With the crypto bear market happening, There are a lot of crypto companies that are affected by the bear market. The worst that got affected was Celsius which just recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

While the majority of crypto companies are joining the firing frenzy, some are not. There's Nexo only making use of overcollateralized loans, which are by definition sustainable. They are extremely cautious and have no involvement in high-risk DeFi projects which is key to why they survived the bear market. There's also Haru Invest which is very different from other CeFi services. They don't place their customer's funds in DeFi or other platforms. They have an actual arbitration/trading product that is true and tested. And then there‚Äôs also Whalefin landing a major Kit Sponsorship Deal With Spanish Atletico Madrid.

Although a global pandemic is much worse than a recession, the markets managed to survive it. Only the bad players are usually weeded out while the good players stay.

The situation is not nearly as bad as a global pandemic, despite the fact that inflation is bad and we are in a recession. Even then, the markets eventually recovered after hitting a bottom at a very basic macro support. A recession, fluctuating interest rates, and inflation are all perfectly normal aspects of an economic cycle.

Crypto reacts much more quickly than stocks. Stocks are elderly men trying to cross the street, while crypto is a squirrel on crack. By the time stocks have finished pumping or dumping, crypto has already crossed over. That applies both ways, and history suggests that a bottom will form before stock prices do as well.

This whole thing is basically just a roller coaster ride and you are in it. There will be good and bad times. It‚Äôs up to you if you‚Äôll continue to join the ride.",CryptoMarkets,Should you use crypto companies or services with the bear market happening?

No analogy beats the analogy of Andreas Antonopoulos where he intelligently espoused on the current world financial position in a 38 minutes video. He captioned it [""the ships are sinking""](https://youtu.be/stN03wk_Wzs)

How I wish he went further to tell us about some of the fast, effective and durable speed boats &amp; life boats that people can run to right now. 

Although, I have an idea what a life boat or speed boat should be because any crypto that can still do well in these dips can be likened to a life boats or speed boats. 

Like for instance how many bear markets has @Earnbet- [$BET](http://earnbet.io/?bonus=ez0746551279327093) token survived ? Dev didn't sell... Even top investors didn't sell. [EarnBetCasino](http://earnbet.io/?bonus=ez0746551279327093) obviously is on a mission that is not primarily money driven. And guess they're working so hard to organically increase the value of $BET in no time and gamers experience on the gaming platform.  They're prepping for their third year anniversary and am already looking out for the launching of spot games, NFTs and other web3.0 propositions.

$CRO from [crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)
 is also a very good life boat right now, although they are not very good with marketing right now but if the fundamental is right nothing can go wrong, the $CRO team is silently building, they recently burned over 65% of its total supply.
