You have to accept the fact that fiat value of your portfolio is constantly changing. It can go XY% up or down on a daily basis. Sounds pretty obvious right? Well guess what. Some people are still not able to deal with this. That’s why they’re panicking and checking the prices every 5 minutes. It messes with your head. Trust me I know what I’m talking about coz I had the exact problem few years ago. You have to develop a mindset of a gardener to be able to accept the short term volatility. At the end of the day, time in the market beats timing the market. I know, you’ve probably heard it a thousand times before. Just don’t let it consume you. I believe in you.

1624107916,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o3foxr/do_you_want_to_learn_to_code_and_become_a_crypto/,527,76,"Hi all,

As per the title, I'm planning to learn to write code, with the intention of becoming more involved in the growing world of crypto, and more specifically DeFi. I'm taking a guess that there might be other people wanting to do the same and so thought I'd propose a kind of mutual motivation study group.

I've been aware of crypto for a few years, but other than some investments, throwing the occasional donation to Gitcoin grants and trying to share some opinions with the crypto community in various places I haven't been that involved. A situation that I'm sure I'm not alone in.

My goals are to learn to develop dApps and contribute to the infrastructure that this new ecosystem is being built on, the barrier to this goal is my negligible knowledge of programming. My background is in physics and as such I've had to learn a few tiny scraps of Python, but I've used this so infrequently that it's really just trial and error. Effectively my knowledge level is zero. What I want to be able to do eventually is understand Solidity and probably JavaScript well enough that I can have a chance at deploying smart contracts that do what I expect them to do and therefore be part of building the DeFi future. In a dream success scenario I can eventually transition to working for a DAO, being paid on the blockchain as a developer!

If that sounds similar to your position; if you're starting to feel like you want more from crypto than just speculating on the changing value of assets or moving liquidity around between pools; or even if you just want to be able to read smart contracts well enough to improve your chances of assessing possible projects to invest in, then please comment below.


A lot of the inspiration for doing this comes from the excellent resource list posted by u/SolorMining at: https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5jz6w/want_to_become_a_crypto_developer_here_is_a_list/ . Much credit for his or her contributions!

From that list I've put together a rough plan for study. This is based on roughly 10h per week, which is what I have previously been able to set aside for part time, home based learning. If there's lots of interest from people with different amounts of time then we can change the timings, or have different study groups moving at different paces etc. I've also not checked all of these courses for prerequisite knowledge or overlap, so there might be a much more logical order! Please let me know if this is the case! Anyway, here's a draft timeline:

It's so frustrating that some of us have to liquidate a part of our current investment holdings, and thus, lowering our overall future ROI, just so we can pay someone who risked none of his own money his share of the pie.

I am all for paying taxes. It's only right that we pay for the safety and conveniences that our country have given us, but taxing crypto to crypto transactions is just stealing. Crypto to crypto transactions is not capital gains! We should not treat crypto gains like fiat gains because we simply can't walk into a convenient store and make a purchase with the majority of cryptocurrencies that are currently available on the market. It should still be considered within the realm of a long term investments holdings until we cash out to fiat. It's only fair that we're taxed, only, when we cash out to fiat and into our bank accounts where we can actually spend it . Until then, it shouldn't be taxed at all!

It's frustrating because some of us have yet have the privilege to enjoy our investments in its fiat form, and here we are selling off some of our holdings, cutting into our future overall ROI, putting our dreams on hold, just so we can pay Uncle Sam his share of our hard earned money on a risk that we, ourselves, took. It's wrong on so many level. The US government should reconsider only taxing cryptocurrency investments after it gets liquidated into it's fiat form and into our bank accounts where it'll be spent as part of our income. Until then, Uncle Sam is just being a bully, and what we're sacrificing to pay this bully is just BS. We're giving you your fair share of the pie, Uncle Sam! All we ask is to be fair to us in return, too, please!

Or maybe that was during the last halvening cycle.  Anyway, let's focus on the corrections rather than the timing:  Each of those corrections was at least 30%.  Some were in the range of 70-80%, and a few have been close to 90%.

I think we've just gone through another one of those crashes. 

""Wait,"" you say.  ""It only dropped about 50% from ATH.""

That's correct, so why would I call this a 70% crash, when it isn't?  Simple:  Institutional involvement (and partial maturation of the crypto markets) means less volume trading hands during sell-offs (measured in terms of coins, not in terms of value).  Maturation and institutional participation means a smoothing of peaks and valleys.  Crashes will not be as big as they have been in the past.

If there wasn't the current level of institutional involvement in BTC, I think the current months-long selloff could have been a much deeper valley.

For those of you who have held through the recent sell-off of the past few months (probably most of you), then congratulations, you deserve the ""steel hands"" award.  But I think we'll see very few crashes of &gt;70% in overall crypto markets in the future.  You may never get a true diamond hands award for holding through a 90% bloodbath.

Nobody really knows what's going to happen next; we might be in a short-term dip that is nearly over, or a major extended dip, or even the beginnings of a bear market. I am not here to try to convince you of any of these possibilities, nor to compel you to take profits, or hold, or buy. I simply want to present some facts about the major dips that have occurred previously during bull runs for you to use as a basis to help you draw your own conclusions about where we are now.

If you don't want to read through all of this (kind of repetitive) information, feel free to skip ahead to the conclusion to see the averages of all the data, and my final takeaway.

So, we are currently **5 days** into a significant dip in the price of Bitcoin (and therefore basically every other cryptocurrency). 5 days ago, BTC reached an all-time high. Since then, it has reached a local low that is about **23%** down from the ATH.

Let’s take a look at all the dips during bull runs that have seen 20% or more decrease from the ATH peak directly preceding the dip (this is the 9th such dip in BTC history).

**Bull run of 2010-2011**

The bull run of 2010-2011 included 3 dips during the runup that were 20% dips or greater, and which followed ATHs.

**November 6, 2010:** A dip began after we reached an ATH on November 6 during the first BTC bull run. The lowest point of this dip was reached **1 month and 3 days** later, at **50% down**. **2 months and 8 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that occurred at the beginning of the dip (ie: it took 2 months and 8 days to fully recover from the dip). **3 months and 3 days** after the dip began, we reached our next peak. In other words, the crest-to-crest wavelength of the dip was 3 months and 3 days.

**February 12, 2011**: 3 months and 3 days after the previous peak, a new ATH was reached on February 11, which was followed by the next major dip. This dip reached a low **1 month and 22 days** after it began, falling by **37%**. **2 months and 4 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that occurred at the beginning of the dip, and thus could be considered fully recovered. The wavelength between the peak at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak was **3 months and 1 day**.

**May 13, 2011**: 3 months and 1 day after the previous peak, a new dip began following the ATH on May 13. This dip reached its low only **7 days** after it began, falling by **31%**. Only **12 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC recovered past the ATH at the beginning of the dip. The wavelength between the peak at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak (which was the final peak of the 2011 bull run) was **26 days**. 

**Bull run of 2013**

The 2013 bull run is a bit out of an outlier. This is because there is no major dip anywhere during the entire runup, except for one massive correction that took almost 7 months to recover. This correction is so big that you could easily argue it was a mini bear run, surrounded on two sides by mini bull runs. Whether you see 2013 as containing two mini bull runs and a mini bear run, or just one full-sized bull run with a gigantic correction in it, is up to you. At the end of this post when I aggregate the data and calculate the averages, I'll do a version that includes this data point and another version that doesn't. Here are the details for this giant correction:

**April 9, 2013:** Following the new ATH reached on April 9th, a major dip occurred that bottomed out **2 months and 27 days** after it began, reaching **72% down**. The price of BTC recovered and surpassed the ATH **6 months and 26 days** after it began. The wavelength between the peak at the start of the correction and the subsequent peak (which was the final peak of the entire 2013 run) was **7 months and 27 days**.

**Bull run of 2017-2018**

During the bull run of 2017/2018, there were 4 dips of 20% or more that occurred after an ATH was reached.

**March 3, 2017:** A dip began after we reached an ATH on March 3rd. The lowest point of this dip was reached **21 days** later, at about **27% down**. **1 month and 23 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that occurred at the beginning of the dip. The wavelength between the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak was **3 months and 9 days**. 

**June 11, 2017**: 3 months and 9 days after the previous peak, a new ATH was reached on June 11, which was followed by the next major dip. This dip reached a low **1 month and 5 days** after it began, falling by **36%**. **1 month and 24 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that occurred at the beginning of the dip. The wavelength between the peak at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak was **2 months and 20 days**.

**September 1, 2017:** 2 months and 20 days after the previous peak, a new ATH was reached on September 1, which was followed by the next major dip. This dip reached a low **13 days** after the dip began, falling by **34%**. **1 month and 11 days** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that occurred at the beginning of the dip. The wavelength between the peak at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak was **2 months and 7 days**.

**November 8th, 2017:** 2 months and 7 days after the previous peak, a new ATH was reached on November 8, followed by the final major dip of the 2017/2018 bull run. This dip reached its lowest point only **4 days** after it began, bottoming out at **22% down**. Only **7 days** after this dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the ATH that was reached at the beginning of the dip, making it **by far the fastest major dip during a BTC bull run to recover** (the only other big bull run dip that was even close to being this short was the final dip in the 2010-2011 run; notably, both of these quick dips were the final dips before the true peaks of their respective bull runs). The wavelength between the peak at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent peak (which was the final peak of the bull run) was **1 month and 8 days**.

**Current bull run**

**January 8, 2021:** We have already had one major dip this bull run, following the ATH that was reached on January 8th. The lowest point in this dip came **19 days** later, when the price of BTC was about **25% down** from the preceding peak. Exactly **one month** after the dip began, the price of BTC surpassed the price it had peaked at before the dip. The wavelength between the crest at the beginning of the dip and the subsequent crest (which is the ATH we saw 5 days ago) was **1 month and 13 days**.

**Conclusion**

If we omit the 2013 ""mini bear run"" point of data, then here are the average stats for all the bull run corrections that were at least a 20% dip across Bitcoin's history:

**Average:** A **33% dip** where the low is hit **23 days** after the dip begins, and where the price recovers to what it was at the start of the dip **1 month and 11 days** after the dip begins. The wavelength of this average dip is **2 months and 7 days**.

To put this into perspective, if our current dip were to be exactly average in all these ways, then it would hit a low of about **$39,000** on the **16th of March**. It would recover to its ATH of about $58,000 on the **3rd of April**, and reach its next peak on the **29th of April**.

Here are the results if we include the gigantic dip of 2013:

**Average:** A **37% dip** where the low is hit **1 month** after the dip begins, and where the price recovers to what it was at the start of the dip **1 month and 29 days** after the dip begins. The wavelength of this average dip is **2 months and 26 days**.

To put this into perspective, if our current dip were to be exactly average in all these ways, then it would hit a low of about **$36,500** on the **23rd of March**. It would recover to its ATH of about $58,000 on the **21st of April**, and reach its next peak on the **18th of May**.

**Final takeaway:** Obviously, there is no reason to expect that the dip we are currently experiencing will resemble the average of all similar dips in the past. It might recover dramatically to the previous ATH within the next week like the final major dips in the 2011 and 2017 runs. It might follow the more common dip trajectory and complete a full recovery only in the next 3 to 5 weeks. Or we might even be entering the next bear market (though most TA, for what it's worth, suggests this is not the case).

In any case, if this correction is stressing you out, please realize that **major dips of 20%-40% during bull runs is historically common**, and that the **average time it takes to recover from such dips is almost a month and a half!**

I hope this helps somebody!

I stopped in to a local record store the other day, found a few picks, and at checkout presented my Coinbase Debit Card. Guy at the register looks at it for a moment and hands it back saying he can't accept this form of payment. I explain it's just a debit card, and if he runs it it'll be charged just like any other debit card, but he insists on not accepting it. In an extremely rare turn of events I decide to be a bit assertive (really wanted that XLM I guess) and ask if a manager is available so I can explain, and he replied that he owns the place so it's his call. I ended up using another form of payment because one of my picks was severely underpriced, but left wondering why any business owner would turn it down.

Anyone know if there was a legit reason, or was this guy just not accepting it on ""principle"" or something?

1633529271,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q2l7b0/common_misconceptions_about_market_cap/,117,86,"I see it too often in comments about market cap, either people overestimating what it means, or underestimating it. In either case, misunderstanding how it works and what it really means.

# The Myth

Here's some of the misconceptions I see the most:

\-If a market cap is at $1Trillion, that means it took $1Trillion to get to this point. That's incorrect.

\-To raise a market cap by another $100 million, it means you need $100 million of money coming in. That's incorrect.

\-Market cap determines the value of that market. That's incorrect.

\-On the other side of it, I see people say that their high market cap $2 ADA coin could go to $100. Which would make them four times Bitcoin's market cap. That's unlikely to happen.

# How it works

A market cap is not based on buy orders, how much money comes in, or anything to do with cash flow.

It's simply a formula calculating (total shares) x (price of shares).

Yes, it really is as stupid as that. There's no other element taken into account.

Latest price is the key. If there's a lot of shares bought for dirt cheap, but the last buy order decided that the price would be $1M per share, then the market cap could become astronomical.

Or you could have only 1 person buy a share and no one else, and pay $1M. If there's 1 million shares, the market cap would be $1Trillion.

For a company and its stock, market cap does still make some sense. But applying that same principle on a coin, may not make as much sense.

In crypto, it's the circulating supply multiplied by the current market price of the coin...based on fiat. This gets a little muddy as you have coins mined or issued, different caps on supply, very volatile volume, and you are pegging a currency to another currency.

To the point where you have to question if it even makes any sense to look at market caps for crypto.

# Example

One more extreme example I like to use are Moons. Earlier this year, Moons were hovering around $0.10. Until someone placed an order worth only around $15,000. Because of the ridiculously low volume and small market, the price spiked above $0.30. That was a market cap increase of over $10 Million.

But there was never $10M involved in any way. Depending on the volume, and the action of the market, you can increase the market cap of a coin without even that much money.

So yea, it's not completely impossible in theory for some shitcoin to match Bitcoin's market cap on a fluke. It's still very unlikely. But we have seen how ridiculously high ICP jumped out of nowhere in market cap within days, into the top 10.

It's also not inconceivable for Bitcoin to reach prices in the hundreds of thousands. You wouldn't actually need entire nations GDP to push the price that high.

# How to use market caps

On its own, market caps in crypto don't mean that much, but you can still make some use of them if you combine that data with other data.

You have to take into account other elements, like trading volume of a coin, minting and supply limits, some of the tokenomics like burning, etc...

And market cap should really be considered relative to other coins, preferably of similar tokenomics and appealing to a similar market.

And more importantly, be compared within cryptocurrency. Comparing the market cap of a coin to the market cap of a stock becomes very meaningless.",CryptoCurrency,Common misconceptions about market cap.

I have to remember y’all too that if you can you should keep the moons on your vault as that would make you eligible for the 20% bonus for holding for the next distribution.
Okay, but how do you actually sell them? There’s a few options out there, the first one is using Kuyumcu (just google it) but I might warn you that the conversion fees are quite high, 20-30%. To use kuyumcu you have to make a nano wallet, To do that use Natrium (available on smartphones), then you’ll have to go to kuyumcu (https://moon.nano.trade) and trade your moons for some Nano, after that it’s as simple as transferring the Nano to a reputable exchange, ( Kraken accept nano deposits if I’m not mistaken) then you do your thing there, sell it for fiat or trade for other cryptos. 


Another option is using Celesti.trade, I have recently used it and it’s fast and the fees are waaay lower than kuyumcu’s, so it might be the better option. The steps are quite similar but instead of making a Nano wallet you’ll have to make a Lumens wallet or you can receive it directly into your exchange if they accept lumens deposits.

The last option is using xDai but I’m yet to go that route so I’ll just leave a link to another redditors post regarding that.

CRO currently has the following use cases:  


* Staking on their exchange to reduce fees and also pay gas.
* Supercharger in the CDC app to ""mine"" other tokens into your portfolio.
* A dedicated CDC DeFi wallet to earn APR on CRO and many other tokens.
*  Staking for their metal debit card which gives varying cash back (per stake tier) in CRO and perks such as free Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. Also free lounge access when you fly. IMO it's one of the best deployments of any cryptocurrency card on the market right now.

1623665493,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nzji5c/europeans_should_switch_to_crypto_cashback_cards/,161,55,"**TL;DR** Given the differences between credit card perks in the US vs. Europe, Europeans should be embracing crypto cashback cards that allow you to spend fiat (not crypto) and return up to 3% cashback in crypto rewards to the user. (Cashback can go much higher than 3% if you're willing to stake a company's native token).

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest differences that I've noticed in personal finance between the US and Europe is the use of credit cards. In the US, folks with high credit scores are usually bombarded with offers from card companies that give them sizeable sign-up bonuses, completely interest free loans or balance transfers and generous cashback percentages on purchases. Speaking only about credit cards that do not charge an annual fee, a good (free) card in the US will give you around 2% cashback on all of your purchases and some even have additional perks that allow you to earn 5-6% in certain categories or during specific time frames (e.g. Q1 restaurants, Q2 online shopping). Those who are in control of their finances and do not fall victim to using their credit cards to spend beyond their means are usually able to use all of these perks to their advantage and make some money back by moving all of their spending to the card.

Europe is a quite different in this regard. While most countries have embraced plastic and you can buy pretty much anything with your credit card, the relationship that folks have with their cards is unlike the US. First of all, there is no bombardment of credit card offers in your mailbox each week. There are often no signup bonuses, or they are very small (€25). Credit limits are much lower, even for high earners. And the biggest difference is that there are usually no perks for using the card, with most cards giving 0% cashback and a select few in some countries giving maybe 1% (and that's typically capped at a certain € amount of cashback per year).

Enter crypto rewards cards and now Europeans have the opportunity to earn some money back while using a card for most of their spending. Typically crypto cashback cards are prepaid (so you need to top up before use). Also, typically cashback rewards are paid in their native token. To the more traditional crypto investor who only owns top 10 coins, this may not be very attractive. However, it is clear that 3% cashback in an asset that has the potential to appreciate beats 0% cashback any day. I highly recommend that those in Europe look into the offerings in this space and hopefully you can start earning a bit of crypto back on all of your daily spending.

Lastly, the point of this post is not to promote any specific company. Hopefully the community can share their experiences with some cards in the comments. I am currently using Plutus and have done a lot of research on 2gether and Crypto dot com, but I am sure there are many more.",CryptoCurrency,Europeans should switch to crypto cashback cards for daily purchases

If you've ever had your wallet dusted before, it can be pretty confusing. ""Someone gave me free money!"" you may think. Like everything in life, there's no such thing as a free lunch. 

**What is a dusting attack?**

[From Gemini...](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin#section-who-would-perform-a-dusting-attack)

&gt; *A dusting attack is an attack in which a trace amount of crypto, called dust, is sent to thousands — sometimes even hundreds of thousands — of wallet addresses. This attack is deployed in order to track these addresses with the hope of “un-masking” or de-anonymizing them.*  

As a cryptocurrency user, you may boot up metamask one day and see an unrecognized token in your wallet. If you have ever posted your ETH / BSC / whatever crypto address anywhere on the internet, this will happen to you eventually. 

Most of the time it's just a shitcoin creator sending their funds to addresses they have scraped from the internet, in order to promote their worthless coin. **However,** it is entirely feasible someone is trying to de-anonymize you. The dust can be tracked through the blockchain until it hits an exchange or lands in a wallet you are trying to keep anonymous. 

Even if you are a small fish, it is inherently risky to swap or move tokens which you did not ask for.

The best course of action when you get dusted is to **never touch those funds, ever.** A good practice is to generate a new wallet address each time you accept crypto. Stacking all your coins into one wallet will increase the chance someone dusts you.

Even if this has never happened to you, being mindful of this attack vector will strengthen your crypto security. Good luck out there!",CryptoCurrency,Unsolicited tokens deposited into your wallet / dusting attacks

**\[Introduction\]:** Hello everyone, this will be my first post in this sub but an explanation and summary of what i think about every day for 1.5 years straight now.

I’ll give my best to explain the background for my investment goal and would love to hear your guys opinions on how I want to achieve it, advice and just good comments. But please read through the whole thing before judging the now named goal. Enjoy everyone :)

**\[Goal\]:** Accumulate a networth of 1 million USD by the age of 30. Right now I’m 25 and have a networth of 5.000 Euro.

**\[Background\]** .

This part will focus on why I want to achieve my goal and I am sure some of you might see themselfes resembled in what I write.

I am proud of where I am. I do not want to sound cocky, I really do not. But I went from a special needs kids school to a normal school . The then-teacher who wanted to send me to the lowest school form due to my weight was wrong, I got to the lowest second school form and long story short - Today I am writing my master thesis in biotechnology while accumulating multiple soft skill workshop courses including a professional trainer educational program recently. To keep it short: I always gave 150% and know where I want to be.

As I always gave 150% I destroyed my mental health, and maybe even that of the ones around me. I went from being adipose to being anorexic, then bolemic to strongly depressed which I still am. Luckily I never had suicidal thoughts but “only” being numb, meaning not being able to identify my own needs. So in the last 2 years I realised I can work as much as I want, give as many % and overworking myself as I want. I’ll either get burned out and replaced in a few minutes by the company I will work at one day or, yet again, lose all my friends and have nothing to rely on except giving 150%.

Based on that I realised that it doesn't matter whether I have a “happy” life with a family, 2 kids and a house, shoot up drugs in my veins every single day or just lay in my bed doing nothing. As soon as we die no one ever knew us except for the memories about the (im)perfect picture they created of us. AS a consequence, i might just as well kill myself right now, or, since I see no reason in doing so, strive to achieve something and not being ok with an average life, average amount of money, average views on what one person can achieve.

So I set myself a goal for my life: The path is the way following the idea of positive nihilism and my path being finding a way to inspire people.

**\[The problem\]:** While attending as many courses for soft skill workshops for character development in my free time I realised every person can be a great teacher you can learn from, but most of us end with a normal life. A house, a kid, a job to rely on. I do not want any of that, I want to go big. Because in our system I am convinced that if you want to make an impact, you need money. Money in order to spend time on character development, having the resources to plan and structure meetings and for being able to reach out to people.

**\[The solution\]:** Start with passive income. But its just a start, mainly influenced first by Kiyosaki like many of us when I kept laying in my bed not being able to stand up or feel anything for months nonstop. Now 1 million in assets in ONLY 5 YEARS is a very hard goal. I do not like the term unrealistic, as I always exceeded peoples expectations in me and reached things people said I am not able to. So I came up with a finance(investment plan I designed myself and will now describe:

* The asset class I need for my goals needs to be highly volatile but offers a good return therefore.
* A safety net of 1500 Euros is set up for each month. I do not have a car right now, after expenses (rent, power costs, insurancy) around 400 euros is left each month.
* I want to invest 200 euros each month of those 400 euros with a 50/50 separation. In cryptocurrencies as it is highly volatile, risky and not backed up by anything, therefore offers higher returns than stocks. The other one being a video game item system for one of the biggest e sport games of today, but we will focus on the cryptocurrency part now as the second one works good so far.

**There are 3 possible investing scenarios I thought about.**

1. The first one focusses on a 20% separation monthly for the next 2-3 years into the nr 2-6 currencies on the cryptocurrency leaderboard each month to accumulate similar to an ETF
2. The second scenario is picking 3 main currencies i believe in from the top ones (ETH, XMR, DOT) and number 9 and 10 of the top 10 of the monthly leaderboard each month as no one can predict cryptocurrrency behaviour at all and losing 2000 euros put into projects which failed over years can be likely countered by putting 50 euros into one other project blowing up instead.
3. The third one is basically 1), but uses a 20/20/15/15/10 separation on the rank 2-6 instead. the remaining 20% will be put into what is called non fungible tokens, an asset class (I have problems to even call them like that) as there are multiple NFT-based projects emerging giving you a monthly payout for simply owning those NFTS. Basically you can imagine it like you buy pokemon cards and get paid by simply owning them (polychain monsters as an example) or by getting paid for playing a game.

Spare money in that time will be put into investments, savings/personal educational courses or nice clothes and stuff I enjoy in a 50/30/20 percent separation.

I’d love to hear your guys' opinions, opinions about other asset classes like gold or ones I do not know about yet which might be a better fit for the goal I want to reach.

I can't wait for your opinions.

**TL:DR;** By the age of 30 I want to accumulate a networth of 1 million USD as based on previous phases of depression and making up what I want to reach in life (inspire people) having a normal life and being ok with an average life is just as good as being what the society labels a failure and being addicted to drug and destroying their own life. Therefore I want to invest into two asset classes with one being cryptocurrencies as they are highly risky and volatile and therefore offer the kind of percentual return on investment I need for the goal I want to achieve.

As soon as I have more free time to spend I want to use this one to start giving workshops and training for those that value my work, and hopefully be able to live on in peoples memories as the person I think of myself to be.",CryptoCurrency,Accumulating a networth of 1 million USD by the age of 30 in a span of 5 years

However, I feel that Chainlink is *at least* as safe of an investment as these two, with just as much potential for growth

For one, Chainlink has incredible real-world applications that aren't going away anytime soon. Yes, they have competition with what they're doing, but they are, at least in my opinion, far and away one of if not the best choice for what it does. This is evidenced by the fact that even during the bear market last year Chainlink was seeing prices as high as $18 (only 28% less than what it is now - and this was around the same time Bitcoin was over 80% less than what it is now).

What makes this even more appealing is that despite seemingly having a floor that's higher than most cryptos even mid-bear market, it has incredible growth potential. Just last month the price topped $50, over double what it is now. This also makes the current price a great entry point.

A couple of people asked me *when* they listed which token and I didn't have the answer at that time. For the sake of transparency and getting everyone the full story, I wanted to follow up.

Another question I got was how did it compare vs ETH so I've included that as well. ETH is one of those coins you can buy if you don't have time to do tonnes of research, but with this list I think you can safely diversify and if ETH ever gets hit hard you won't be in trouble if you're diversified.

If you haven't seen my previous post, it's about the coin/token picks of a smaller Exchange, CoinMetro, they don't list a ton of alts, but what they list appears to be very solid stuff, so you can't really lose with them. Personally I'm not a fan of dog and meme tokens, and these guys only list based on utility, fundamentals and companies they want to work with, I don't think they even ask a fee to list, they just pick what they think is good for their users to trade.

So in my previous post I had some prices wrong, some by quite a big margin, for example LINK at 1, which should have been 0.22. Prices and multipliers are for 17th of NOV, sorry! But it's for the general idea, there's always ups and downs in this market.

Someone from the community made this graphic which includes dates: [https://i.imgur.com/poaVI3F.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/poaVI3F.jpg) \- they didn't sign the image so I will respect their privacy. Here's it in a table:

&amp;#x200B;

Based on Nov 17, vs ETH, only VSP and PRQ are outperformed by just buying ETH at that time. DNA comes very close.

Last time I did not include DNA, QRDO and VSP. DNA because it was a weird one, it was listed way after they initially started, the project has been going for a couple of years already. QRDO and VSP were only listed very recently. But to keep things fair, like people rightfully asked, I included them this time. What I did not include were other midcaps (mainly defi stuff), majors and their own exchange token, see all their markets here on [CoinMetro Markets](https://go.coin-metro.com/markets)

Last time my calculations came down to an average of 38x, I won't recalculate that. My main reason for posting this list is that I think you should keep an eye on what they list and check out those listings. I don't want to come across as too much of a shill for CoinMetro, but that's just something they're very good at. If don't want to sign up to their exchange you don't even have to, following their socials should be enough to keep up to date with new listings. Most coins/tokens are on other exchanges or Uniswap. THT is exclusive to CoinMetro and some other tokens might only be on Uniswap like VSP and DNA.",CryptoCurrency,Why you should follow CoinMetro's listings; outperforming ETH on average (follow up)

This fact is very relevant in the context of the recent market dip and the current recovery we see. 

Let's assume you bought a particular coin at the price of $100. If the market falls by 20 % you will be left with $80. The market starts recovering and your assets starts to grow but this time in order to have your initial investment it will need a 25 % rise to get back to $100. The price might fall with 20 % but it should jump by 25 % not by 20% to break even. 

$100 - 20 %($20) = $80

$80 + 20 %($16) = $96

First, let me start by stating that I am a CRO holder and have been bullish on this coin for a looong time ([https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets\_talk\_about\_cro\_and\_why\_its\_still\_underpriced/](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qia3ri/lets_talk_about_cro_and_why_its_still_underpriced/)). First because it was undervalued and underappreciated and second because the roadmap/Whitepaper that CDC published is extremely coherent, ambitious and sets out what I believe is a clear and plausible path to not only mass adoption, but wide-ranging utilisation of crypto in general – CRO or otherwise.

More importantly, much of what was set out in the Whitepaper has already been achieved, which demonstrates that CDC are firmly on track and that their stated goals are not only plausible but probable.

eg: The VISA, Formula One, UFC, SERIE A, PSG and CONMEBOL partnerships, The NFT Marketplace, Cronos Mainnet, Draco - Phase II of the Crypto.org Chain, The Crypto.org Chain Desktop Wallet (separate from the DeFi Wallet) and of course the Crypto.com Arena.

&amp;#x200B;

**Payment Solutions**

The section covering payment is an interesting one. It seems that the medium to long term goal is to make CRO have as much real-world utility as possible – hence Pay Checkout, the ability to directly purchase AirTime and Giftcards and to be able to send to friends through the app. Whilst CDC may not (yet) hold a banking license, it seems highly likely that Coinbase or CDC will be the first crypto exchange to diversify into traditional finance. That would also explain the recent acquisitions:

*‘CDC agreed to acquire the North American Derivatives Exchange Inc. (Nadex) and IG’s nearly 40% stake in the Small Exchange Inc. for $216 million in cash, according to a statement from IG Group. IG Group shares rose as much as 1.8% in London. The Small Exchange, which is based in Chicago and counts Citadel Securities, Jump Capital, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. and Peak6 Investments among its investors, recently added crypto-related futures to its product list. Nadex is a U.S. derivatives exchange for products including binary options and call spreads, and is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.’*

&amp;#x200B;

**The road to mass adoption of Crypto**

*‘Leveraging the Bitcoin/Ethereum wallet creation growth forecast, and discounting users with multiple wallets as well as overlap between each blockchain wallets, we expect crypto users to grow to 250 to 400 million by 2022’* (Page 27)

If the higher figure of the above is realised, then crypto adoption would have reached 5% by 2022. Given that figure would leave lack of adoption at a staggering 95%, the potential for **all** crypto to gain mass adoption at the 25% mark is clear to see. If 50% global adoption can be reached by the late 2030s or early 2040s, any early crypto payment solution providers are going to be as ubiquitous as VISA, Mastercard, AMEX, Apple, Amazon or Google.

This may sound extremely ambitious, but for those who are curious about what the future holds for crypto as a future global payments’ solution, this paper by The Economist is a fascinating read: [https://digitalcurrency.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digimentality-Crypto-EIU-Final2-1.pdf](https://digitalcurrency.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Digimentality-Crypto-EIU-Final2-1.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

**The Crypto.com Arena**

This monumental deal has been widely publicised, but there is so much potential to utilise crypto in a real world scenario that we should all be bullish on how much it’s going to change. Forget about the branding and think about Crypto.com Arena Ticketing as NTFs or the (hopefully discounted) ability to pay with CRO for tickets, merchandise and food and beverages in the area, etc, etc.

It seems CDC has realised that mass adoption is also going to rely on education as well as utilisation and this snippet from the LA Times would tend to support the above:

*‘Visitors will see one clear change at the entrance to the arena from L.A. Live, adjacent to the statue of Magic Johnson, where 3,300 square feet will become a dedicated Crypto.com “activation space” featuring crypto-centric interactive experiences for sports or music fans. Crypto.com has also signed with the Lakers and Kings as their official crypto partner.’*

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Mass adoption of crypto as an alternative to fiat payments is going to depend on three factors:

· Accessibility (how easy is it to pay with crypto)

· Incentive (why would anyone choose to pay with crypto)

· Integration (the eventual ability to see traditional fiat and stablecoin / crypto balances in the same app)

For those key reasons as well as other factors mentioned above, I believe Crypto.com is positioned to change not only the way that crypto is perceived (first step to mass adoption), but the way that crypto is utilised (actual mass adoption).",CryptoCurrency,I read the entire Crypto.com Whitepaper so you don’t have to … this is why I’m Bullish

&amp;#x200B;

A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

&amp;#x200B;

# Why do you need a wallet?

&amp;#x200B;

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: \*\*""Not your keys, not your coins.""\*\* What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard.

&amp;#x200B;

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. \*\*But what are these keys?\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Your \*\*public key\*\* is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address.

&amp;#x200B;

Your \*\*private key\*\* is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key.

&amp;#x200B;

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

&amp;#x200B;

# About wallet types

# 

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos.

&amp;#x200B;

***Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet***\- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

***Mobile Wallet***\- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

***Desktop Wallet***\- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

***Paper wallet***\- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

&amp;#x200B;

If you choose to go the physical way of storing keys I highly recommend that you buy a piece of soft metal and a cheapest dremel tool to etch the keys into the plate. it takes about 20 minutes to get it done but its 1000x times safer. Paper burns, gets wet, gets eaten by pets and such.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Best Hardware Wallets

# 

***Ledger Nano (S and X)***\- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website.

&amp;#x200B;

Beware that \*\*Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach\*\* in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision.

&amp;#x200B;

***Trezor (One and Model T)***\- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, \*\*the weakest link is always the people using them.\*\* If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

&amp;#x200B;

DO NOT BUY USED HARDWARE WALLETS or from sites such as EBAY, ALIEXPRESS etc.

Be sure to check the wallet for any signs of tampering before using

&amp;#x200B;

# The Best Desktop Wallets

# 

***Exodus***\- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well.

&amp;#x200B;

***Atomic***\- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

&amp;#x200B;

***Metamask***\- arguably the best browser based wallet with the best support. Works best with Chrome and even Brave (as its a Chromium based browser).

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

&amp;#x200B;

# The Best Mobile Wallets

# 

Exodus and Atomic wallet are great also on mobile but if you want you can also check these below

Trust- Trust has been getting very popular and I particularly like it because of a solid browser integrated in app and the ability to seamlessly store tons of different crypto.

***Jaxx Liberty***\-Weird name but a very solid multicoin app.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: many coins have their specific wallets such as Algo, ADA, VET and others. Those wallets sometimes have perks such as staking, delegating and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

As the newest layer 1 to be supported by Gitcoin, Algorand will provide opportunities for developers and non-developers to earn Algo by completing bounty tasks designated by the Algorand team and community. The technical complexity of the development bounties offered will be varied, to suit both seasoned developers, and budding web2 developers looking to cut their teeth on simpler contributions in the web3 space. In parallel, the Foundation marketing team has conceived a host of creative and community-building bounties to allow community members to contribute their talents and earn Algo rewards.

The partnership will also allow the vibrant Gitcoin community to discover the opportunities available within the Algorand ecosystem. Additionally, it allows the Algorand Ambassador program to scale in a way not possible before, to meet the demand of our growing community and their desire to participate and grow the network.

“I’m excited to welcome Gitcoin and its membership into the Algorand ecosystem”, Sean Lee, CEO of the Algorand Foundation. “Our goal is for Algorand to become the development platform of choice for sustainable, decentralized blockchain applications and this trailblazer program will be a key tool in rewarding people who join us on that mission”.

I just wanted to give everyone on here a high five, and generally be a bit sappy. This sub has taught me so much, and as I'm getting older, I'm finding it harder and harder to pick up and learn the latest tech achievements and advancements. 

This sub has not only been good fun, but it's taught me so much. It's put me in the position of being too scared to invest in cryptocurrency, to owning some, to now really getting how it all works. It's allowed me to expand my financial position, and while I bought at pretty much the top of the bear market, I'm confident that long term we have a good thing going. 

More so, though, this has given me a big thing to focus on. I've got closer to some friends who I haven't seen in years because of crypto, it's helped me get through the deep pit of covid lockdowns and isolations, and just in general been a fun place to scroll. 

So, thanks. It's appreciated a lot. You've genuinely helped me. 

I hope everyone has a wonderful day ♥️",CryptoCurrency,Old man appreciation post

If you are interested in making your token, or just how the under belly of crypto works, then this is for you.**

This is a legitimate, crazy story that has changed my mind on crypto and taught me a lot about the trappings of small cryptos on the DEFI scene, specifically Harmony One's network. This is a long story.

**Where this adventure started**

Strange beginnings for a crypto, but I wanted to know how markets worked, how easy it is to manipulate a price, see how much buys and sells effect crypto. Now I am not rich by any means and didn't want to destroy someone else's project, whether it deserves it or not. So I went looking for a cheap way to build a token and deploy it onto a smart network. I first went to Harmony as it is a project I am really excited for (although this experience may not sound like a glowing reference to Harmony at points, I genuinely still believe Harmony will be a top coin in the future). 

Luckily for me, a token generator exists on the Harmony network (it is called tokenjenny, in no way affiliated). I genuinely do not remember how I found it, but it is likely due to the fact it has a tournament with Viper (what I believe will be the number 1 DEX on Harmony, but I have a small bag so I may be biased). I created a simple token based on what I would want out of a small token, a small hard cap on tokens to, no burns, no sale tax, no airdrops. Just a small token which value held itself against itself without using fancy gimmicks. This was also the best way to change prices.

After a few clicks and a wallet connect, I had all 1 million of my token in my wallet. Ridiculously easy and fee less I believe, with the only cost being the cost of sending the coins to my wallet on Harmony. And there you have it, I own a crypto.

**The self market manipulation**

In the beginning I did not have a clue what I was doing, if I am honest. I thought I did, but once you hold it in your hands and you are responsible, trust me it is different. I immediately dropped 8 ONE (about 50c at the time) against 750k of my tokens into liquidity on Viperswap and I had a live token. From there I proceeded to trade the coin in small amounts until the market cap had gone up to around $20 (this is a guess, it could have been less). I sold some more, then bought back and carried on watching how a big buy vs a small buy sent the price to different levels. And how the DEX actively worked against you buying all the liquidity at once with price impacts. This made it clear to me that this actually works. If people trade it, it will go up. This is obvious, but having full control of the market cap of your coin is again a different feeling. It felt strangely powerful and I wanted to know more.

**The dumb luck**

So I knew the only way to know more was to join a pump and dump group. I arrived at a newly started one on Telegram aimed specifically at Harmony projects. At this point the coin was still a self experiment and I introduced myself to the group awkwardly (I am a very awkward person) and started asking questions. The group were nice and quickly I learnt that I needed to burn my tokens so people trusted me. They even taught me how to do this (twist regarding this later). I decided to go for it. They were complaining about a coin that had just rugged and the owner had too much tokens, so I stacked another 200k of my token into liquidity and sent it to a burner address.

**The social experiment**

So, I decided to explain myself to the chat. My coin was an experiment to me and I decided to be honest about that. That and the fact someone could easily buy the whole supply, I said the truth, I am testing your greed as if you buy too much then you will destroy the token. I thought this would lead to someone going FU and just buying it and me being completely out of all my money, which I was ok with, my experiment would then be complete.

**What actually happened**

People bought little bits, the price rose. It started under 0.00001c which was the lowest value possible on the analytics. After a few hours it had reached 0.00001c. No more &gt; sign. Nice. I thought that would be the end. People were saying how much they liked how I put things, how I encourage selling. I woke up the next morning to it being 0.001c. I realised at this point I was in control of peoples money in a way and therefore I had to be responsible with that. I would hate to be why people lost money down to my experiment.

**Putting the work in**

I opened up a telegram and added people. The prices at certain points gets hazy at this time because it was all so surreal and a major whirlwind. They asked the obvious question, what now? What now indeed. I did not want a pump and dump, I couldn't do that to people. Don't get me wrong at some point I will sell some, but for now I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose people money. I set a price target of 1 token = $1, if not 1 token = 1 One thinking it would be unreachable. The price hit 0.01c. I promised to make a website. I looked into ways to add value. With a coin that does nothing the only value it has is the value that people put to it, so I went looking for ways to add value. It became pretty clear to me that the best use case for the token was to use it in liquidity pools. But how do you get one of those when your coin is still under $1k? I joined the token jenny tournament. A tournament where the 1st placed prize would get you an incentivised pool and a nice cash reward. The price hit 1c. I made a website and set up a tournament to create the logo, paying in my token. The website was to be revealed after the tournament. The price hit 6c. My token had a market cap of $60k in the space of a week from creation. 8 One had turned into a value of 1 million One in the space of a week. It rose to 8c.

**The dump**

I woke up the next morning and the price was 4c. Ouch. My worst fears had happened. It had battled against it but that was it, the end. Or so I thought. People asked what happened and to get people interested I went shilling. Not to pump and dump, but to get new customers. Not all the dump was people selling all, they were just taking profits, good. I had said from the beginning, you sell when you need to, no one knows your story and what that amount of money will do to you. People liked my response. It battled to 10c but dropped again.

**The copycat**

Someone released a coin called 1 billion. It was a reference to my name and advertised it as homage. It was a memecoin standard, where there were burns, tax and no proof of liquidity burn. I found it a compliment. People were annoyed that I didn't get annoyed, but I genuinely thought it would be good for my coin.

**100k Market cap**

This weekend was meant to be my wedding anniversary and nephews 1st birthday. I spent all weekend keeping people active. Growing bonds with people and advertising the competition. The competition happened and the response was immense. Immediately I added the winning logo to the website and shared the site. I expected to wake up back at 1c with the hype dying and having to talk down people wanting free crypto. I had made the mistake of paying people who did not win too as I liked their submission. Big mistake. 

I woke up with the price at 9c. As soon as I was active again it was at 14c.

**Jealousy/FUD**

So I had started noticing that certain people were saying not so nice things about my token and me. The main one being the rug pull. Easy to get rid of with proof of liquidity sent to dead address. This did not stop it. Then it was that I will print more. I showed the contract, hard cap 1 million tokens. They created a telegram group to do group research into new tokens. Fine by me, it is needed. 1st post, my token is on their watch list. I lost my rag. I didn't understand what their problem was. I should have stayed out of it, but it was other people's money in my hands. It felt personal. I managed to bat back every FUD except the fact there could be whales, I couldn't argue that, there were 2 or 3. It was inevitable. 

Then I went onto viperswap tradeable coins on Coingecko and realised my coin was the only Harmony coin with a green trust score. They soon gave up. They were the creators behind 1 Billion or in the circle. 1 Billion got rug pulled. I came out shining. The price stayed stable.

**The tournament**

We flew into second place and have stayed there since. The leading coin is probably out of reach, and they know the tournament creator and viper devs. It feels like they were meant to win. I hope I am wrong.

**The hype dies down**

So this is now getting to present day. Big buyers become smaller sellers, but still selling. We sit at a still very respectable 6 to 7c. I have plans, and will soon start approaching other DEX's for liquidity pools as I now fully understand our value in a pool. Being none deflationary nor inflationary, our value would hold a coin up very nicely. I have to learn social media marketing too, but I will get this coin on a DEX and in a pool. I have to.

**What I learnt and how it changed my view on crypto**

I genuinely thought that it would get bought immediately and I would be dumped off. I was genuinely ok with that. But I learnt that people just want a chance at a better life and crypto gives them hope. Some make it. Some don't. 1 Billion pumped and rugged so hard I had people apologising to me that they had to sell mine to cover losses there. I always said I understood and I did to a certain degree, at least enough to know it wasn't an act against my token.

The DEX market is really a shit show beneath the hood. Dodgy analytics that lose connection making people think you have rugged (I have been told this is down to Harmony One issues at the moment, which I am inclined to believe). People trying to scam as many people as possible. Harmony was a nice place, but as more comes along the more it becomes like any other. Copies of copies popping up everywhere. It is good, but I wish I could get the message out to everyone, do not dip into it with money you can't afford to lose, even money you don't want to lose. You will lose 9 out of 10 times. There are geniuses in the early days, but they are heavily outnumbered by scammers. It is a shame, but it is inevitable with full decentralisation.

Token value is set by greed rather than worth. A coin with green candles will outsell a coin with red candle any day of the week. People forget the saying sell when there is greed and buy when there is fear so quickly due to FOMO. It is terrifying and something I am going to start drilling into my kids ASAP.

Analytics are easily scuffed, especially at low level crypto. I learnt this myself but also watching other coins in the tournament. Do not fall for green candles, please.

Honesty can win, I was honest from the beginning, I will stay honest. Our little success is testament to this. It pushes me and the community to put more work in and make a genuine project. I know we will get there.

Being responsible for peoples money is scary. Never will I ever trust anyone again who outright fully enjoys this. I thought it would be fun making money for people, but genuinely it has been terrifying, dizzying and has caused so much anxiety. This is why I have to make this work going forward.

I went to sleep last night and when I woke up this morning, to my horror the price was tanked.

now, I know this was my fault and I've taken a valuable lesson from this. NEVER get too greedy in anything, especially if you are a trader or farmer. many have lost far, far more than me and I feel for them. but the common factor with all of us who lost is greed. if something seems too good to be true it probably is.

*Hey all. I originally wrote this intended as an article for those new to crypto and Nano, but figured you might enjoy it here as well. Comments welcome*

First off, to understand the excitement about Nano, all you need to do is **try it out for yourself, within 2 minutes.**

1. Install [Natrium](https://natrium.io/).
2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://freenanofaucet.com/).
3. Fill in your Nano\_ address and hit send.

To fully appreciate Nano’s speed and ease of use, it’s recommended to get a second wallet on the side, like [www.nault.cc](http://www.nault.cc/) in your browser, or [Nalli](https://nalli.app/) as a second app on your phone. Nano tends to transfer faster than you can switch screens. Try sending some from one wallet to the other and see for yourself. Sending to yourself like this doesn’t seem impressive, but the transfer you just did is possible from and to **anyone, anywhere, anytime**, with no one able to stop your transfer and not a cent paid in fees. It’s secure, borderless and uncensorable money, open to anyone.

**A short history of cryptocurrency**

Cryptocurrency started with [Bitcoin](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf-bitcoin/). Created by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/three-people-who-were-supposedly-bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto/), Bitcoin solved the challenge of how to have digital money that could not be copied. It offered a form of money that no one party could print more of, or block transfers of. In doing so it offered a way to transact, internationally, without relying on (central) banks, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

This was an attractive proposition following 2008. At the time, many banks were being bailed out, while central banks printed a lot of extra currency to support these bailouts. [This money printing hasn’t stopped since](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-idUSKBN2B22TY), leading many people to conclude that as extra dollars and euros are being printed, the dollars and euros they hold are becoming worth less and less over time.

[Bitcoin transaction cost and speed](https://preview.redd.it/lmt8phlcss571.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e97d3e4b33118a194b057d159c9b38749cc2ed75)

However, Bitcoin comes with its own share of issues. Transfers take, on average, [over 2 hours,](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/avg-confirmation-time) while being incredibly expensive, and [Bitcoin uses more energy than some countries](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet). It doesn’t scale, with capacity maxing out at roughly 7 transactions per second, and due to the fees and waiting times is practically unusable as currency. While a beautiful idea, as a means of payment it has failed.

**Enter Nano**

Nano’s primary developer, Colin LeMahieu, was enthusiastic about the possibilities that a self-sovereign form of money like Bitcoin offered. However, he was frustrated with the inefficiencies in (then) current cryptocurrencies. In 2014, he began development on a new cryptocurrency. The goal was to create a cryptocurrency that could be used for daily payments by everyone, without the [carbon footprint that comes with Bitcoin](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet).

&gt;[Nano makes money efficient for a more equal world — simple to pay with, easy to accept and open to all.](https://nano.org/)

To accomplish this, Colin came up with a new architecture for Nano. Rather than having one big blockchain, [where everyone competes for space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDEQE8lmaqs) in the next “block” to be mined, Nano utilises something called the [Block Lattice](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/nano-block-lattice-explained/). Instead of competing for space, users add blocks to their own chain and broadcast this addition to the network.

[Nano's block lattice graphic](https://preview.redd.it/8w1h6l4ass571.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5117f85e3cdc8ee4b680525fdfdde07f0e267bc1)

Nano combines the block lattice architecture with [Open Representative Voting](https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/#representatives-and-voting) (ORV). Every Nano holder votes for a Representative using their Nano balance. Anyone can be a Representative, and anyone can change their vote at any time. These Representatives confirm transactions (67% consensus needed) as soon as they see a transaction, which means that Nano’s speed is mostly limited by internet connection latency (practically the speed of light). This is what allows the Nano network to confirm transactions within a second.

In mining, energy is expended to be the first to mine a block. In Nano, there is no such competition. Because there are no mining rewards and no fees, the network is cooperative. In mining chains, hardware resources are used for competition. In Nano, every available resource is used to confirm transactions as securely and quickly as possible. If Representatives upgrade their hardware, the throughput of the Nano network increases. This focus on pure efficiency and lack of waste makes Nano a green option that uses very little energy.

[Nano's energy usage](https://preview.redd.it/93nctoe9ss571.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff58d1985b54af130e82ded7707209ebeac742ca)

Summarising, Nano uses a block lattice where each person has their own chain, rather than one big chain. Anyone can add blocks to their own chain, at any time, and Representatives (validators) confirm these transactions as soon as they see them. Because of this, Nano manages to be instant, feeless, scalable, and incredibly energy efficient.

**The goal of Nano**

Nano is intended to be [digital money for the modern world](https://nano.org/). It was freely given away to anyone willing to solve captchas. Because of this, [Nano was distributed](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) broadly and fairly, mostly to people in poorer countries. Because of its feeless nature, it’s well suited for lower-income countries. Because of being instant, it works as a medium of exchange, as money. Because there are no fees and there is no inflation, no money is lost when either [storing value in Nano](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8), or when using Nano.

[The vision of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-vision-of-nano-an-instant-feeless) is broad. It allows for cheap remittances. Foreign workers pay [an average of 6.8%](https://migrationdataportal.org/themes/remittances) in fees to transfer money home. Nano can do this far more efficiently, both at lower cost and faster. It allows merchants to [start accepting payments](https://www.bitrequest.io/) anywhere in the world, instantly, without fees. It enables [streamers to receive feeless tips](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lrqhmu/i_made_a_twitch_bot_for_nano/), enables anyone [creating art or self-publishing](https://npass.dev/npass) to instantly take small (or large) payments for their works. It enables anyone suffering from hyperinflation to [securely store their money](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8) in a currency whose supply can’t be increased. It allows charities to [take donations](https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins/nano-payments/) from all over the world. This means [less money going to middlemen](https://coindrop.to/), and more money arriving directly where it’s needed. Nano makes money efficient, frictionless, secure and borderless.

**So why hasn’t this taken off yet?**

I’m speculating here, but I think that many people have heard of Bitcoin. If you’ve spoken to someone about cryptocurrency, there’s a good chance they mentioned Bitcoin. Most people see Bitcoin just as an investment. A fraction of those who invest in it actually try to use Bitcoin, and most that do conclude that Bitcoin is slow and clunky. To many people, Bitcoin = cryptocurrency, and therefore all cryptocurrency must be slow and clunky. Nano’s claims seem outlandish after having experienced Bitcoin, and it’s easy to dismiss Nano as too good to be true. Hence my instruction, at the start of this post, on how to try Nano out for free, within 2 minutes. Since you probably skipped over it the first time, I’d like to end this article by saying that you spent so long reading this, you might as well try it out, for free!

1. Install [Natrium](https://natrium.io/).
2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://freenanofaucet.com/).
3. Fill in your Nano\_ address and hit send.

That’s all! To really try it out I’d recommend getting a second wallet such as [Nault (web-based)](https://nault.cc/) or [Nalli](https://nalli.app/), then sending some Nano from your first wallet to the second.

Most people that try Nano come into the [Nano subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/) asking why Nano isn’t bigger yet. This is exactly why. Most don’t know about Nano yet, most haven’t tried it out yet. Nano has no marketing budget, no ads, no venture capital funding. Its marketing consists of Nano enthusiasts spreading the word, relying on word-of-mouth and organic growth. It relies on businesses starting to accept Nano payments because it saves on costs for them, on people using it because it’s the most efficient option. This tends to start off slower, but given the [explosive growth in Reddit subscribers](https://subredditstats.com/r/nanocurrency), the rapid addition of [businesses accepting Nano](https://wenano.medium.com/announcing-wenano-business-for-ios-and-android-80bf77b078b8), and the constant increase in projects built on Nano it seems faster growth is starting. All it takes to convince someone of Nano’s potential is to have them try it. That seems like a strong potential for growth to me.

***You can see the full blog post with all the tables*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5)***.***

January 1st, 2021, I bought the following and turned it into a homemade index fund: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, Litecoin, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Binance Coin,** and **Chainlink.** Below is the fifth monthly update on the progress of the 2021 Experiment.  But first...

**USE CASE FOR MOONS!:** There's a hidden musical link below, what is? ***79 Moons to the first person to name the song and the artist AND say when you got into crypto.  Why 79?

***tl;dr:***

* **What's this all about?** Back in January 2018, I made a homemade crypto Index Fund, purchasing $100 of each of the Top 10. Crypto winter started immediately after, but I haven't sold or traded and have been reporting monthly ever since. I repeated the Experiment 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments (including why in the world I would include Tether)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***

## Month Five – UP 281%

https://preview.redd.it/9q4vxcpw2u571.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=415521becc7359adceb66b7411df1893d1647c81

Like the rest of the [portfolios](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/), the Top Ten Class of 2021 took quite a hit in May.  With the exception of **Cardano**, every crypto finished in the red, essentially giving back the gains made in [April](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4).   

## May Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

Seven out of the ten cryptos made a move this month, most to the downside: 

Ups:

* **Cardano** – up three places (#7–&gt;#4)
* **Tether** – up two places (#5–&gt;#3)

Downs:

* **Binance Coin** – down two places (#3–&gt;#5)
* **Polkadot** – down one place (#8–&gt;#9)
* **Litecoin** – down three places (#11–&gt;#14)
* **XRP** – down three places (#4–&gt;#7)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down three places and out of the Top Ten (#10–&gt;#13)

https://preview.redd.it/tggg2pby2u571.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a33144d9deb64bf2fa9b6233679e43473df4edd5

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2021:**  Five months into the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, three cryptos have already dropped out: **Chainlink, Litecoin,** and most recently **Bitcoin Cash.**  They have been replaced by **UNI**, **DOGE,** and **USDC**.

## May Winners and Losers

***May Winners*** – There was just one winner this month: **Cardano**, up a strong +33% while the other cryptos bled.  

***May Losers*** –  Binance Coin had a rough month, shedding -40% of its value in May. **BTC** and **XRP** were the second worst performing cryptos, both down about -36%.

**Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers**

After five months, here’s where we stand in terms of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers: 

https://preview.redd.it/fufb0jwz2u571.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6d29c5751e9a04f5ddf465942feb1df5935804b

## Overall Update – ADA flips BNB for the lead, all cryptos in green, Bitcoin worst performing.

**ADA’s** strong month coincided with **BNB’s** no good, very bad month resulting in a flip:  for the first time since [February](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-2), **Cardano** is back in the lead. 

The $100 bucks I invested into **ADA** five months ago is now worth **$977**.  

Besides **Tether**, **Bitcoin** is the worst performing cryptocurrency of the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio – although it still has an ROI of **+24%** after five months, double that of the S&amp;P over the same time period (see below for details).

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

https://preview.redd.it/gj42m9813u571.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb7886a2db88b7769a18b198b9ae8533b6b524ac

After passing the **$2 trillion dollar** mark [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-4), the crypto finished May around the $1.6T mark. The total market cap is up +112% since the beginning of the year, not keeping up with the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio’s +281%.  If history is any indication, this won’t be the case for too much longer:  the rest of the [Top Ten Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/) are well behind the market cap in their respective time periods.

## Bitcoin Dominance:

https://preview.redd.it/bl68qa923u571.png?width=547&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24bec0b5d4c65e192b4731321509aabc6a416185

**BitDom** continued to decline in May, now at a new 2021 Top Ten Portfolio low of 42%.  

To see what happened last time **Bitcoin** dominance was at similar levels, you’d have to go back to the early months of the [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Spoiler alert: this was when the crypto market was imploding, kicking off the years long bear market we’ve only recently emerged from.   

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2021:

https://preview.redd.it/gptk8e733u571.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50370c31a400e5b50099c97b92ef35d4318671c2

The 2021 Portfolio lost $1,118 in May.  Overall, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio is up +281%, the initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2021 worth **$3,809**. 

Here’s the month by month ROI of the 2021 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

https://preview.redd.it/gicg5as43u571.png?width=361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b256aab1a41a5f422e83c7a7016e9660f8a4a8b

A very strong first few months for the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio – and the best start, by far, of any of the four [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).

## Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

As most readers are aware, this is the fourth year of an Experiment I started back in January of 2018, [at the height of the last bull run](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/).  Where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41): up +26% (total value $1,264)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29): up +459% (total value $5,594)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +630% (total value $7,300)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5): up +281% (total value $3,809)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$17,967** ($1,264 + $5,594 + $7,300 + $3,809).

**That’s up +349%** on the combined portfolio.  It’s a big drop from last month, but looking at the big picture, the combined portfolios are back to where they were two months ago in [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3). 

Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

https://preview.redd.it/686odtv73u571.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f732ba48d543c0ab25bb59d9ce2b5acb26889b9a

***That’s a +349% gain by investing $1k into the cryptos that happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.***

## Top Ten Index vs. Top Three Index

Inspired by a suggestion from one of our blog readers, let’s take a look at how the 2021 Top Ten approach would compare to just focusing on the Top Three.

I crunched the numbers, and to make it more interesting, I removed **Tether** from the index and pulled #4 into the Top Three.

A Top Three Index (minus **Tether**, plus **XRP**) would mean $333 into **BTC, ETH,** and **XRP**.

https://preview.redd.it/kotl14mh3u571.jpg?width=797&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb05be9e44d24fc279ed8781b2a1fcd94f339d45

Down quite a bit from last month, but a hypothetical Top Three Index would be worth **$3,061**, returning **+206%**.  That’s compared to the **$3,809** (+281%) of the 2021 Top Ten. 

At this point in the 2021 Experiment, it would have been better to go with a Top Ten Index approach instead of focusing on the Top Three.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. The S&amp;P had modest gains in May, but it was enough to notch yet another all time high:

https://preview.redd.it/4ep4owwi3u571.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=089fe2b633dcdc2fb98bc12b2f40a0cd0b7f4875

The S&amp;P 500 Index is up **12%** in 2021.  The initial $1k investment I put into crypto five months ago would be worth **$1,120** had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500.

The 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is up **+281%** over the same time period. Five months in, the initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth **$3,809**.

That’s a difference of $2,689 on a $1k investment in just five months.

What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1570 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1680 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1300 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1120 today

Taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,670** ($1,570 + $1,680 + $1,300 + $1,120).

That is up **+42%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+349%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 307% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

https://preview.redd.it/y6o1kpxl3u571.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11b8e670c3137b7906b98bd8899ce6e1efd5a0d1

## Conclusion:

Saved by **Cardano** from a dreaded all-red month, the 2021 Top Ten Portfolio continues to perform well.  Despite a chaotic May, this group of ten cryptos is up **+281%** since the beginning of the year.  As we approach the summer months, we should start to see if the bull run has any life left in it or if we should start preparing for another extended downturn.

The short is this.

* Gary Gensler took a beating. The witnesses and some members of the committee over emphasized the need for less interpretation but instead more guidance being needed to be provided by the SEC.
* To no ones surprise Replublicans argued that regulation would move this tech away from America. Democrats argued defending and protecting consumers. (please spare us all your personal feeling toward party) we just don't care.
* The lady who called the hearing is concerned how fast the industry is growing and is bothered by celebrities endorsing crypto. I agree with her on the 2nd part. We don't need these clowns on tik tok or you tube telling people to invest on etheruem max for their one shot to the moon. BTW whatever happened to that shit coin?
* The big topic was stable coins and we knew this. There was also talk of a CBDC but stablecoins were the hot potato talk. That seems to rub some of these old people wrong.
* Personally I thought many of the MoC were prepared and had done their research. Some even seemed excited to be discussing and learning about block chain, Stable coins, bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, FTX and more. They even talked NFT's. I wished they had gotten deeper into DEFI. I have a feeling that is coming.
* I thought the FTX dude killed it. He was smart, sharp, educated and didn't miss a beat.
* I hope next time they invite Vitalek!

Anyway. The hearing left me optimistic. I think the future is bright and we will own it. Keep buying those effing dips and HODL to Jupiter. We are on our way!

1639004968,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rc3jxe/crypto_crash_over_60_of_investors_who_borrowed/,1972,686,"In a [study by KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/finance-news/cryptocurrency-consumer-research-and-data-autumn-2021/), it was revealed that over two thirds of cryptocurrency investors borrowed money to make their purchase, rather than using income and/or savings.   


Overall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so.   


Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and a risky way to invest large sums of money. Bitcoin, for example, reached at all time high of more than $69,000 (£52,000 approx.) in early November. Just a month later, it is now worth just over $50,000 (£37,700 approx.) per coin.   


That’s a drop of almost $20,000 in just a few weeks.   


Percentage of crypto investors who used one or more credit facilities to fund purchase, by age  


* 18 - 24: 70%
* 25 - 34: 64%
* 35 - 44: 68.9%
* 45 - 54: 62.5%
* 55 - 64: 45%
* 65+: 25%  


As the data shows, those aged between 18 and 24 were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds to make their investment, with a significant drop of borrowers in the two highest age groups.  


What type of credit facilities have people used to fund cryptocurrency investments?  


When we break down what kinds of credit facilities people have used to purchase cryptocurrencies, over a third (35.5%) made their investment using a credit card. Almost a fifth (19.3%) funded the purchase out of their overdraft.  


* Credit card: 35.5%
* Overdraft: 19.3%
* Personal loan: 14.6%
* Secured loan: 9%
* Payday loan: 7.6%
* Re-mortgage: 3.3%  


Holly Andrews, Managing Director at [KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/), comments on the findings.   


“In recent years, cryptocurrencies have become far more mainstream with tech giant PayPal now offering a cryptocurrency trading platform.  


Although cryptos, and specifically Bitcoin, have seen people make thousands or even millions in profit; the last few weeks have shown that they are incredibly volatile and can see investors losing large percentages, or all, of what they put in very quickly.  


It’s concerning to see that so many people have turned to borrowed funds to purchase cryptocurrencies as they are extremely unpredictable and offer no guarantees that the money invested will be returned. So, if people are investing money that isn’t theirs and subsequently losing it, this could cause some serious financial challenges later down the line.  


The biggest concern is those who don’t have the means to pay the money back, especially if their original plan was to repay their loans with the profits made from their investment. With a very strong possibility of losing the money for good, people may be left severely out of pocket and racking up interest on their credit cards and overdrafts. Also, some credit card providers will view this type of transaction as a cash advance, meaning a cash advance fee and higher interest rate will be applied.  


So, if you are thinking of making an investment into cryptocurrencies, you should only invest an amount of money that you can afford to lose and it should be funded through income and/or savings rather than a credit facility.  


Borrowing money to invest in cryptos can become a very vicious cycle that’s difficult to break. Once you start losing money, it can be very tempting to invest more to make the money back; especially if you don’t have other means of repaying the funds.  


Great care should be taken when you invest money anywhere, but especially when it’s something as volatile as cryptocurrencies. If you can, seek some professional financial advice first and never invest more than you can afford. Buying cryptocurrencies should also not be your only form of investment or savings as there is very little stability – spread your investments out and treat cryptocurrencies as a smaller, fun investment.”",CryptoCurrency,Crypto crash: Over 60% of investors who borrowed money to buy Bitcoin are now sh**ing themselves
1639004813,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rc3i25/the_tech_dot_brings_to_our_ecosystem_is_the_same/,437,143,"I frequently see confusion regarding the technical details of Polkadot (DOT). Here is a really quick explanation. If you have questions - please ask and I'll try to explain.

Okay, so, imagine the history of crypto as it relates to tech advancements in this space.

First, there was BTC. This represents mono-chain value transfers.

Then, there was ETH. This advanced our ecosystem to mono-chain computation where the most basic computation is value transfer, but then loans etc.

Then ETH became bloated and fees went up. Competitors appeared - also computation mono-chains, but lower fees and better technicals. First-mover network effects result in BTC and ETH maintaining their value.

Now, our ecosystem is at the point where we have cross-chain value-transfer bridges a la ""wrapped tokens.""

Next? Cross-chain computation-transfers. This goes beyond just moving value between chains - its having one chain tell another chain to compute something that it's more specialized at computing than the first chain and having both chains trust the results.

*This* is Polkadot. It provides not *just* cross-chain value transfer but allows for cross-chain *computation.*  This is why it is important. It unlocks the next step in crypto which is analogous to the introduction of ETH into a pre-ETH ecosystem. It introduces computation to an area that currently only has value transfer.

EDIT: The real n°1 coin: MOONS 🌕",CryptoCurrency,For all newcomers: Here are the TOP 50 Coins and a Description
1629458251,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p83615/stake_bat_to_earn_btc_brave_partnered_with_axion/,675,218,"In case you are wondering what's going on in the Brave browser with Axion all over it:

The **B**asic **A**ttention **T**oken finally got a new use case. BAT can now be staked on Axion (AXN) to earn passive income in Bitcoin dividends. The shortest staking period generates a minimum of 8% APY. The longer the staking period, the greater the bonus on the initial stake (up to 20% bonus for a max stake of 15 years) which earns up to 36% APY!

The Bitcoin dividends can be withdrawn any time and AXN dividends are earned along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Axion is a DeFi project on the Ethereum nework. It allows you to generate passive income with AXN, which will be burnt in exchange for shares from the dividend pool. The staking period could be anything from 1 day to 5555 days. A longer stake gives more bonus shares.

The average stake length is 2547 days with more than 80% of the supply being staked!

&amp;#x200B;

With the new integration not only AXN can be staked but BAT can be used to stake too! BAT will be used to give the equivalent amound of AXN shares in the dividend pool.

&amp;#x200B;

A new loophole for shitposting on CC; earn moons, BAT and BTC. And 1% of the ETH bid is used to plant trees resulting in 2.56M planted trees today

I'm really curious what this will look like. Will there be a steep learning curve for businesses and average citizens? Will they adapt quickly?

I'm hopeful that this is successful and spurs other countries to adopt it.

what you should do now is to open the trade section of your exchange, select XRP/USDT(cuz its the best stablecoin out there) and click Sell button. after you sell it with current price(which was 1.25 when i made this), you should click on Buy button and rebuy XRP or any specific coin that you just sold in loss and VOILA! by doing so i now own 402 XRPs( cuz i had 2 usdts left in spot from previous remaining dust) and i am in almost in 0.5% profit.

1623712675,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nzzuhk/shortterm_technical_analysis_on_bitcoin/,166,132,"**ABSTRACT**

Bitcoin will consolidate and sit relatively even at its newfound support lines (37.5k USD - 40.5k USD) from a few days to 1.5 weeks at most, before blasting off to reclaim the bull-market support band at around 43k USD - 48k USD.

**FUNDAMENTAL REASONS**

Bitcoin is post-Wyckoff distribution, and that is certain from its historical trend (Fig. 1) and textbook reference (Fig. 2). To a great degree of certainty, most distribution patterns of the sort often proceed with an accumulation phase, of which Bitcoin so far as demonstrated (Fig. 3) when compared to a textbook model chart (Fig. 4). If current markers are demonstrated to such a precise degree, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with Bitcoin continuing and completing the trend, which would be to consolidate (meaning stagnant) preceding a major pump.

&amp;#x200B;

As for why these fundamentals exist in Bitcoin's current market, you must think back to why Wyckoff patterns exist. These hallmark patterns exist due to the presence of market manipulation, where massive institutions and organizations attempt to maximize profits to the detriment of most HODLers and traders because in their capitalistic nature, they aren't here to play charity. Everyone keeps hoping for institutionalized interest, and well, ya got it now.

&amp;#x200B;

Now think of Elon Musk's tweets, the FUD from WSJ and the alarming block chain analysis of major Bitcoin movements and correlate them to specific timelines of the Wyckoff model. Of course, it makes sense now! These patterns exist because this distribution phase is designed by the path of least resistance to shake off as many traders and bag holders in the profit of institutions.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto why an accumulation phase often happens right after a distribution phase. The institutions are simply not done with Bitcoin yet. In a post-distributive phase, these organizations now attempt to keep prices in a channel and repress any major volatility in order to slowly stack up and fill more bags of Bitcoin unbeknownst to the public. This phase is almost always done preceding a major move to the upside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TECHNICAL REASONS**

As of June 14th, 2021, Bitcoin has extremely undersold RSI and stochastic trends, indicative of a imminent market correction that lasts at max a week (Fig. 5). However, our newfound resistance/support level of 38.5k USD and an important psychological barrier of 40k should, with a little bit of luck, keep Bitcoin's price stable enough at 39-40k in order to ramp up buying strength again (Fig. 5).

&amp;#x200B;

Fig. 5 is also a graph showing specific Fibonacci market resistance lines and time scale lines, showing the immense pocket of support (and resistance) we are currently in. This is further evidence to keep prices stable in the short-term for RSI valuations to get up to speed and top off the accumulation trend with a relief rally.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason for a bullish relief rally is due to a specific stock trading pattern (Fig. 6). As shown by the graph, there has been considerable resistance causing consistent lower high's in Bitcoin's recent charts. To have this bit of resistance broken certainly spells good fortune.

&amp;#x200B;

Just for some quality assurance that I'm not some kind of shill jumping on random trends, I saw this pump coming a long, long way. Fig. 7 was a graph I had drawn on the 3rd of June for a proof of concept idea in order to prove that I saw this coming the long way. Was just busy back testing certain algorithms and barely had time to really work on it until now.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the meat and potatoes. Historical emulations from the 2013 double peak cycle hints on a heavy resurgence or relief rally too before a double peak (Fig. 8), extrapolated from well, *the 2013 cycle.* As for what fundamental reasons matched the current cycle and what had happened 8 years ago, institutionalized investment and a price advantage variable had caused Bitcoin to hit a logarithmic regression peak, causing an imminent correction. More of this will be explained in further posts.

As well, the presence of Wyckoff theorems in both cycles provides the final glue to the notable similarities of these two timelines. The only difference is the accumulation time, where 2013's lasted a few days while our current cycle is sitting at around a couple of weeks. This is the only unexplainable reason, which can be due to an unlucky stochastic RSI shift that made Bitcoin lose a lot of momentum in the current cycle. Again, more of this will be explained in future posts.

There are a lot of vulnerable newbies joining the crypto space with the recent events and they must hear this.

There is a trend of orchestrated pumping and dumping events mostly from Discord channels. These are designed by the lead organizers first making the followers part of the pump (after the organizers have bought some good amount in advance) and then with their network effect on Twitter etc. they try to capture newbies and immediately dump it on them (and most of the followers that cause the spike too). Sometimes it takes seconds right after the start of the pump with the organizers not waiting for others to join (probably depending on how the price is dropping at that point) and just drop it on just the followers who spiked the price 10 seconds ago. It's a huge scam trend (occurring much more frequent than before) and we must really spread this around!",CryptoCurrency,"WARNING!

They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.




EDIT 1: It was a mistake on my part to say crypto is not used for money laundering. I saw that Bill Gates mentioned cryptocurrency as an innovation that the world can do without because it is sometimes used for criminal activities and with the current pandora papers leak where the ultra rich was dodging taxes using tax havens and trusts and thought , here is a guy doing borderline unethical things to dodge taxes and is bad mouthing a nascent technology because it is used for criminal activities by a small section of people taking advantage of its use cases. He was saying the world doesn't need crypto without seeing it's far reaching positive sides. 


I thought if a few criminal activities makes him think that crypto should be stopped, why doesn't he say the same thing about the banks, law firms and other institutions that promote, support and enrich from tax dodging. That's why I made the post.
I am sorry I made the mistake in the headline, it was unintentional. 

I didn't expect the post will blow up or will be seen by more than a couple of people. Sorry again.",CryptoCurrency,Bill Gates said “The way cryptocurrency works today allows for certain criminal activities. It’d be good to get rid of that”.

Keep in mind, these users are not banned just for having a very similar writing style. The examples cited above are just a ***tiny sample***. Writing style is not the only thing moderators look for, but it's the most visual thing to share to everyone on here.

While this user may have been permanently banned from this subreddit, we still need an emergency proposal to remove this user from distribution or **20158 karma or 5422 moons** will still be distributed to this user on October 6th.

This subreddit have very strict rules on using multiple accounts to bypass the karma cap, or otherwise game the system in an effort to earn more moons. Rule 3 is ""No Manipulation"" and that counts for bypassing Governance rules for the subreddit.

By passing this poll, it will remove the above accounts from the current distribution, ensuring they do not receive the final moons allocated for their posts and comments in snapshot 18. The methodology to address problem users has been laid out by Reddit admins.

Just figured I would make this post to remind you about Bitcoin Dominance. 

I know most people own a lot of Alt coins. No reason to panic, in fact , we want BTC dominance to go up if the bull run is to have a second coming. This is very healthy, and the last few days have been very encouraging to see alts losing steam and Bitcoin gaining steam. 

The reason for this - Bitcoin sets the market, we want Bitcoin to move in a very healthy way. When it does, it sucks a lot of the interest on Alt Coins. Alt season always comes after huge Bitcoin moves so, a few things:

\- This is not the time to be trading Alt coins. 

\- Either stake them (if you plan to hold long term) or use them in the ecosystem (if you plan to). 

\- You will want to increase to exposure to BTC. 

\- Be patient with your Alts, don't panic sell, but it's not unwise to re-allocate some to BTC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember - I know a lot of the community gives a ton of sh\*t to Bitcoin. But bitcoin MOVES the market and Bitcoin dominance up, when bitcoin trends is extremely Bullish. 

So let's help papa Bitcoin put on a show for the next few weeks/months, so we can really get the next leg up starting. 

Everything works in cycles, remember. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great day, Inshallah.",CryptoCurrency,BTC dominance is going up. Adjust your strategy!

Like it says on the title: last year I just happened to have $50 to spare and, instead of adding it to my other crypto investments, I decided to have a little fun and invest on coins with a low market value that no one seemed to know about (at the time anyways). I swore to myself that I would not check on their progress until a full year had passed.

Why October 3rd? Because I knew I'd remember it due to all the Mean Girls and FMA memes, that's why.

Anyway, without further ado, here are the ten coins and how much money they've made me since:

**#1: Polkastarter (POLS)** is a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) built on Polkadot for token pools and auctions. Its value rose **208.3%** in the past year, earning me **$10.41** extra.

**#2: Flamingo (FLM)** aims to unleash the full potential of DeFi, a crucial component on which to base the Neo Smart Economy. Its value rose **21.4%** in the past year, earning me **$1.07** extra.


**#3: Tellor (TRB)** is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts on Ethereum to securely connect to external data sources. Its value rose **162.4%** in the past year, earning me **$8.12** extra.

**#4: Qtum (QTUM)** is a cryptocurrency which uses a proof-of-stake consensus model for creating new blocks, which is far easier and less energy-intensive than Bitcoin's proof-of-work model. Its value rose **509.8%** in the past year, earning me **$25.49** extra.

**#5: Polymath (POLY)** is an Ethereum token that aims to facilitate digital securities trading on the Polymath platform. Its value rose **2031.2%** in the past year, earning me **$101.56** extra.


**#6: Stellar (XLM)** is a decentralized protocol on open-source code to transfer digital currency to fiat money domestically and across borders. Its value rose **343.4%** in the past year, earning me **$17.16** extra.

**#7: Monero (XMR)** uses a public distributed ledger with privacy-enhancing technologies that obfuscate transactions to achieve anonymity and fungibility. Its value rose **149.8%** in the past year, earning me **$7.49** extra.


**#8: Serum (SRM)** is a decentralized exchange software built on Solana where cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold by traders. Its value rose **470.8%** in the past year, earning me **$23.54** extra.

**#9: Avalanche (AVAX)** is a platform for creating custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). Its value rose **1599.8%** in the past year, earning me **$79.99** extra.

And finally, the last coin, which gave me astronomical returns, and which makes me incredibly sad I didn't put more money into it. But oh well. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say.

**#10: Gala (GALA)** is a platform that builds a range of blockchain-powered games, each of which provides players with true ownership of their in-game items through the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its value rose a wooping **12153.9%** in the past year, earning me **$607.695** goddamn extra.

So... yeah, that was wild. Notice how there was nothing but profit. If you invest in crypto and leave it alone for a year, it will almost surely be nothing but profits. I love crypto because of that.

The bond has not yet been launched on the market.


The announcement was made by the CSO of Blockstream, a company involved in El Salvador’s project related to the issuance of this bond. 
The bond is called EBB1 (El Salvador Bitcoin Bond 1), and of the $1 billion budgeted, $300 million has already been booked. 
In reality, these are only “verbal commitments”, but it seems that there are additional benefits for subscribers in order to encourage even more purchases. 

According to Blockstream itself,  the bond has been months in the making and has the potential to accelerate hyperbitcoinization through a new financial system based on Bitcoin.
Bitfinex Securities will issue the Bond on Bitcoin
The bond will be issued in the form of tokens on Liquid Network, and the $1 billion raised will be used half to buy BTC, and the other half to fund the cost of building Bitcoin energy and mining infrastructure in the region.

Bitfinex will issue the Bitcoin Bond

The issuer is expected to be Bitfinex Securities, to which El Salvador will grant a licence to be able to process the bond issue. 
The Bitcoin Bond will distribute special dividends generated by the staggered liquidation of BTC bought with half of the funds raised by the issuance on the market. Blockstream’s Asset Management Platform (AMP) will be used for the distribution, whereby the dividends will be paid instantly to the bondholders.

This project, according to its creators, represents the beginning of a real reform of the capital markets, built on Bitcoin and Level 2 technologies such as Liquid Network.
In fact, thanks to these new technologies, capital can flow easily from all over the world without friction, dividends can be distributed instantaneously and respecting the privacy of investors, and bonds can be traded 24/7, even with stablecoin and without intermediaries.

Just wanted to share some good news coming out of the Algorand Foundation today. Anyone who is actively involved in the community might be aware that a recent issue cropped with in relation to governance and rewards. Essentially, holders had to commit whatever Algo balance they wanted for the second period of governance BEFORE they'd received their rewards for the first period. This meant that the rewards earned from committing to governance for the first period could not be compounded in the second period. This would pose a similar issue for round 3 etc. The community had noted this and raised same with the Algorand Foundation who, today, have announced a change in the periods to sign up for governance, allowing us to commit to governance after rewards are distributed and compounding our hard earned Algos in every governance period if we wish. 

For more details/confirmation I'm not making it up:  [https://algorand.foundation/news/key-dates-algorand-governance](https://algorand.foundation/news/key-dates-algorand-governance) 

Or, for those who are link hesitant:  

&gt;As a result of community feedback, and in the spirit of the festive season, we have adjusted the timing of the governance commitment periods to enable Governors to commit Algo inclusive of their Governance Rewards, distributed  at the end of the current Governance Period ( G1 ), to the next Governance Period ( G2 ). This will be standard practice for all future periods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Additionally, the Governance Rewards for G1 will be automatically delivered into eligible wallets from 1st January 2022. As noted, to be eligible for G1 rewards you must have voted and maintained your commit balance right to the end of governance period.     
&gt;  
&gt;**Key dates for your diaries:**         
&gt;  
&gt;Commitment Period for G2: **December 25th 2021 to January 7th 2022 (11:59:59 PM SGT).**  
&gt;  
&gt;End of Governance Period for G1: **Midnight 11:59:59 PM SGT 31st December**  *( you must keep your account balance above your governance commit until this date to ensure eligibility to claim rewards ).*

His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.

For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.

The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.

This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents.

It may take years like it did for Jamie Dimon, but eventually, they will come around and embrace cryptocurrency and digital currencies.

**TLDR:** Institutions went from calling cryptocurrency a fraud to being one of the biggest cryptocurrency investors. Cryptocurrency haters will eventually come around, even though it may take years for some! Don't give up brothers and sisters and cousins!

#**Summary:**#
**A pump and dump scheme** is where a group of people pitch a coin (or stock) to other people to spike short term volume, and therefore the price, in order to profit from selling their own supply at the higher price to the newer investors.


&amp;nbsp;

**How to spot a PnD:**

- Promises of huge gains

- Forced short time frames to make a decision

- No discussion of risk - or questioning permitted

- The opportunity finds you, you don't find the opportunity

- Comparison to recent success stories - e.g. GME (dubious whether this will even be a success long term for individuals)


&amp;nbsp;
**Tips to avoid** - see below but the main two for me are: 

- Recognise emotional decision making, in yourself, and when it comes from others (people you may normally trust). You need to recognise this behaviour, and cut it out at source. To step back and breathe.

- Ask yourself, what are they selling me on, and why? If they find you, you are being sold. That is all there is to it.

#**What is a Pump and Dump scheme?**#

&amp;nbsp;
A Pump and Dump scheme (PnD from here on in), is where an investor, or group of investors promote a coin they already hold (or are purchasing) in order to cause positive sentiment and the price to rise. At this point these investors will then sell their coins to the newer investors, causing the price to crash and leave the people who fell for the PnD with a large potential loss, or coins which are now worth a lot less than the price they paid for them.


These are not new and were traditionally done via phone call. If you have watched the Wolf of Wall Street, or similar films about penny stocks, you have seen this stuff in action. If you are buying, you are the retail investor who gets taken for a ride.


With the recent influx of new users to this site, and following the PnD schemes surrounding Doge and XRP, lets take a look at how to spot a PnD scheme

&amp;nbsp;

___



#**How to spot a PnD scheme?**#

&amp;nbsp;

- **Promises of huge gains, in a short amount of time.** If it sounds too good to be true, it is. In crypto (and stocks) if someone is talking to you about something, they are selling you their position. If it is positive - they likely own it, if it negative - they either want prices to fall or they hold a competitor. Ask yourself, why someone would be going out their way to tell you something is a once in a lifetime opportunity? If it was, they would be keeping it secret and accumulating themselves. These people are salesman, and you are the one buying the bullshit





- Linked to the above there is often a **time element - 'get in quick, or you will miss it'**, they are relying on your impulsive decision making to jump in - they are manipulating you to over ride the logical part of your brain which makes decisions based on information and context




- There is **no discussion of any potential risks or downsides**, and you are removed from groups or harassed for asking basic questions - this is a hive mind at work, and you are being censored from raising any concern or legitimate question.



- There may be reference to 'how this time is different', or it **plays on recent successes** which are in no way comparable - e.g Game Stop - anyone who paused for a second would realise why not only was financially the short squeeze on GME completely different, but also the moral stand point was too. XRP, for example, is a centralised system which enriches the founders beyond belief. Yet these groups tried to ride the sentiment of GME to convince others to join - as a show of rebellion and alliance.



- **Social media storms are cooked up**, it seems like out of nowhere this is all anyone can talk about - when has this ever proven a successful decision? Once everyone is talking about it, you are already too late. You may not lose money, if you are lucky, but you are still the one being duped. Again this is feeding on emotion and Fear of Missing Out. There will be groups created and ran by mods who run them like cults - no talk of anything but price going up is accepted.



- **There is a time or plan attached** - e.g. Pump and Hold at 8:30. For the love of god, if this is the case, sell before then. All the leaders of these groups will have done. All of these public announcements are done again to create legitimacy and make you feel at ease - as a collective.



- Generally any concept of **'we are in this together'**, coming from a group trying to actively push up the price of something short term = PnD. You are not in this together, markets are competitive - they are survival of the fittest whether you like it or not. They want your money, when you listen to them - you are basically offering to hand it over. People invest to make money, especially when the entire premise is pushing a price up to get rich. They do not want what is good for you, they are using you and they will take your money if you allow them to. They are telling you, because you are the opportunity - not the coin.



- **Be aware, people telling you to hold and buy more, are using you.** They want you to push the price back up so they can sell. If you are in these groups - on social media, be aware you may be talking to bots, or at the least people who are trying to dump on you. When it drops, get out.


&amp;nbsp;


___

&amp;nbsp;

#**How to avoid PnDs in future**#

&amp;nbsp;

- **'Why are they telling me this?'** - this is the first and main question to ask yourself. What does the person sharing the information have to gain from telling me? In this case - you invest and push the price up, allowing them to make greater profit. Understand why they would be sharing details with you - if it such a great thing, why are they sharing it?


- **if it is a friend telling you, ask for more information** - why it is doing well, what the plan is etc - if they can't explain it properly, this is a big red flag and they likely have fallen for it too.


- **Look out for how someone talks to you about it** - is it emotionally driven, does it make you excited? scared to miss out? - This is exactly when you need to step back, breathe and ask yourself if you are thinking correctly. Emotional decision making is not a good thing here, and then ask if they are intentionally trying to get an emotional reaction out of you? (see the above - FOMO, get rich quick etc)


- **Is there any room for nuance?** Are you able to discuss the potential cons or risk? If you are laughed at, or harassed, others are told to ignore you (he won't be getting rich, weak hands, pathetic seller) - this is a huge sign that you are investing in something where no other thoughts are allowed. The reason for this, once you are out the bubble - logic returns and you see the smoke and mirrors for what they are. PnD groups work like a cult, only one form of thinking is allowed, everything else is censored.


- **Did this come out of nowhere, do I even know anything about this?** If you don't know anything about it, except it makes money, don't invest in it. This is a terrible decision for two reasons. Firstly, and most obviously, you have asymmetric information - you have no idea why and what you are buying, therefore can't make an informed decision - only an emotional one. Equally, this kind of thing pushes panicked, emotional selling. When you don't know fundamental reasons why you invest in something, when the price dips you will sell. Why? because when your brain asks you the question 'shit it is dropping, what do we do?!' - your logical brain won't have an answer, because you never gave it the information to form one. This second part is more relevant to regular investments, not PnDs of course, but is worth bearing in mind before you invest in anything.


- **Was the coin relatively stagnant, or has it dipped recently?** PnDs typically target coins which haven't moved much recently, or have lower trading volume, this allows for a much easier spiking of the price due to a small change in demand equalling a big change in price. If you look at the charts and it was doing nothing until this big flurry of activity - you are being taken for a ride.


- **Look for the news**, if it is pumping, don't listen to people inside the group - search for reasons why something is pumping. If you can't find anything of value, there probably isn't anything, and you are gambling on emotional decisions.


- **The opportunity finds you, you don't find the opportunity.** Getting rich off 'undervalued' coins, or finding a hidden gem is not easy. They are hidden for a reason. If someone is coming to you with this, remember they are selling. You are buying.


- **If someone does approach you, talk to someone else outside of the bubble** - find another group e.g. r/CC, or other investors - talk to them, get outside perspective before investing. 


- **look for examples of populist sentiment**. Do you hear things about an other? - e.g. haters, those missing out who are jealous. Are you made to feel like you are part of a special group? The ones with insider information? This is a lie, it is very very common manipulation within populist movements, cults etc - to create a narrative of an other to entrench tribalism within the group. This is done to make you switch your brain off, to rule on emotion.


- **is there a recent comparable story that was successful?** e.g. GME (yes this isn't the same at all in reality, but the story being sold is - or at least plays on the hype of GME). If there is, you are being played. The real opportunity, just like the hidden gem, is the first one. When people tell you this is happening again, they are simply using the positive news from one case and applying it to their own - often because it lacks any actual, real, tangible reason for succeeding or being a good investment.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


#**I fell for a PnD, what next?**#

&amp;nbsp;


**Have you sold yet - No? Are you in profit?** Sell. Whilst you still can. Greed will tell you not to, and perhaps you can eek out a little more money. But you are gambling, and gambling extremely high risk against people trying to take all your money.  

&amp;nbsp;


**Yes, you have sold. Did you make a profit? Yes** - great. You are still a an idiot, just a lucky one. Tell yourself that. There is a difference between opportunist traders taking advantage of PnDs and someone getting lucky and getting out before it collapses. Do not confuse the two. The first group know what they are doing (and they may still lose, but they are aware of the real risk). You are fucking lucky. Don't do it again. So count your blessings, go through the same process of learning about PnDs and begin to understand why you fell for it, how to avoid it in future and realise you are up - you won. Don't go back in, you are asking to lose.  

&amp;nbsp;



**Yes you have sold? Did you make profit? No?** Ok, this is normal - 90% + of people doing this will end up in the same situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Recognise and accept your mistake**. Do not feel ashamed of it, it is ok. You were played, it happens to all of us in our lives at some point. 

- **Step away** from whatever device you used to invest. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WIN IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. You will most likely make things worse, investing again on emotions - even worse emotions now, shame, anger, disbelief.

- **Talk** to the important people in your life if you feel comfortable, if not, come here or to other anonymous groups for support. It is important to share what happened, to vent emotionally whatever it is you feel.


- **Realise it is only money**, even if gambled way more than you should have done, long term you will get out of this. Focus on other areas of your life for the time being - emotional investment, fulfilment and development - seek out things which may centre to your emotions again, whatever that may be - getting out in nature, cooking, reading, adrenaline sports - whatever the shit you need, do it. 

- **Consider who, if anyone needs to know.** Did you borrow from you and your wife's joint account? Accept a loan from a mate? These people need to know the truth. Do not hide it and hope to win it back. Tell the truth. They deserve it. 

- **Do not repeat the same actions**, if you want to win long term from this - you need a different approach. Step away from the high stakes casino and figure out long term strategies to make money. 


- **Learn to diversify and manage risk**. You are taking a huge gamble going all in on something - even if it isn't a scam, you need to protect yourself through diversifying your investments. Get rich quick schemes are the fastest way to lose money.


- **Educate yourself on these behaviours** - I would recommend *'Thinking Fast and Slow'* by Daniel Kahnemann as a personal favourite. This book helps to look at and address the biases that make up our emotional decision making, and learn how to recognise these and instead 'think slow'.

In case you happened to miss it, the short version--that I gather is not an uncommon scam--was that rumors of this telegram investor group that planned on pumping and very specifically not selling XRP to keep its value rising. People were told the pump was going to happen on Monday, at 8:30am. 

I bought into the hype -- having missed out on GME and Dogecoin I was in a really ""I want to get into investing"" mood and was *certain* that this was gonna be it. Everywhere I looked about this was filled with memes about going to the moon with it and really positive talk, and everywhere that was *not* filled with memes had almost no discussion on it. Which honestly makes me realize is part of the issue; the only places I heard about this in where also places where you were made to feel crazy for not buying into the hype. It was a really bad feedback loop.

Fortunately I stumbled upon a few discussions on this subreddit about it and it helped me take a step back and think about the logistics of it. I thought about it a lot and looking outside of my bubble really helped me realize how I wasn't investing, I was positively gambling. I had no idea about XRP as a technology and was buying it solely as a quick get rich scheme which was a terrible idea. The many stories people had here about how pump-and-dump schemes worked to prey on overly excited newbies helped me realize that I *was* the overly excited newbie and I wasn't a weird exception, I was just being driven by FOMO and hype. 

I had bought in when it was at .4, and last night when I was up late reading this subreddit and realizing I had screwed up it was going up by a lot, at .67. I set up a stop limit at  .65 and went to bed, woke up realizing how close I had come to losing a lot of money.

Now to be clear, I did do some reading and I think that XRP could be an interesting coin to invest in. But not the way I did it and not for the reasons I did it. I want to say I dodged a bullet, but instead it’s more accurate to say you guys pushed me out of the way when the bullet was on its way to me. I really appreciate that. In the future, I’m going to invest in crypto when I legitimately believe there is a long term possibility of growth based on the technology and opportunities instead of trying to ride the wave. I learned an invaluable lesson and can’t thank you guys enough for it.",CryptoCurrency,I would like to thank this subreddit for helping me narrowly avoid the XRP pump-and-dump.

Reading about Ethereum (the network) on their site - it seems... big. Like game changing big (if it's adopted) - I know right now most eyes are on Ether but what really interests me is the network around it.

I know all the ""alt-coins(?)"" that surround it like Compound and Uniswap, at their core, rely on the Ethereum network - that's all good. But the apps that also run on the network are interesting - seems like there is big potential there. It seems like a ""new internet' from reading it since it has something to do with being decentralized and running on nodes (I guess?), but at the same time I start to wonder if it's ACTUALLY different or if it's just marketing jargon. They describe it as a P2P thing (similar to torrents? I guess? is that accurate?) I just wonder how the network would scale if it suddenly sees a ton of adoption.

The website (and Ethereum shills) make it seem like this is the next big thing - their interest in moving to the staking model sounds like (if it works) that it could be great (though the potential downfalls could be a massive hit on Ethereum as a whole) - a huge reduction in energy usage is a +1 from me, seeing as how I work in the energy industry.

Also people always compare Bitcoin to it - I know Bitcoin is the ""mother"" of Crypto as we know it - but in general I feel like I either see mostly negative things about Bitcoin (aside from it's monetary value), or no talk about it's future plans are. Seems like more of a volatile ""stock"" than a currency with a big plan. Why are most eyes still on it? People always complain about the energy usage of Bitcoin and it's energy impact on the global grid. I know that there are a bunch of ETH network coins that make changes based on people who earn tokens from staking into it the coins? How does Bitcoin make changes (if at all), or was it basically deployed the the mysterious Satoshi and left to fend for itself.

Sorry for all the questions here - this stuff seems really interesting and I am most definitely excited to be a part of it all but it still feels really ""uncharted"". I think Reddit Moons may help to get more people interested in the network though.

Me and a few friends tried to warn them but with all the Wallstreetbets and GME hype, it allowed a ton of crypto newcomers who didn't know what a ""pump and dump"" scheme is to get scammed.

This comes right after the large doge dump.

The worst part is, their moderators made no efforts to remove posts related to the scam. It is reported that /u/nvok (a moderator of /r/Ripple and /r/XRP) and fellow moderators were allowing the scam to be promoted and were removing posts that were negative towards it. They also ban any users that critique Ripple or XRP (the token of Ripple). It is unknown if they were involved in the scam, but it is evident they failed to educate their users.

Feel free to **report both of those subreddits** by contacting reddit admins.

These explanations are not super in-depth but I know that many aren't taking the time to actually read the documentation from these projects and hopefully some of this will help give our community a better understanding.

#  Smart Contract Blockchain Platform

## Ethereum (ETH):
Ethereum was the first of it's kind, at least, the first to successfully make a large blockchain platform that successfully deploys and runs smart contracts while also handling millions of transactions a day. (Running a smart contract is also considered a transaction.  As of today, Ethereum has managed to put out 1.303 million transactions and there are over 3000 decentralized applications (dApps, https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum)


With those transactions in mind, Ethereum has an issue on its hands and you can guess it. Gas. Gas is the method for which the entire blockchain runs. Imagine your car, you need gas to crank it and drive it. Same thing you need gas to send transactions. Why is this? This is due to to the Proof of Work protocol that allows for these transactions to be done. I won't go into the nitty gritty. But basically, you're paying the miners to process your transaction.

## Cardano (ADA):
Cardano is developing a smart contract platform on their blockchain technology. Supposedly it will be more feature-rich than Ethereum. However, the biggest difference between Cardano and Ethereum is that Cardano utilizes a newer concept known as Proof of Stake. Proof of stake basically has members who hold a specific token the ability to stake their tokens into a stake pool so that the representing server of that pool may process transactions and earn rewards. Those rewards are then dispersed to the members staking their funds. (Expecting personal attacks for mentioning this name, but this is how the Tron (TRX) network runs).

Literally not much else to be said at this point, until Cardano releases Smart Contracts and their documentation and mission proves friendly enough for developers. We can't speculate whether it's a better platform than Ethereum. 

With ETH 2.0 expecting to come out next year, there will not be much difference between these two except for how their governance works and how their Proof-of-Stake works. With this in mind, what matters is the community between these two and which platform provides better documentation for the community and big organizations to be able to developer their own decentralized applications on.



# Internet of Blockchains

## Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot's main goal is to utilize a relay chain to coordinate the system and the Parachains. Parachains are the platforms which will be built by other development teams to create their own blockchains ON the DOT platform. For example, if Ethereum were in the development stages of OG Ethereum, then they may have considered developing Ethereum on DOT  so that some features were already handled (such as security and communications between other blockchains.) 

You can not run a Smart Contract on DOT's network. The relay chain was deliberately minimized in functionality so that it could focus on the main components of DOT. However, there are Ethereum competitors known as Ink!, Moonbeam, and Edgeware that will be coming out on the DOT platform as Smart Contract Parachains (blockchains.)

Validators are basically servers producing blocks on the Relay chain and they receive staking rewards for producing them.

Collators are nodes on both a Parachain and a relay chain, they collect transactions and produce state transition proofs for the validators to accept. Also are the method of communication between blockchains through XCMP (cross-chain message passing)


##  Cosmos (ATOM)

Cosmos main focus is Internet of Blockchains but is a tad different in how they want to interact with these blockchains compared to DOT. Seems more like ATOM wants to compete with Smart Contracts by allowing Application-Specific Blockchains. It looks like they are trying to attempt this by allowing developers to develop a blockchain that is customized to operate a single dApp. I don't fully understand how they plan to do this. I'll come back and edit this section in the morning.


The main goal of Cosmos however is still to allow developers to create blockchains on top of Tendermint (cosmos default consensus engine) so that they can interoperate with one another. The main difference between DOT and ATOM is that DOT will be more specific about how you can create your blockchain in order for it to operate on the DOT network. ATOM has more freedom for the developer.


I'm always welcome to criticism. 


Edit:


Some people misinterpreted my poorly worded mention of TRX to mean that the network of ADA through PoS would cause more network attacks. I really meant that I expected the sub to blast me for mentioning Trons name

Edit 2:
Guys this is an overview of the projects and who they are contending with. This is not supposed to be an in-depth post explaining how each one of them differentiate themselves from their competition.

Basic economic theory is that the price of a specific good or service is based on the relationship between supply and demand. The equilibrium price is where the amount of people who want to buy equals the amount that is being sold. Easy. 

This is how bitcoin works. There is no set value. No central authority to buy it from. Instead, traders offer to buy it from each other. If there are more buyers than sellers the price goes up. If there are more sellers it will go down. 

There is an indicator for assets and securities that are being traded called RSI - relative strength index. It measures the momentum of a stock - or in this case a cryptocurrency. It basically looks at the last ""closing"" price of bitcoin and compares it to the previous day over 14 days and produced a score 0-100.

A score below 30 means that something is oversold - the supply of bitcoin is so high for example that there are far far more sellers than buyers. This indicates that the price is being driven down by oversupply - not a loss of value - so you should buy. 

A score above 70 means something is over bought. There arent enough bitcoin being sold to meet current demand and this is driving the price up - not an increase in underlying value - and so you should sell. 

These are fine technical indicators but as a note you will make more money if you buy and hold than using rsi. So don't make it your whole strategy! Sometimes demand is high and supply is low because something is amazing and so you should hold, not sell. 

But in anycase this happened with bitcoin. Multiple reasons caused demand for bitcoins to skyrocket. Tesla, pandemic, aths, etc. Bitcoin is already heavy on hodling, so there's already  not a huge amount available to buy. So the price started to get too high. If you bought bitcoin at 58k you were paying a premium of about 15% of the actual value just because supply was too low. 

So this is where corrections come in. Eventually people notice a stock is overbought and they can get an extra 15% over what their asset is worth. So they sell. And more people do that. And more and then...momentum shifts. 

Demand drops and supply explodes - the price drops over 10%. That's a correction, and it's good. Because markets almost always overcorrect because the price is driven by psychology. It's not precisely clear what the true value of bitcoin is. What does everyone think it's actually worth, if it was at equilibrium? 

So bitcoin isn't diving off a cliff, it's correcting. There's a minimum resistence level. This is the price that bitcoin has already ""beaten"" and is now considered it's minimum. 

A lot of analysts are saying it's around $42,000. That was a previous all time high that it dropped off from and then rallied past. The markets have already decided 42k isn't overpriced. 

So that's what happened. The markets were hot. Demand was too high. The price got high, there was a sell off and then Helen yellen was sayin that bitcoin is dumb and that started the sell off!

This shouldn't be taken as financial advice. Just a very rough layman's explanation of why bitcoin has corrected. 

You will see lots of people say buy the dip. Understand this is not risk free. You can make a lot of money if the upward trend continues after the correction. But it can just as easily go down for the next year. 

I am personally going to start DCAing into BTC probably now. It's 48k as of writing. At 47.5 I'm gonna open  like 25% of my position. I think it'll continue down but I really like bitcoin so I want to start now, incase everyone else loves it as much as me and it goes up again. 

You do you, but IMO (and many analysts) it won't go any lower than 42 and I will be v hungry at 45. I think these biden bucks are gonna drive inflation and I think bitcoins returns will be nice enough for consumers and institutions to get in. 

Tldr : don't panic price corrections are good and natural and give an opportunity to buy close to bitcoins ""true"" price. But also maybe it will drop like a lead balloon. Idk that's the disclaimer right? This might be wrong.",CryptoCurrency,Why Markets Correct Themselves - Basic Theory

He talks about crypto and blockchain tech quite a bit in there, and uses BTC long term holders as a good example of why it's important to understand what you are invested in. He basically said that those that bought crypto and understood its fundamentals, where able to weather the storm of the crash and continue to hold for a 2 year brutal bear market, and out now reaping the rewards of that conviction.

I think this is an important point. Having faith in your investment is key for a long term hold. To have faith in something requires you to spend the time to learn its fundamentals.

I've been holding since 2017 and during the bear market the only coin I would buy up from time to time was ETH because out of all crypto, ETH just makes the most sense to me as far as having a tremendous value due to its utility. So when there was fear all around and blood on the streets, I felt confident in buying up more ETH sub 150.

A lot of new people might not know this. Case and point, [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/lr9fwe/this_is_all_i_have_im_scared_to_lose_everything_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) on bitcoin sub

This guy went all in with all the money he had, he thought he was just buying btc with his money, he didn't realize it was a margin account with 3x leverage, he didn't even know what margin is. His position got closed out once and he opened another position, still not knowing that he was playing with borrowed money. 

To put in short and simple terms, what margin is:

Margin is literally borrowed money. 
Let's say you put 1000$ in and it's a margin account with 3x leverage. That means your broker lends you 2000$ and your buying power is 3000$. 

You buy btc with 3k, btc dips 33.3%, so your 3k has gone down to 2k, the exchange/broker pulls out the 2k by closing your position and you're left with nothing. 

If you had bought 1k worth of btc without margin, for you to go to nothing, btc has to go down to nothing aka, go down 100%. 

The higher the leverage (2x, 3x, 10x), the smaller the % dip required to wipe you out. 

So if you see, words like **buying power, margin, leverage or 2x, 3x, etc** where you're buying, you've accidentally opened up a margin account, and its not a simple buy, you're opening up a long position with borrowed money.

But I've also been burned a few times myself, and I've been in the shoes of the concerned individuals and even the veterans inhaling a hefty dose of denial and copium. 

Anyways the reality of what's going on right now is if you've bought crypto within pretty much the last 3 weeks for the first time, this is your first major dip. It's likely you pretty much bought the top (for now). Which means you're already in the red. And that can be scary, especially since no one actually knows what's going to happen. Could rebound, could crash 80%. Crypto is an extremely volatile and unpredictable market (which is why some of us love it). And you have to be mentally prepared for just as bad bad days as good days. It's not always 30% gains every other day. 

There's a few really important things newcomers need to know instead of everyone trying to play large dips/corrections as ""not a big deal"". What you should consider as a newbie is:



-Try not to be over leveraged, absolutely only put in what you're willing to see go all way to $0. Really think to yourself, ""if this hit literally zero could I live with that?""


-There's a good chance you may need to hold longer than you expected. Chances are you aren't going to become rich overnight. The long game is a better strategy for most. Trading will likely get you burned, sometimes you'll make a play that seemed genius at the time only find out it wasn't. 


- Dips can be terrifying, but they often come and go. Try not to panic sell, as many have said here, technically you only lose money if you sell, your amount of coins/tokens doesn't decrease. If you hold long enough, it'll likely recover. Might be months or years unfortunately, but hang tough. 


- Buying the dip is pretty smart if you bought in high, that way you can average down the costs of your purchase. For example, if you bought Litecoin at $210 and it dips to $160, it might be smart to buy and average your costs somewhere in between. A dip isn't always a time to buy for everyone though. If you bought Litecoin at $75, a dip to $160 isn't exactly a ""dip"". More like a chance to potentially increase your holdings if you're willing to. 


Anyways. Dont let the veterans fool you, we've all shit ourselves at least a few times in this market. Just HODL and be patient, you'll get there in time.",CryptoCurrency,Some tips for newbies and why veterans need to try to respect the concerns of newcomers.

One such project is Venus Protocol, which CZ just thumped his chest hardly 6 hours ago as ""#3 now"", and claims to have $2bn worth assets locked in the protocol. Venus is a copypasta fork of Maker DAO and similar to DAI, Venus issues VAI which is a stablecoin pegged to the value of USD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except its no longer stable, its value has crashed over the last few days and the $1 peg has now turned into a 9-10% loss for anyone holding VAI over other stablecoins such as DAI or USDC/USDT/BUST. And the value is fast crashing. $2bn worth assets in the protocol could be due for a liquidation if this mess isnt fixed immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, there is no price stability mechanism in Venus, the same mechanism used in Maker DAO which gives DAI its peg was not included in Venus' copy paste job. Incredible. For some crazy reason, Venus VAI stablecoin has no mechanism to adjust the interest rates and keep the value stable. Did the Venus devs really think the value would be stable all by itself?

I have only been on Reddit for a few months but I learned so much from it that I figured I should try and give back to the community. English is my second language and this is the first time I ever write a full-length article, I hope you will enjoy reading it and I would be very thankful if you could provide some feedback about my writing, about the topic, or about anything else really… So here goes!*  


**Why you should learn poker and game theory:**

My story is similar to that of many: I learned about the game 10 years ago (during the golden age of online poker) when some friends of mine invited me to play a home game. Although I initially thought of poker as just another game of chance akin to playing slots or roulette in a casino, I quickly came to realize that there is a lot more to it as my more experienced friends would repeatedly get the best of me during these home games, which led me to start watching videos and reading strategy books to improve my skill… Little did I know it’d be the start of a journey that would impact many different aspects of my life way beyond the game itself, as most of the fundamental principles learned through poker can be applied to your decision-making outside of the game, especially when it comes to money management and investing. Now, let’s dive into a few of these principles:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Risk management (i.e. Bankroll management)**

When learning about how to be successful playing poker, the first big piece of advice most people come across is bankroll management or BRM. To understand BRM, you must first realize that poker has a lot of variance: you might be vastly ahead in a given hand but there is almost always a slim chance that you will lose in the end if one specific card hits. This implies that you will sometimes lose even though you were a 99% favorite, and that you will sometimes get unlucky and lose 2, 5 or maybe even 20 such encounters in a row. THIS is variance. It doesn’t mean that you played bad or that you made bad decisions, but rather that you got unlucky. Over time you will have lucky streaks and unlucky streaks, and these will average out in the long term… It’s just the way the game goes.

Now that we understand variance, let’s get back to BRM. What is it exactly? Let’s say you are the best poker player in the world but you only have 1000$ that you can EVER use to play with. Taking your whole 1000$ on one table and multiplying your stack at an exponential rate might seem like a good idea. Surely nothing can go wrong since you’re the best player in the world right? But variance can be a bitch ;) Even if you’re the best you will lose regularly and you will sometimes get unlucky, it’s just part of the game. The correct move here is to apply BRM, which means only using a small % of your available capital for each game you play in order to reduce the risk of going broke. Using only 100$ per game would already be a lot safer, but you still run the risk of going under on a streak of bad luck. If you only allocate 10$ per game you play, then it becomes virtually impossible for you to ever go broke, even on a huge streak of bad luck. Sure it’s not as exciting and you won’t be making money quite as fast as you could, but this is the way to go to make sure you don’t go broke…

This approach to risk management translates very well to investing:

\- **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Once the money is on the table it’s as good as gone, which is why you should only use your “spare” cash and never invest with your living expenses or worse, borrow money to invest. 

\- **Diversify your investments.** There is always a chance, however slim it might be, that you will lose most of your investment. This is why going all-in on a specific investment is generally a bad idea (this applies particularly well in the crypto space).

Proper BRM allows you to make sure that you will come out ahead in the long run if you play well, which basically comes down to making more good decisions than bad ones. But that’s assuming you don’t let emotions come in the way of your decision-making, which brings us to our next point…

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Emotional management (i.e. Handling tilt/Positive mindset)**

Nobody likes losing… In the same way we enjoy winning because of the dopamine rush, we feel bad when we lose which is totally natural. Overcoming this and avoiding tilt (irrational decisions made out of anger/frustration) is an essential skill for any successful poker player. You might play a sound game of poker and apply good BRM, but you will still lose if you let your emotions get the best of you. 

After a loss, rather than being angry and frustrated, you should evaluate your decision-making. If your decision-making was good, you just got unlucky and you shouldn’t worry about it since you are playing for the long run (remember that variance teaches us that anything can happen in the short-term). If your decision-making was bad, you need to learn from your mistakes and move on. The key here is to always have a positive mindset: making mistakes is part of the learning process and should be seen as an occasion to improve. Being angry and ranting, on the other hand, rarely result in anything positive.

Again, this translates very well to investing:

\- **Don’t be impulsive, don’t let your emotions cloud your judgment.** You should not FOMO because the price is pumping, nor should you sell because of FUD or price corrections. If you believe in a project, short-term price changes (did I hear someone say “variance”?) shouldn’t bother you.

\- **Don’t get stuck up on losses.** You bought the top and it crashed immediately after? You sold the bottom right before a huge rally? Don’t let this bother you: what’s done is done and you just need to move on and make the best of your current situation.

\- **Have a positive mindset.** Anger and frustration lead to nothing. Yes you could have bought in 2009 when you first heard about it, hindsight is always 20/20. Stay positive and keep learning/improving yourself.

The good thing about all this is that it goes way beyond poker or investing. Being aware of your emotions and how they affect you, learning how to handle losing even when you were “supposed” to win, etc… All this can tremendously help you in all aspects of life by making you less impulsive and more rational in your decision-making. Now, this leaves us with our last fundamental principle of a sound poker strategy:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Basic stats and probabilities (i.e. Expected value/Odds)**

To become an accomplished player, you will inevitably have to learn about these simple mathematical tools that poker players use all the time in their decision-making process, such as odds and expected value. To make it very simple, the expected value (EV) of any bet is ***(REWARD \* WinRate - RISK)***, meaning that if you can bet 1000$ with a chance to win 10k$ half of the time, your EV is ***(10000\*0.5)-1000 = +4000$***. Obviously these are great odds to take as long as you have enough capital to overcome variance. But things would be very different if the odds of winning were only 5% as your EV would then be negative ***(10000\*0.05)-1000 = -500$.*** Now this is clearly a bet you should not take…

Now that you know probabilities, statistics and game theory are useful decision-making tools in poker, guess what? They are also extremely useful in investing! Even better, the study of game theory with problems such as the “Byzantine generals” or the “Three prisoners” has been, along with cryptography, the foundation on which blockchain technology was built, enabling the trustless and decentralized services that are about to revolutionize our world… 

Assuming this was enough to pique your interest and make you want to dig deeper, I’ll just add that just like the other topics we discussed and as you might have guessed, this translates very well to investing and also to pretty much anything in your life:

\- **Learn how to break down complex situations.** Logical thinking paired with a statistical approach will help you break down any complex problem into several easier problems, making the whole thing a lot easier to approach/comprehend.

\- **Base your decisions on a methodical and rational approach.** List every possible outcome along with its associated upside/downside, estimate the probability of each outcome to occur and make the best decision based on the information available.

My point here is that risk management, emotional management and statistics/game theory are all awesome tools that you should definitely add to your arsenal. Not only will it improve your money-management and investing, it will also be beneficial to your decision-making and to your life in general. Of course poker is not the only way to learn about these, but I personally found it to be the best practice ground to refine and improve them, which is why I strongly encourage you all to try it out and study the game. 

I hope you enjoyed the article, and I wish you all a happy 2021 bull run! May we all come closer to retirement and financial independence!

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR:*** *more than a game, poker is a school of thought. It teaches you to be reasonable, to assess the risk of every single choice you make, to overcome you emotions, to play the long game rather than the short game, to make informed decisions, etc… This has made me a lot wiser in every aspect of my life, which is why I strongly encourage to try it out and read about poker strategy.*",CryptoCurrency,Why you should learn poker and game theory (LONG READ)

To be able to comprehend staking, you first need to know about Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work. Here is a quick summary.

* **⛏ Proof-of-Work** (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used to decide which blockchain network users are eligible to create a new block. For an entity to be selected and able to choose the next block, they’ll have to solve a particular mathematical problem.
* **💼 Proof-of-Stake** (PoS) is another consensus mechanism to determine which users get to create new blocks on the blockchain. With this method, you don’t need to solve a mathematical problem, and thus, you’ll need less computing power and energy. New block creators are selected by the amount of wealth they’ve locked-up in the network.

An often asked question is if PoS is more secure then PoW. Even though every blockchain network is different and has its level of risk, a common chance with a blockchain is the 51% attack; this poses a hypothetical situation in which miners with more than 50% of the computational power of PoW blockchains would permanently own the blockchain. And thus be able to change transactions and have the possibility to double-spend cryptocurrencies. Now, that’s not something anyone would want to happen since this destroys the fundamentals of the blockchain.

For PoW systems, for such an attack to occur, miners would need to have more than 50% of computational power (and a lot of hardware), so we could say that this is almost impossible. For a 51% attack to happen on PoS systems, someone would need to own over 50% of all available tokens. With most systems having large market capitalizations in the millions of dollars, we could also say that this is near to impossible. Furthermore, buying assets from a network inflates the price of the token. If you’d to try and buy half a network worth of symbols, it would eventually just become too expensive. Plus, once you’d own most of the network, you don’t have the interest to attack it since your ownership would lose value as well. And so, in this aspect, PoS could be considered more secure.

&amp;#x200B;

# Benefits of Staking

So, why would you stake your crypto assets? Staking cryptocurrencies offers several advantages. First, staking your assets through PoS avoids being diluted by inflation. Nonetheless, the value of your staked tokens can be affected by fluctuations in the currency price.

Furthermore, a significant benefit of staking digital assets is that it doesn’t require expensive hardware, which makes it more accessible to a broad public. Thirdly, staking offers a quasi-guaranteed return and a predictable source of income when measured in tokens. Also, it is more environmentally friendly to invest in PoS because it doesn’t require high amounts of energy, like with mining in PoW networks.

&amp;#x200B;

# Risks of Staking

As with any investment, staking cryptocurrencies isn’t risk-free. So, let’s go over the risks involved.

First, there is the possibility of Slashing; this means your validator or baker can receive punishment for a fault conducted. This mechanism is designed to discourage abnormal behavior. The second, and probably most crucial risk, is crypto volatility, which means that some cryptocurrencies exposed to rapid and unexpected change. If it’s for the better, these changes can be helpful and very profitable. However, the downside is that it can depreciate the price of your tokens too much, leaving you empty-handed.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

There are many reasons why it would be attractive to start staking cryptocurrencies. However, before you get started, do your research. It will guarantee that you find the right currencies, wallet, and operator for your needs. Always search for 3rd parties and reviews when researching a cryptocurrency or operator.

This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal, investment, or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, investment, or accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.

I am a certified public accountant that is based out of New Jersey, and I’m going to attempt to write up an extensive guide covering the interactions of United States tax law and cryptocurrency. To begin, I’ll be covering the very basics, and then move on to more complex topics over the coming days.

The IRS uses the term virtual currency to describe a digital representation of value that is convertible into a 'real' currency. Any cryptocurrency that you have purchased on an exchange would fall under this broad definition. The IRS manages to be fairly straightforward in how they treat cryptocurrency transactions: they are considered property, and follow the same rules that come with the disposition of property.

You dispose of property when you do any of the following:

* Sell property.
* Exchange one property for another property.
* You give property away. This is *generally* a non-taxable event for the giver and recipient. A recipient should know your adjusted basis in the property.

This treatment results in a need to diligently track your cryptocurrency transactions, including the converted value of the cryptocurrency to USD at the time of each taxable transaction that you engage in.

Before we get started, let's take a look at what kind of property cryptocurrency is. To do this, we will take a look at [Publication 544](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544) and scrolling down to the second section: [Ordinary or Capital Gain or Loss](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p544#idm139755998734656). Scrolling down further, we can see that capital assets are defined as **everything** you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment. Capital assets are then split off into subcategories, the two largest being **personal-use property** and **investment property**. The main distinction here: investment property is purchased with the intent to sell it at a later time. This distinction is important, as the investment property classification allows your capital losses to be deducted. Note: if you have capital losses in excess of your capital gains in a year, the highest amount of your deduction is $3,000. If you have losses greater than $3,000, you can carry over the excess to future years.

To summarize: cryptocurrency is investment property, which requires recognition of capital gains, but allows recognition of capital losses when it is sold or exchanged.

The first step in understanding the tax consequences of your transactions is to find your [adjusted basis](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2019_publink100010382). This part is fairly simple: how much did you pay, in USD, to purchase your investment? If you were on Coinbase, and spent $50 on 100\~ XLM and a $1.99 Coinbase fee, then your adjusted basis is simply $50.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3o7ntn4fvgj61.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd764cd6f6301924902a5f540407759657344547

To summarize: the adjusted basis is the amount paid for your cryptocurrency, including any fees.

The second step in determining any tax consequences of your transactions is: did I create a taxable event? The vast majority of investors will only create taxable events with sales and exchanges.

The treatment of exchanges requiring recognition tends to frustrate many cryptocurrency investors. As all cryptocurrency is considered property, every time you convert one cryptocurrency for another, you have caused a taxable event to take place. This is a nightmare for anyone engaging in large volumes of trading in multiple different currencies.

If you believe that you did create a taxable event, the next question to ask yourself is: what did I receive in this sale, or exchange? This is called the [amount realized](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2019_publink100010429). In the eyes of the IRS: receiving a toaster for your cryptocurrency, or receiving $60 to purchase a toaster with is the same. The only thing that matters is determining the value of whatever you received, plus any cash that went along with the transaction at the time it happened. If you had to pay a fee for your sale or exchange, that would reduce your amount realized. Let's pretend that you waited for your XLM to appreciate, converted it into $55.06 of Ethereum, and paid a $1.99 transaction fee. Your amount realized comes out to $53.07.

To summarize: the amount realized is any cash you received, plus the fair market value of any property received, minus any fees paid.

Our capital gain or loss is finished up with a simple subtraction.

Amount realized - adjusted basis = Gain/(loss)

​Ultimately, the classification of property is a mixed bag, leading some things to be more confusing and cumbersome than they ought to be, but also providing certain tax benefits that may not be able to be taken advantage of otherwise.

Hopefully this high level overview was helpful. Over the next coming days, I plan to write more about the interactions of cryptocurrency and tax. These will include:

* wash sales
* the gifting of cryptocurrency
* the handling of transaction fees during nontaxable events
* some assumptions about how IRS treatment will change as time goes on

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them below. They can relate to the items above or about anything else that is tax related.

Finally, this is probably my first write-up since college (lol), and I would love to hear any and all criticism.

A few highlights because they are kind of long: 

1. Be civil - don't call other users names, don't use offensive language (certain words that are sprinkled generously around subs like /r/wsb or /r/4chan are not welcome here), etc.
2. Don't post referral links or codes, don't request people to PM you for codes, etc.
3. Don't link threads elsewhere to drive people here (no VM or brigading)
4. Keep discussion on-topic - don't go into unrelated threads to shill 
5. No meta discussion - use modmail or /r/cryptocurrencymeta

Finally, we added a new rule relatively recently:

&gt;Moderators may ask users to provide proof for any personal  cryptocurrency related stories that reach the front page. Refusing to  provide reasonable proof may lead to post removal and/or a possible ban.   

We haven't asked anyone for proof-of-gainz the last few days, but if you're going to post a sob story or a success story, please be prepared for the eventuality that we may actually ask you for proof and ban you if you don't deliver.

Make some time to test your own security. Imagine or recreate a situation where you can't access your usual devices. Will you be able to get your authenticators running again? How will you get your wallets up again?

""Your keys, your crypto"" is comforting, and knowing how to use the scribbled notes in your safe is far better than just vaguely knowing you could. In a test you might discover that something is missing, or you can't read your own handwriting.

1624015914,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o2mznn/why_you_get_downvoted/,810,133,"OK, obviously I can’t tell you why YOU are getting downvoted, but possibly my personal data will provide general insight.

There seems to be renewed concern about downvoting, based on recent posts. We all know (or think, anyway) that Moon Greed has caused an escalation in downvotes. I feel like something of an expert in downvotes, because I get a ton of them. I suspect it’s because I don’t care much about Moons, and don’t temper my comments if I have something unpopular to say.

Anyway, just for fun I did a deep dive into my downvotes over the last 6 months, to see if it might enlighten me as to the types of comments that collect the most downvotes, at least for me. I took all comments that received more than two net downvotes, and subdivided them into self-defined categories. Here’s a pie graph, followed by more detailed notes on category definitions:

https://i.imgur.com/VRS4FfD.jpg

**Some general notes**

This is six months of data, from two accounts. I used to post here with another account, but I lost access to that account, so post from this one now.

I have only included *comments*, not original posts. People who comment on others’ posts far outweigh people who create their own posts, and it’s my hunch that many downvotes on *posts* come from people who didn’t read beyond the title. So data on comments only seems more relevant.

I also did not go beyond 3rd level comments, as things often degenerate into *ad hominem *attacks with deeper nesting.

**Specific notes on categories**

**NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON NANO**: I received a total of 297 downvotes for shit-talking NANO, on a total of 21 comments.

**NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON ETH**: I received a total of 211 downvotes for shit-talking ETH, on a total of 48 comments.

**NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON SAFEMOON**: I received a total of 198 downvotes for shit-talking Safemoon, on a total of 22 comments.

If you do the math, NANO has by far the highest downvote per comment ratio, and if you worry about downvotes, I’d say refrain from saying anything negative about it. It’s clear that saying bad things about any of those three cryptos will bring out downvoters more than any other comment type. Why is that?

One could frame this positively, as unrelenting loyalty to the downvoters’ bags; neutrally, as deep subconscious doubt about their chosen project’s viability; or negatively, as merely a high propensity for butthurt. I won’t venture to guess which one of those predominates.

**COMMENTS SUGGESTING DECENTRALIZATION IS GIVEN UNDUE IMPORTANCE**

I am all for decentralization. I just believe the expectations of many on this sub are unreasonable in that regard. Further, I believe it’s become a buzzword, and that many who use it don’t quite get what it means. In any case, offering either of those beliefs will probably not be well-received. I total, I received 179 downvotes on 31 comments in this group.

**REASON FOR DOWNVOTES UNCLEAR**

Of the downvotes included in this data set, there were 171, on 107 comments, for which I could not identify an obvious motive.

**NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON OTHER CRYPTOS**

This represents a range of cryptos, but does not include the three biggies mentioned in the first three categories. There are many cryptos I don’t really believe in, and my comments are spread over them too thinly to be worth separating into their own categories. These comments were not generally caustic, just bearish. This includes simply questioning the crypto, without claiming something explicitly negative. 120 downvotes on 37 comments of this nature.

**POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT DOGE**

I want to be clear that I don’t hold DOGE, and have never claimed it was a solid project. I traded it for a time, but never considered it a long term hold. When DOGE hate was at its peak, people ranted about it without regard for facts, and I often pointed this out. So by ‘positive,’ I just mean “Well, DOGE does have a legit use case; it’s just not great at it,” as opposed to “DOGE to the moon, boys!” I gathered 100 downvotes on 27 comments where I apparently failed to apply blind hate to DOGE.

**POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT DAY/MARGIN TRADING**

I day trade stocks. That’s my job. So I day trade some cryptos, too. I make money at it consistently, so I don’t understand the general attitude I detect here that it’s pure gambling, and a guaranteed way to lose money. It’s not for everyone, it requires tight risk control, and there’s a learning curve. But people here dismiss it out of hand. I’ve occasionally tried to provide perspective, and usually get downvoted for it. 84 downvotes on 11 comments.

**GENERAL IRONY**

Sometimes I’m a smartass, and comment ironically. Sometimes people just don’t get it. I won’t speculate as to whether it’s my fault or theirs. 75 downvotes on 7 ironic comments that I felt were misinterpreted.

**POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT OTHER COINS**

DOGE not included. Occasionally I’ve been downvoted for chiming in with a supportive comment about ADA, HBAR, ALGO, or something else. I received 74 downvotes on 26 comments where I said something good about a specific coin.

**POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT COINBASE OR BINANCE**

Again, I want to clarify. I am not a shill for either of these huge exchanges. They have their issues. But for me, experiences have been largely positive, and when I feel that someone is exaggerating how evil they are, I will relate my own experience. I got 36 downvotes for 11 comments that were seen as “making excuses” for exchanges when they caused problems for their users.

I don’t know if any of this helps anyone, but it was fun putting it together.",CryptoCurrency,Why you get downvoted

# Introduction:(FAQ Down Below)

**What are Community Points?**

Community Points are a way for Redditors to own a piece of their favorite communities. As a unit of ownership, Points capture some of the value of their community. They can be spent on premium features and are used as a measure of reputation in the community.

**Get rewarded for your work**

People earn Points by contributing to the community, for example by submitting quality posts and comments. Based on these contributions, the community ultimately decides how many Points each person receives.

[https://www.reddit.com/community-points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points)

Governance polls

**What is A Governance Poll?**

With great power comes great responsibility

In subreddits that have Community Points, polls have two sets of results:

1. The normal count, where one member gets one vote.
2. The weighted count, where members get one vote for every Point they have.

In Cryptocurrency Our points are called ""Moons"" as most of you already know.

Every month any member in our community can propose an alternative Distribution of Moons .

**Governance Poll** is a Proposal poll that represent the Idea of the new alternative, One should make a post describing their Proposal and make a Poll so the rest of the Community members can vote on.

If you want to read More about Governances Polls feel free to check my other post who goes into much more details about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lmlrir/governances\_polls\_moon\_polls\_what\_are\_they\_why\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lmlrir/governances_polls_moon_polls_what_are_they_why_do/)

# #FAQ

# Earning Moons:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: How can I Earn Moons?**
* **A:** First you have to open up your vault Via Reddit Mobile app, after that you can earn moons by posting and commenting in this sub. ([https://www.reddit.com/community-points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points) You can open your vault through here)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: How many Moons can I earn and When do I get them?**
* **A:** Moons are distributed monthly based on individual contributions (comments, posts, etc.) that people make in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/). Reddit karma provides a basis for measuring people’s contribution, but the final decision is up to the community. Initially, 50 million Moons will be distributed based on karma earned in the subreddit to date. The amount distributed each following month will start at 5 million and decrease by 2.5% every cycle, so that the total number of Moons distributed over time will approach a maximum cap of 250 million.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: So How many moons do I get per Karma?**
* A: The ratio of Karma : Moons Changes every month, we can't know for sure how much Moons will you earn from Each karma point, Last Round it was  0.51 moons per karma.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: How do Downvotes -Negative Point on posts and comments effect Moons?**
* A: Downvotes Affect your net Karma over the entire round, so if you have a comment with 10 Points and another one with -10 Points they will cancel each other at the distribution.                    One thing to keep in mind is that if for example you had only one comment in the entire round and the comment had negative score , you will not be getting More Moons (OFC) **But Negative Karma don't take the moons that you currently have.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: How can I know when moons are distribute or see past distribution?**
* **A:** Follow [u/CommunityPoints](https://www.reddit.com/user/CommunityPoints) posts and you will be able to see it all.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: What is the Price of Moons?**
* A:  Take a look at Coingecko Page for more information [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moon)

# Moons Usability:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: What can I do with the Moons I earned?**

1. **A:** Currently you can Send Moons Via Reddit, Receive Moons to your vault or Sell Moons Via couple of ways (Uniswap, Honeyswap for ex)
2. You can Convert Moons to ""Reddit Coins"" that will **Only be usable at** [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency)
3. You Buy a Special Membership for this sub for 1000 Moons **Per Month** .

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: Will there be more uses for moons in the future?**
* **A:** YES, I Don't want to spoil anything but the mods are working on some exciting features.

# Governance Polls:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: What is my Voting power?**
* **A:** You can only Vote with the amount of Moons you **Earned, If you earned 2000 moons (in the past) and bought 5000 more, your voting power will be 2000.**
* If you earned 2000 Moons, sold 1000, Bought 1000 back will your voting power will back to be 2000!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: Do I lose my moons if I vote on one of the polls?**
* **A:** No! you don't lose a single moon from voting, Vote away!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q:  Can I make any Moon proposal that I want ?**
* **A: Yes and No,** Yes you are free to make Proposals but not all of them are implementable, for Example we can take a look at:

[Proposal to give 0 karma for MOON distribution to copy and paste meme posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lm8rhl/proposal_to_give_0_karma_for_moon_distribution_to/)

Last Month this Proposal has passed the threshold but the idea behind the proposal is too hard to implement According to [u/jwinterm](https://www.reddit.com/user/jwinterm) comment [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lw0f6q/proposal_to_move_all_memes_to_a_different/gpf1kn2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  , so before making a new proposal stop and think for a min if its possible to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

* Q: **What are the terms for a poll to pass?**
* A: For a poll to pass, its winning option needs to have enough Moons to meet a decision threshold. This decision threshold will be set to a minimum of 10% of the Moons supply to start with. The decision threshold will automatically update once a week. At that time, the new decision threshold will be calculated as the average of the existing threshold and the number of Moons cast in favor of the most highly-voted option in governance polls over the last 4 weeks. There will still be a 10% minimum of the existing Moons supply (it can't go lower than that).

&amp;#x200B;

* **Q: How many Proposals can pass each round?**
* **A:** Up until yesterday I thought that only one Proposal could pass each Round , [According to](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lw0f6q/proposal_to_move_all_memes_to_a_different/gpewylk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [u/nanooverbtc](https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc) each round isn't limited to one poll only , It's possible that **Few** proposals will pass! **But**  if two proposals that are directly competing will pass the threshold, **Only**  the one with most votes in favor will Pass Be Counted!.

&amp;#x200B;

* Q: What is the Difference between **MOON distribution** governance poll and **community governance** polls?
* A:

1. **Moon Distribution governance poll** \- Has to be approved by **Reddit Admins** and meet their voting requirements, which are currently 10% of all MOONs voting for one passing option.
2. **Community governance polls** \- has to be accepted by the **Subreddit Mods** and meet their requirements, Currently 10% aswell, for example the poll - [Proposal to move all memes to a different subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lw0f6q/proposal_to_move_all_memes_to_a_different/) is a **Community governance poll**.    
3.  **\*\*\*Important Note about Community governance poll\*\*\*  : Before** submitting an Community governance poll make sure to seek feedback by modmail before opening the Poll.

1635800514,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qknq2v/why_crypto_wont_make_most_of_us_rich/,1886,149,"Very few believe in crypto to the degree necessary for it to make you rich (short of complete luck meme coin mooning).

They aren’t going in hard enough.
$100, even if your crypto goes 100x, is not making you rich. Or you are constantly jumping from one “opportunity” to another, instead of committing as absolutely hard as you can to what projects you believe in.

And they will sell far too early.

When they have enough to get out of debt. When they need a down payment on a house. When they panic after a crash. When life happens.

Their day to day reality will be more real than the hope of a radically different future.

No judgment here. If crypto improves your life, it’s still a win. But it’s not what it could have been.

I first got into crypto 5 years ago, but “life happened”. I thought I needed the money. Knowing I could now have 100x as much money, I see that I didn’t need it as much as I thought. 

But now I know, and I’m back in. As financially and emotionally committed as I possibly can be. Because I refuse to find myself feeling this same way 5 years from now.

And whatever obstacles that come up, I will deal with them as if my crypto investments don’t exist. Me from 5 years from now will thank me.",CryptoCurrency,Why crypto won’t make most of us rich

I haven't seen a post about this so far but DOT currently sits at $49.81 and recently hit its new ath of $49.91. I didn't expect it to fly under the radar to be honest.

It's pretty well known that DOT has been trading sideways for a while now, ever since the bear market dip earlier this year but maybe this is polkadot's time to shine and finally have its explosive upside trend. 

I want to congratulate everyone who held onto their DOT and everyone who bought it when it dipped all the way down to $12 during the bear market.",CryptoCurrency,Did people miss that DOT just hit a new ATH?
1614789199,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lwy1a0/unpopular_opinion_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_are/,285,140,"I see all the time “Don’t hold money in an exchange!!” Or “Not your keys, not your crypto!!” and what not all over r/CC. 

I’d like to lay out some personal pros and cons for CoinBase.

CoinBase advantages:

• They let you transfer some coins WITHOUT fees. I am able to turn my mined ETH to most other crypto without it costing me anything! I can even turn it into some stable coins (like DAI) without fees! With ETH gas fees so high, this is HUGE.

• CoinBase owns over 970,000 BTC. This creates a physical backing for the BTC you have in CoinBase.

• Even if you store your crypto offline, you’ll eventually have to move it to an exchange to sell or use it. (In the USA, the IRS does not allow for the transaction of crypto outside exchanges)

• CoinBase is about to release their IPO soon making their business practices fall under SEC regulation. This helps me feel confident that the company is less likely to do shady stuff if they have to answer to the US gov and shareholders

CoinBase disadvantages:

• Customer service is slow. I didn’t receive my 5 dollar BTC verification bonus and had to file a support ticket. It took about a week for them to process my ticket and give me my money. Unfortunately, most exchanges have similar reputations for customer service.

• Fees for cashing in or out are high for CoinBase (fairly good for CoinBase Pro though!)

• If you are the “bury gold in the back yard bc you don’t trust banks” type, then you won’t like that you don’t actually own the keys for the crypto you own


Conclusion:

I’m not saying other exchanges are bad (I’ve heard good things about Kraken and such) but I’m saying we can’t be too afraid of exchanges either. If you’re holding hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of crypto, I can see why you may want additional levels of security for your assets. However the vast majority of us are only dealing in the 10’s, 100’s or 1000’s of dollars worth of crypto making it easier (and imo smarter) to hold it on an exchange like CoinBase.",CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: CoinBase and CoinBase Pro are good exchanges and OK to hold crypto in

***The full blog post with all the tables is*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17)***.***

Welcome all (especially newcomers) to the monthly recap for the 3rd of 4 homemade Top Ten Crypto Index Funds. The 2020 Portfolio is made up of: **Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Tether, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, BitcoinSV,** and **Tezos.**

**MOON DROP!:** *76* *Moons to the first person to name the artist and title of the hidden song in this post AND share which of these 2020 Top Ten cryptos will outperform the others in June. Why 76? That's worth about $5 (76\*.066) at the moment, my way of encouraging the winner to become a* [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) *special member, which runs $5/month.* To give more people a chance you can't win if you've already won this month.

**tl;dr:**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly. Did the same in 2019, 2020, and 2021. ***Learn more about the Experiment history, rules, and FAQs (including the answer to the ""WHY TETHER?!?!"" question)*** [***here***](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/about/)***.***
* **Top Performer of May** \- Besides **USDT? EOS**, only down -3% in May.
* **Overall since Jan. 2020** \- **BNB** still well ahead and best performing of any of the cryptos in any of the four Top Ten Experiments, up **+2,523%** in 17 months. The 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has the highest ROI of the four Experiments.  Last place **BSV** doubling ROI of S&amp;P over same time period.
* An ode to DCA: **2018+2019+2020+2021 Combined Top Ten Portfolios are returning 349%.**

## Month Seventeen – UP 630%

[ 2020 Top Ten Summary ](https://preview.redd.it/9cdlj03hy6571.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2552fb99a5f4bba4ff9d481bc03e38a2b1b441c4)

After reaching a new high in [April](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16), the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio hit a no-green wall in May.  This month was the first all-red month since June 2020 (LINK).  

Tough month aside, the 2020 Top Ten is still doing very well overall.  Its value is the same as in April and it continues to be the best performing of the four [Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).  100% of the 2020 cryptos are in positive territory, most have at least *triple digit price growth* and two cryptos in *four digit growth territory* (**BNB** and **ETH**).

And the Index Fund approach seems to be working out nicely with the 2020 Top Ten: the **+630%** return has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* It is also doing much better than the S&amp;P 500 over the same period of time (more on that below).

## May Movement Report, Ranking, and Dropouts

A lot of movement this month with 2020 Top Ten cryptos.  All made a move except **BTC** and **ETH**.

Ups:

* **EOS** – up three places (#26–&gt;#23)
* **Tezos** – up three places (#38–&gt;#35)
* **Tether** – up two places (#5–&gt;#3)

Downs:

* **Binance Coin** – down two places (#3–&gt;#5)
* **BSV** – down six places (#28–&gt;#34)
* **Litecoin** – down three places (#11–&gt;#14)
* **XRP** – down three places (#4–&gt;#7)
* **Bitcoin Cash** – down three places and out of the Top Ten (#10–&gt;#13)

[ 2020 Top Ten Rank: a 50&amp;#37; drop out rate ](https://preview.redd.it/8oii5lqyz6571.png?width=409&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a418604eeb85e28a92df51aa32054fdd54a01c7)

**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020:**  after seventeen months, half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out:  **EOS**, **BSV, Tezos, Litecoin,** and most recently **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano,** **Polkadot, UNI, Doge,** and **USDC.**

**EOS** is out of the Top *Twenty* and **XTZ** and **BSV** are both out of the Top *Thirty.*

## May Winners and Losers 

***May Winners*** – stablecoin **Tether.  EOS** dropped only -3%, essentially breaking even for the month.

***May Losers*** –  **BSV** lost nearly half of its value, finishing the month down -46%. **Binance Coin** also had a rough May, dropping -40%.

## Tally of Monthly Winners and Losers

After seventeen months, here’s a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment’s monthly winners and losers:

[ 2020 Top Ten Ws and Ls ](https://preview.redd.it/wzy52tp207571.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e3a056408a3dda32db84485ba71f9943a9e3e83)

With four monthly victories, **ETH** is still in the lead.  **Tether** still has the most monthly losses, but **BSV** is starting to catch up. 

## Overall Update – BNB and ETH well in the lead, 100% of cryptos in positive territory, worst performer (BSV) up +77%.

The 2020 Top Ten continue to outpace the other [Top Ten Crypto Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/).  Most cryptos are up at least triple digits.  **Ethereum** and **Binance Coin** are up quadruple digits.

Frontrunner **BNB** gains since January 2020?  The initial $100 investment into **Binance Coin** is currently worth **$2,624**, an increase of +2,523%.   

In second is **Ethereum,** also with quadruple digit gains, up +1950%.

Besides **USDT**, the worst performer in the 2020 group is **BSV.**  But even **BSV’s** \+77% gains are over double those of the S&amp;P over the same period of time (see below).

## Total Market Cap for the Entire Cryptocurrency Sector:

[ Total Crypto Market Cap since Jan 2020 ](https://preview.redd.it/dpvx9uj707571.png?width=1063&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=702338baf5225973062dd7385e5e276ede5ff5d6)

Even though the total market cap lost $570 billion in May, it is up **+765%** over the seventeen month lifespan of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.  May’s dip did, however, break a seven streak of record market caps for the 2020 Top Ten Experiment.   

If you were able to capture the entire crypto market since [January 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) (+765%), you’d be doing a bit better than the Experiment’s Top Ten approach (+630%) and much better than the S&amp;P (+30%) over the same time period.  The index fund strategy has outperformed eight of the ten individual cryptos held within the index.  Only by guessing correctly on **ETH** or **BNB** would you have beaten the Top Ten Index Experiment’s approach.   

## Bitcoin Dominance:

[BitDom at a 2020 Experiment Low](https://preview.redd.it/y3kywx5a07571.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fc927826b0d7907ac215315d4b14495c72d3b94)

Another big drop for **BitDom** in May – and this month’s 42% is the lowest level so far in the life of the 2020 Experiment.  Second lowest? [Last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16).  

## Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2020:

[2020 Top Ten Portfolio ROI](https://preview.redd.it/m34lemth07571.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c5f62f60f10b3a15455701de93e2f4ab380a9bc)

May saw a significant drop in the total value of the 2020 Top Ten portfolio: the initial $1000 investment is now worth **$7,300**, up +630% (this portfolio was worth **$10,5236** just [last month](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-16)). Despite the dip, the 2020 Portfolio is still the best performing of [the four Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/). 

Below is a month by month ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Experiment, to give you a sense of perspective and provide an overview as we go along:

[ Monthly ROI of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio ](https://preview.redd.it/qwvxi0jl07571.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0546913a0d40f73f323f9a7182d77dd9f37e7894)

\+630% is down from last month’s record, but is still the second highest monthly ROI since the start of the 2020 Experiment.  The portfolio has yet to experience a red month, but a little over a year ago in [March 2020](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-3/) it came close, returning a COVID induced low of +7%.

**Combining the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios** 

So, where do we stand if we combine four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* [2018 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-41): up +26% (total value $1,264)
* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-29): up +459% (total value $5,594)
* [2020 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-17): up +630% (total value $7,300)
* [2021 Top Ten Experiment](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-5): up +281% (total value $3,809)

Taking the four portfolios together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line: 

**After a $4,000 investment in the 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$17,967** ($1,264 + $5,594 + $7,300 + $3,809).

**That’s up +349%** on the combined portfolio.  It’s a big drop from last month, but looking at the big picture, the combined portfolios are back to where they were two months ago in [March](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-15). 

Lost in the numbers? Here’s a table to help visualize the progress of the combined portfolios:

***That’s a +349% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st for four straight years***. 

## Top Ten Index Approach vs. All-In Approach

But what if I’d gone all in on only one Top Ten crypto for the past four years? While many have come and gone over the life of the experiment, five cryptos have started in the Top Ten for all four years: **BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH,** and **LTC.** Let’s take a look:

[ If playing by the Experiment rules, it's ETH by a landslide](https://preview.redd.it/fdu062xr07571.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd1f4441737013282637de8f2d1f2539f484c2c)

**ETH** is well in the lead and the still best “if-I-had-a-time-machine” choice.  As of today, $4,000 into Ethereum in $1k chunks on four consecutive New Year’s Days would be worth **$47,562**. That’s up **+1089%**.  

In second place, going all in on **Bitcoin** with $4,000 USD would have yielded **+377%**, turning the initial investment into **$19,089**.  

And close third place? The Top Ten Index Fund approach!  Watch your back, **BTC**!

As you might expect (as indexes are designed to mitigate risk), the **+349%** gains of the Top Ten Index Fund approach fall somewhere in between the best and worst performers.  The Top Ten strategy isn’t keeping up with **ETH** or **BTC** (yet) but it is outperforming a hypothetical all-in investment in both **XRP, LTC,** and **BCH** by a healthy margin.

**Bitcoin Cash** would have been the worst four year all-in bet, but you’d still be +144%.  

So that’s the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments snapshot. Let’s take a look at how traditional markets are doing.

## Comparison to S&amp;P 500

I’m also tracking the S&amp;P 500 as part of my experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets. May saw yet another all time high for the S&amp;P, which has now returned +30% since January 1st, 2020.

[ S&amp;P, up +30&amp;#37; in 17 months ](https://preview.redd.it/3amtfgrw07571.png?width=762&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c70d296bf102e56d02ddb3749869d5848fc25a)

Solid returns for a period of time largely dominated by a pandemic. This more than triples the 8%/year figure that many financial planners use for predicted annual market returns.  

That same [$1k I put into crypto](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) in January 2020 would be worth $1300 had it been redirected to the S&amp;P 500 instead. 

Crypto over the same time period? The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio is returning **+630%**. The initial $1k investment in crypto is now worth **$7,300**. 

***That’s a difference of $6,000***. 

***On a $1k investment!*** 

But that’s just 2020. What about in the longer term? What if I invested in the S&amp;P 500 the same way I did during the first four years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments since January 1st, 2018? What I like to call the world’s slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures:

* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1570 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1680 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1300 today
* $1000 investment in S&amp;P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1120 today

So, taken together, here’s the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&amp;P: 

**After four $1,000 investments into an S&amp;P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, my portfolio would be worth $5,670** ($1,570 + $1,680 + $1,300 + $1,120)

That is up **+42%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+349%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios, a difference of 307% ***in favor of crypto.***

To help provide perspective, here’s a quick look at the combined four year ROI for crypto vs. the S&amp;P up to this point.

[ Combined crypto vs. combined S&amp;P ](https://preview.redd.it/s7j3yp4417571.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=804b0318cbcdb279926d6c950ac9abf5ca5de3f3)

Even though May was a down month for crypto, overall that’s eight straight monthly wins for crypto.

## Conclusion:

After feeling [unstoppable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G-cBND9cN4) for months, the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio, along with the rest of crypto, took a big hit in May. Whether this turns out to be a temporary setback or the bull run is done remains to be seen.  The next few months should be interesting, hold on to something/one. 

For those who have supported the Experiments over the years, thank you.  For those just getting into crypto, I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, think long term, don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and most importantly, enjoy the ride!

Simply put, a death cross is when the 50D SMA falls below the 200D SMA and can foreshadow a major sell-off and/or confirm a bear market. When looking back since BTC's inception, we can see several instances whereby a death cross occurred and either did or didn't weigh materially on price. Since many of these crosses occurred during a bear market, it came as no surprise that the death cross was followed by further downward pressure. However, with the death cross on pace to form in a little less than a week, some are concerned that said cross will send price lower and may even confirm BTC being in a bear market. Here's why that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. If you're too lazy to read [here's a great video by Benjamin Cowen about previous death crosses.](https://youtu.be/rWW2t6CynCo)

  
**Death Cross 1:** March 25, 2020

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nv988jy71u571.png?width=3106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c13c1a4cc227c21afed7ea742d724d265dde1058

* This death cross came off the back of March 2020's notorious ""Black Thursday.""
* Price went on to correct -16% over a 5-day period before regaining momentum and trending higher.
* What's most notable about this death cross is that BTC was already making higher-highs leading into the cross itself. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of BTC's forthcoming death cross.

  
**Death Cross 2: October 26, 2019**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c9l1zo7b1u571.png?width=3100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b25847e4c141f9247709a600d056f23dc73c34b0

* This death cross came several months after BTC hit a local high of roughly $13,400 in June and then entered into a downtrend. 
* On the day of the death cross, BTC surged as much as +19% before then resuming its downtrend. BTC also went on to trend lower into year-end.
* While we can clearly see that BTC exploded +40% between October 25 &amp; 26, many forget that what drove this move higher was China's President Xi [saying](https://click.marketing.kraken.com/?qs=95594a81bee38b6e426ab1daaaeb4e977e85b68e5ea1f5b58d855d992b2fbccbbc959d3178a3d5daecf31836732a8f1ed1fa41489daf2a6e) the country should ""seize opportunity"" to adopt blockchain.

  
**Death Cross 3: March 31, 2018**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azqnkcdd1u571.png?width=3102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edeb8afffb8c554216dc88e8cc7efbb96f4481f2

* When this death cross occurred, it was already apparent to many that BTC was in a bear market. Anyone who was in the market at this time knew that 2017 was absolutely bonkers and BTC's blow-off top from $20K was likely the beginning of the end.
* That said, although BTC only corrected -11.5% in the two days that followed, BTC went on to ultimately trend lower despite rallying considerably higher in April 2018

  
**Death Cross 4: September 14, 2015**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ps8xz77j1u571.png?width=3102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b93ff3fc66acd6cc3f05a014067b51d264f078

* This death cross stands out quite a bit, mostly because it came 9 months after BTC set a bear market bottom in January.
* Not only that, but BTC went on to rally nearly +120% into the first week of November. BTC would go on to correct -40% before regaining momentum and entering into its next bull market cycle.
* Lastly, you can see that this death cross coincided with no material move to the downside, price largely traded sideways.

  
**Death Cross 5: September 4, 2014**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g52tw2ql1u571.png?width=3104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e04b59c8f81598c4b0e5d8262e26ac0844013b7

* As with most other death crosses, BTC was already in a bear market when this cross occurred and many knew it at the time. 
* Furthermore, price was largely unchanged in the days that followed this cross. However, BTC did go on to sell-off meaningfully in the weeks that followed before slipping lower as the bear market carried on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Death Cross 6: April 9, 2014**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qliukxon1u571.png?width=3108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb8cdc4608935d57653a2b71fde761b1c9cf8ff6

* Leading up to this death cross, BTC was in a downtrend for months and off -65% from its all-time high of \~$1,200 set in November 2013. That said, it comes as no surprise that what followed this death cross was further weakness.
* Perhaps what was surprising was the fact that BTC would correct more than -25% in the next couple of days that followed.
* BTC would go on to bounce higher and press to a local high of $550 come mid-April and even $680 in June, but BTC's inability to set a higher-high in the macro trend only resulted in BTC continuing its slump lower.

  
**Death Cross Avoided: August 2013**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y7ksqbfp1u571.png?width=3096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d98bbf31543039d2840d7daed0943c8c987f286

* In all of BTC's history, August 2013 was the only instance where a death cross was just barely avoided. 
* BTC's ability to rally higher after roaring to an all-time high of $280 and correcting -83% caught many by surprise. The abrupt rebound is ultimately how BTC dodged scoring a death cross.
* As everyone knows, BTC would go on to climb as high as $1,200 before entering into a bear market.

**So, What Does It All Mean???**  


With the exception of a few, many of BTC's death crosses coincided either with 1). a sell-off in the days that followed and/or 2). a continued macro downtrend that confirmed a bear market. Sometimes there was even a brief pump. That said, one ought to be open-minded about the forthcoming death cross being accompanied by downside price action and potentially even a continuation of the current downtrend. 

On the flip side, we should also remember that BTC *doesn't have to do anything*. All market cycles are different and there are a number of things that makes this market cycle different from others. With that in mind, one could argue there is just as good of a chance of BTC doing nothing/climbing higher as there is of BTC plunging. At the end of the day, wherever the market converges to is what will happen. Don't expect for anything to occur, but do plan for the worst.",CryptoCurrency,A Death Cross is Looming on the Bitcoin chart.

• HODL

•Buy the dip/slurp the dip/where’s my chips 

• X is just FUD/fuck banks/government 

• Oh this is a great buying opportunity

• bear markets won’t happen like before because this time *its different*

Where does all of this confidence come from? We have multiple posts showing how the top 10 changes on a yearly basis and have evidence that many coins do not reclaim ATH after a prolonged downturn. Most people when they find a great buying opportunity for something aren’t shouting it from the rooftops as it’s usually advantageous to get a deal for ones self. 

There is money to be made in a bear market by either shorting, converting to stable coins and lending/yield farming, or just overall increasing your positions at regular intervals just like everyone who preaches DCA, so why is everyone so quick to just dismiss any possible conversation about this stuff?

* BURST - Honestly have never heard of this until today. It uses proof of capacity for mining and supposedly only uses the power consumed equivalent to your computer idling. 

* NANO - Uses block lattice technology to remain energy efficient while still relying on PoW. 

* MINA - A newer coin intending to use zk-SNARKS and maintain a lightweight blockchain. This one seems intriguing. 

* XLM - Uses a consensus protocol which has a shorter authentication cycle…thereby using less energy.

I used every card available to my area for 1 month minimum.

&amp;#x200B;

**CRYTPO . COM CARD**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g55k22htiji71.jpg?width=1833&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ace2c84a4446b00e394a962ac0ff83a1dadac5b3

[https://crypto.com/us/cards](https://crypto.com/us/cards)

There are a few different options for the user to choose from. There are also a few added benefit as you go up the tiers. It allows you to continue to DCA in to CRO ([crypto.com](https://crypto.com)’s) native token. Rewards start at 1% on every purchase and go up to 8%. The rewards are in CRO. In order to get a card you have to have a certain threshold of CRO staked. 

For this experiment, I staked $400 and got a Ruby Metal card. The Ruby card gives you 2% back in CRO and also reimburses your Spotify membership. You can withdraw up to $400 from an ATM with the Ruby card.

First, the card quality is really nice. I love the metal design. It feels very premium. It interacts with the [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) application seamlessly. The beauty of this card is definitely not lost on people in stores. This sparked up a lot of crypto conversations with various people in stores/public. 

Secondly, the Ruby card offers 2% and a free Spotify subscription that is paid for in CRO. The great part about this is that as you grow your account, you can upgrade your card to Indigo or Jade and get 3% back and also get Netflix paid for. Feel free to follow the link above to all of the cards and their options. 

Overall, I liked the card and the experience I had. I think there is a lot of really great features and allows you to spend your crypto through the card. I recommend this if you are a big [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) user and believer in CRO as a network. 

**7/10**

**Blockfolio by FTS US CARD**

&amp;#x200B;

[FTX CARD](https://preview.redd.it/dz1ql036jji71.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99f16fa83183f9caad47f9b6812751112b9b538d)

The FTX card allows the user to spend any crypto they want using the balance in their FTX account. The beautiful part of the FTX card is that there is no fees to do this. 

The card is plastic and does have a nice design on it. The card also has a chip and is easily managed right inside the FTX application. There is one caveat though. This card, at least during my time of using it, does not have any rewards. In a market where most of the other crypto cards have at least some kind of reward, I found this off putting. 

What does it do right? 

It is super easy and free of fees. There is also a really nice 8% APR on FTX. If you are a regular spender of crypto to fiat, there are other options that would be better. For the occasional hodler, this is a super easy, convenient way to spend your crypto. 

**5/10**

**FOLD**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fyxpzk54kji71.jpg?width=1264&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4972307a01427e66fff12853c7eada2598c1f9c0

The FOLD card. There are 2 different cards. The “Spin” and ”Spin +”. 

[https://foldapp.com/fold-card-plans](https://foldapp.com/fold-card-plans)

This card markets a 25% to 100% back in rewards. The rewards are paid out in BTC. If you are wanting to stack sats in every way possible, this card is a solid option. I do recommend reading the terms of rewards though. It’s not just a 25% on every purchase type of situation. There is a daily spin that you get that can reward some extra sats, spins, etc. Overall the platform is okay at best. It isn’t linked to an exchange in the same way that the other cards in this list are. 

The card came pretty quickly in the mail and allows you to fund your card with fiat instead of crypto. This card is essentially a fiat pre-paid debit card that rewards you in sats. The card itself is plastic and bright yellow. I honestly hated this card. It was a pain in the ass to build up rewards and an even more pain in the ass to redeem them. Of all the cards in the list, this one is by far the worst. 

**2/10**

**COINBASE CARD**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7vfpcxhelji71.jpg?width=909&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf56bdbdb8fe1e83737ef9b068b7b31907655d6

[**https://www.coinbase.com/card**](https://www.coinbase.com/card)

The Coinbase card is tied directly to your coinbase account. There is no staking or any barrier for entry. There is a waitlist inside the coinbase application. I waited for a few months before I was able to get the card. The card allows you to get up to 4% in rewards. There are various coins you can be rewarded in but if you elect to receive 4% in XLM you can change the XLM to any crypto for no fee. 

The only negative that I found from using this card was the conversion fee from converting crypto to USDC. It’s not a bad fee but it is a fee nonetheless. The card itself is plastic and minimal. Nice Coinbase blue. You can add the card to Apple Pay which makes online shopping super easy. 

Overall, I love this card and continue to use this card today. The integration with the Coinbase application allows you to seamlessly buy, sell, spend your crypto however you want to. If this card had no fees like the FTX card, it would be perfect. 

**9.5/10** 

**BITPAY**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aratzuxdmji71.jpg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ea1c8aab61d5210139af52adf9fadf07ad6a847

The BitPay card is reliable, seamless and gives you a little more control. You can use BitPay as an exchange if you want. It offers you the ability to pay with a few different cryptos in an easy to use application. 

The card is plastic in a nice navy blue color. 

The biggest issue I had with this card/app was the amount of fees. This application is more decentralized so you will have to pay gas fees to exchange crypto. ETH fees being super high made this a nightmare. 

Overall, it is easy to use but the fees and the lack of rewards make this a pretty bad card in general. There are just way better options. 

**4/10** 

&amp;#x200B;

I recommend the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) card and Coinbase card above everything else at this point. I will update if I use any others.",CryptoCurrency,I have used and reviewed every major crypto debit card so you don’t have to!
1629477101,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p88qsd/theres_a_new_rcryptocurrency_moon_tipping_leader/,954,125,"According to the unofficial tipping leaderboard I created at [ccmoons.com](https://ccmoons.com), today for the first time in months a new r/CryptoCurrency Moon-tipping leader has emerged!

Since February of this year, the  u/LATech99 has been entrenched at the top, but last night u/Xrporbust claimed the #1 spot with over 660 users tipped! But he shouldn't get too comfortable, u/LargeSnorlax is close behind and primed to overtake!

Great job by all these 3 for keeping tipping culture alive -- and to the many other moon-tippers out there!

**The leaderboard ranking is based on # of distinct users tipped**, since this prevents ""cheating"" the leaderboard by sending tips back and forth between a small group of people. I also track # of Moons tipped, but this is subject to the aforementioned caveat.

u/damnusernamegotcutof leads the total moon-tipped ranking, with over 12,000 Moons tipped! Even more impressive since he has \~5500 Moons right now.

Big shoutouts as well the following users, who are in the top 15 in my leaderboard:

For those interested, I  define a ""tip"" as a transaction of a whole number of moons (from 1-100)  between two accounts that I can verify belong to redditors.

* Tips over 100 I assume to be purchases/bets **unless a user confirms to me that it was a tip**. Of the many &gt;100 txs I reached out to users about, the large majority were not tips.
* Tips of decimal amounts (e.g. 50.14 moons) I don't count -- most of these are transactions to reddit users who run Moon exchanges. Self-tips are also not counted either.
* I can only determine Redditor addresses through the distribution CSV files, so tips won't be registered until both users appear on at least one file. Each distribution all tips are backfilled with these addresses
* I've spot checked the data -- but of course nothing is infallible and there could be bugs.

Many of you may have brought Bitcoin when it went up above 20000$ or higher. At the time of writing this post, 1 Bitcoin = 46200$.

You may have seen your cryptocurrency balance go up 20%, 30% or even 100%. This may have made you interested in buying even more Bitcoin. ""It keeps going up and up, I should buy even more to maximize my profits"", this is the thought I had when I entered the cryptocurrency market in 2017. You may get similar greedy thoughts in your head.  


This is a perfectly expected behavior considering all the positive news you have heard recently about Bitcoin. You have heard Elon Musk talk about Bitcoin. You have seen his tweets promoting Bitcoin. You trust him and think that other large billionaires will probably buy more Bitcoin, which will send it to 100k by July!!!

You may have seen BitBoy and other youtubers say Ethereum is going to 2500$, Bitcoin to 75K or 80K or even 250K!!! To be honest, I was exactly like you on January 2018. I was really hyped about this, though I was smart enough to sell my Ethereum at 1200$ which was my largest holding. I than brought some stupid useless altcoins and you may have done the same recently after selling some of your Bitcoin to buy other smallar coins.  


But you need to understand that something that can go up 40% a day can also dump 40% a day. Let me give you and example with the price of petrol or gasoline. You may have observed that the price of gasoline doesn't always stay the same. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. But the price generally doesn't fluctuate too much.

Here, cryptocurrencies also work exactly in a similar way. Though the price swing is much higher because crypto trades 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Because it can be transferred instantly, it has a higher price volatility.   


So, if you think it can only go up, you are naïve. Higher price volatility means that when it goes up, it goes up really high, but **when it goes down, it goes down really high as well**.

One strategy to protect yourself against such price movements is to average your costs. That is instead of buying crypto at once, you split that into 12 (for example) chunks and buy every month. If you check the price of Bitcoin for the last 12 months, you will realize that if you brought BTC this way, your average price per Bitcoin would be around 15000$ - 20000$ (I didn't do the exact math).

Hence, now that BTC is 46k, you are up over 240%. This is a much safer strategy for new investors. Also, Bitcoin in 2018, went up to 19k and then went down to around 4k, which is about a dump of 80%.

So, it wouldn't be impossible for it to go down back to 10k by going down 80%. I am writing this because I don't want you to make the same mistakes I made though you will still make some mistakes and loss money xD, I know it. After losing a lot of money did I learn to manage my risks. I hope you have a much better experience with your crypto journey.

And **enjoy the memes** and the fun community around here.",CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency 101: If it can go up 500%, it can also go down 80%"
1614085244,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqhw0n/for_some_perspective_lets_take_a_look_at_some_of/,330,431,"It's understandable that some people will be panicking about the price action of the last couple of days, either because you're new and haven't experienced a crash before, or because you've been around long enough to remember the last time we went from a euphoric bullrun to a multi-year bear market and are concerned that it's happening again right now. For the record: I'm not a fan of crashes either!

I don't know what's going to happen next. My *opinion* is that this crash was well overdue and we'll recover and make new highs over the next few months. I could well be wrong, wouldn't be the first time!

A few months back when Bitcoin hit $17k (we were so jubilant- $17k!!!!) I shared these threads and comments as a reminder to take comments in here with a pinch of salt, and I thought that with the current sentiment being what it is, some people might find that taking a look through the daily threads from [March 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fh77ef/daily_discussion_march_12_2020_gmt0/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [March 13th](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/fhqj6t/daily_discussion_march_13_2020_gmt0/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) last year helpful to put things into perspective a bit, and to try not to take all the doom and gloom too seriously (this applies to bullish comments too, because the truth is nobody knows where this is going).

On March 12 last year, the Bitcoin prices plunged 40% from $8000 to $4,800. At the time it felt like the end of the world to many people. (And look how far we've come since then!) Some of the comments are pure gold:

My wife's jobs have taken a big hit financially because of the pandemic. This was especially bad towards the beginning of dealing with COVID. I had a small amount of various cryptocurrencies that I had saved up over time and, although I didn't want to sell them, I sold them in order to get us through our bad financial situation.

I made enough of a small amount of profit on my crypto to give us a little extra income that allowed us to stay afloat during the early parts of the pandemic.

I don't think that we would have made it through if I hadn't sold my crypto and I just wanted to let people know that sometimes you HAVE to sell in order to survive... and that's ok. Food, water, shelter, etc. will always be more important than hanging onto your crypto. You can always accumulate more later.

I have many, many moments these days where I wish I would have been able to hang onto the crypto that I purchased (I would've made a tidy profit from them) but then I remember that I didn't really have much of a choice at the time and I'm proud of myself for investing enough money earlier to get us through a bad patch (instead of spending it frivolously on dumb shit).

I'm sure that there are many people out there with similar stories to mine. Remember to not invest more than you can lose and try to prepare for difficult financial situations. Have some savings, learn how to live frugally, and DCA in the projects that you believe in...because it might just get you through difficulties that you could've never predicted.",CryptoCurrency,A Big Thank You to Crypto

Sounds crazy now right, but when euphoria is high those kind of predictions sound completely reasonable (some people would even bet their dicks on it) and they were all being upvoted. If you'd have said those coins were going to crash 95% (which is what happened) you probably would have been downvoted to oblivion.

I actually think we're still a long way from the peak of this current cycle, but obviously I don't have a clue anymore than anyone else does (who saw the March 2020 crash coming?) But if things continue as they are we're going to be seeing similar price predictions about all kinds of projects over these next few months, so just a friendly reminder to take what you read with a pinch of salt.

Don't be a crypto grandma and believe everything you read, and if you're going to yolo, make sure it's with money you're really ok with losing.

Rules:
- Do your own research. Analyze the project and study white-papers. Combine your decision making with TA
- Be aware of FOMO. Sit out the hype. Value always drops after a pump.
- Always crosscheck FUD messages. 
- Buy the rumors and sell the news. Study upcoming events of your desired project / token.
- Buy low and sell high. Seems easy, but greedy people get burned.
- If someone says HODL, don’t trust it.
- If someone says MOON, don’t trust it.
- If everyone is talking about your token, sell it. 
- Always buy and sell contradictory against the market.
- Diversify your portfolio and spread the risk

 -the following is biased and part of my portfolio-

Search for coins which did not pump yet.

I keep having this thought that over the next two years, we’re going to see a bear market. This has been repeated ad nauseum: PE ratios are way up, margin investing is up, speculation is rampant, there’s a ton of cash flowing into the economy, random stocks are going on monster runs, and up until Biden bombed Syria “stonks only go up” was pretty solid advice. 

So here’s my concern: I believe in the long-term promise of crypto, I think Bitcoin is a rational hedge against bad governance and currency inflation, and other currencies can start to replace large pieces of the banking system. 

Still, if the stock market tanks, will people realize that holding crypto is the right move, or will they/we scatter like rabbits and tank the crypto markets for awhile as well? Will all this discipline and DCAing evaporate? Even though the last week of drops has been explained as Syria on the stock side and market manipulation/sell off on the crypto side, it looks like these markets are all still closely correlated, and I can afford to lose the dollars, but I’d rather not.

With increased institutional investment, these swings could attach to each other more strongly because the same people putting money in securities are also buying crypto. It doesn’t feel like these are very different markets.",CryptoMarkets,Looking for a debate about this concern: what if the stock market goes down?

For most of us normies we can use any help. So let’s talk about benefits and how to take full advantage of it. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally only have a [6banc.com](https://6banc.com) card and a CRO card. Currently only taking advantage of the 6banc 4% Crypto back. To the point that my wife is annoyed every time I throw that sweet blue card at her on every purchase. I have made her wait while I transfer money to USDC. She wants to buy $50 worth of candles? Might as well get that 4% back, right?

&amp;#x200B;

So now I finally reached the amount needed for CRO to get new benefits and I am looking forward to it. If anyone has been using these benefits please share!

As the title says, I'm giving away Nano in this thread! 

Get yourself a wallet if you don't have one:

Natrium ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/natrium/id1451425707?ls=1&amp;mt=8) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.banano.natriumwallet)) or [www.nault.cc](https://www.nault.cc/) (desktop) are recommended; it takes roughly one minute to set up. It's all free.

I'll send a few Rai's (small amount of Nano) to anyone who comments their Nano address, so if you want to try out Nano you can do so with no strings attached.

After 24 hours I'll ALSO send the big prize to a random Redditor who has commented their address, picked (randomly) from this thread. There's currently [125 Nano in there](https://nault.cc/account/nano_1cmgewwzg1eiwroib8btqtcgaw7yox8dsc8kikb8t95anb4qpi6byfibaapk), for a ~$500 pot. For every 100 upvotes this post gets, I'll add in 1 more Nano.

# What is Nano?

Nano is a digital currency/cryptocurrency that offers secure, feeless, instant, and eco-friendly transactions on a secure and decentralized network. [Here is an article on the basics of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-nano-why-its-such-an) and on [Nano's role in the long-term future of crypto](https://senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins). Because it's a global, feeless currency, I can send everyone some, and it will be in your wallet instantly (&lt;1 second).

If you have any questions I'd suggest coming over to [r/nanocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/), since this post will likely get too many replies for me to see your question. **Now post your Nano address and get free Nano!**",CryptoMarkets,Hi Redditors!

Pros:

* Active development team with daily updates
* Proprietary NFT Marketplace just released
* **Currently in First place in Binance Most Valuable Builder, the winner of which get a Binance listing or direct Binance Support.**
* Very early, low market cap that will definitely go up once they win the competition.

Cons:

* New Project. Earnings subject to change.
* Mobile version available but could be more user friendly
* Only on BSC

**Case Study:**

Purchased 12 Characters and a decent sword for $150 (you can start with as little as $5 if you want though) Made $1.81 per character for $21.72 per day or 7-day ROI

# Metal War - 30 Days

Pros:

* PvP and PvE modes with boss and 3D units coming soon
* Great discord and great 'customer service' -&gt; I encountered few bumps on the road and there always was someone to help me.
* Even with a single unit, you can mine shards of expensive units that you can further sell for crypto. So, it's up to you which strategy you want to develop : make an army, make some $$$.

Cons:

* Very expensive entry fee to achieve best ROI (\~$500 currently)
* Still pre-alpha and subject to change
* Repetitive:  you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat.
* Repetitive: you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat (see previous point)

**Case Study:**

Purchased on sale for $500, making $16/day playing the game. Could play more technically but that is all the time I am willing to spend on 1 game especially with lower ROI.

# R-Planet - 60 Days

Pros:

* WAX blockchain space
* No gas, just staking CPU
* Passive income. Buy a rig, make money over time

Cons:

* Price of Aether needs to be stable to earn
* If Whales sell their rigs, it will tank the resale value of the drills, making ROI harder to achieve
* Dated and not updated nearly enough

**Case Study:**

Played since the beginning, rigs are far less profitable now than they were when I bought them. If I purchased an equivalent rig for the current price (\~$1200) I would make \~$20 per day. This is completely passive as well. In my personal opinion, I would not do it at this time until they perform some updates.

# Conclusion

Overall, any of these will continue to grow and I am playing all of them. Not included in CryptoBlades or R-Planet are that you can sell back the NFTs you create on the marketplace for additional Return on Investment. Also with CryptoBlades, the Character NFTs level up as you use them and many of them are going for $100 when they were purchased for $5 just 2 weeks ago.
