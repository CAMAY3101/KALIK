Amongst other things, it will be the basis of our non-custodial staking pools

We will expedite development efforts and for smart contract auditing purposes. The SSV development has already begun alongside key contributors from the Ethereum Foundation and additional industry leaders.

SSV will allow for more secure, decentralized ETH staking by splitting validator signing keys between different parties in a trustless and secure way.

Currently, most of the development efforts are happening in house by the Blox core team. We would like to use this chance to call on more contributors to join in. We are available on Discord and would love to see more people participate in our mission.

&gt; This seemingly simple question is actually more complex. Until February, Binance was considered to be based in Malta.

Binance is a centralized exchange who **answers to no one**. They could exit scam you easily. If you don't think it could happen just take a look at Quadriga. The largest crypto exchange in Canada: http://www.quadrigacx.com/ notice how it's **completely gone** and millions (billions?) of dollars in ETH and BTC wiped out, the owner of the exchange fleeing the country. This happened to an exchange registered in a financially respectable country.

To make Binance **even more sleazy** and to possibly deflect on the fact that they're centralized *and* answer to no one - they copy pasted ethereum and made their own blockchain where they control the validation process and so it's not even decentralized at all. But they gave it a cute name and some pretty UI and are trying to convince people to use it.

* At the time of writing, there are **approximately 7 million Ether locked as collateral in decentralized protocols on the Ethereum network, worth over $9 billion at current prices**.
* We can examine the total daily transaction fees collected on the Ethereum network as a measure of demand, as shown below. Since Ether is the commodity that pays these fees, high fees drive demand for Ether just as an increase in travel might drive demand for gasoline. **Notably, total transaction fees during January 2021 we nearly 5x the peak fees of January 2018.

During the 2017 rally, I have invested a sum of $12K while bitcoin was gaining value like crazy. BTC was around 17K when I invested. I was very new to crypto &amp; it was a mix of fomo &amp; taking advice from people on reddit. Everyone was just so optimistic &amp; posting links to articles like ""BTC to hit 100k this year"" etc. I fell for it.

Couple weeks after my investment, BTC started tanking. Free fall, a total bloodbath. I kept coming back to Reddit for advice but since a lot of people on the BTC / ETHtrader subreddits have money in it, the subreddits were plagued with ""HODL it's coming back up!"" &amp; other nonsense ""TAs"" with funny graphs &amp; impossible predictions.

Needless to say, I decided to HODL like most people were advising while my portfolio sank all the way to 2.5K (I had invested in some shitcoins as well that never recovered - also due to some reddit shills that were selling dreams but that's a story for another day lol...) 

I never sold. Simply re-arranged my portfolio, sold some shitcoins &amp; reinvested in those who were tested &amp; proved. 

BTC has now soared above 50K &amp; it was just enough for me to be in the green again (due to some coins losing 95% of their value &amp; never recovering). Looking back at it, selling during the drop or converting whatever I had to USDT then buying again when the bloodbath was over would have been a much smarter choice &amp; my gains would have been much more substantial.

All of this to say: Don't ""HODL"" blindly. BTC has gained immense value during the recent rally &amp; eventually, it will crash again like it always does. When? No one really knows but sometimes, it's okay to sell so you can lock yourself in a better position after a big dip. Don't follow every optimistic advice because frankly, no one really knows where it's heading next.

Note: I'm only blaming myself for my crypto misadventures. I should've been more careful. I should've researched more &amp; made my own decisions. But one has to make rookie mistakes to learn from them... happy investing!",ethtrader,"Don't fall for every optimistic post on this sub, do your do diligence &amp; make your own decisions."

This is simply not true. In general, after any technology innovation there is a counter force to maintain the status quo. The same thing happened with the internet... and look where we are now. This pessimism is the byproduct of a fear of decentralization and a fear of change. 

Ethereum is the internet of the future. It tends to follow Bitcoin price but it is a completely different animal. Imagine if you could own a part of the internet in 2001 after the dot-com crash...

1612478835,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lcshic/we_all_know_eth_fees_are_high_heres_why_its/,650,4595,"Full disclaimer: I own some ETH. I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

&gt;What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

&gt;Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

&gt;How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

&gt;What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

&gt;What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)",CryptoCurrency,"We all know ETH fees are high. Here's why it's happening, how to save money, and what is being done about it going forward."

Will it negatively implications on the cryptocurrency sector as a whole?

What can we do about it? I guess push for more regulation on these types of things, so that Elon can get even more annoyed by the SEC. Not sure that's a path I'd like to see them go down because it's already quite a grey area.

##**Tether** #27

I don't know who these people really are. They could be bad or good for all I know. But one thing is for certain, these guys are really smart. 

A service where each coin is backed by an actual dollar?  That simply means it can never be worth that much less than a dollar.

They basically figured out how to be an exchange without actually being an exchange.  They just let other exchanges do all the work for them.  They take a really tiny fraction of the fees to use it, and simply reinvest it into a bank, and for each $1 profit put back to the bank creates another tether.  The trading volume is always consistently high.  They will keep growing and growing and growing.
If they are allowed to still operate , and crypto sticks around for another few decades they might eventually take the number one away from BTC at $1ea

I personally believe they started off inflated, gained money fast, and was able to reinvest back in before anyone could audit. But who knows. That's what I like to think. I'm happy that way. üòÜ

Gone for good

##**Bancor** #96

Still around!

##**Metal** #97

##**NavCoin** #98

Gone, but it's legit. Don't count it out for good.

##**Storj**  #99

Gone

Gone
Never owned it and still don't know what the hell it is.

Again when I say gone I simply just mean off the top 100. ;)



**How many are still top 100**?

32, that's less that 1/3

**How many left**?

68 2/3rd

That's how many alts fell off the top 100.

**How many gone for good?**
10 give it take

According to previous bull run data from 2013(pre-ethereum era), 33 out of 37 are gone.  

There's no reason to doubt at least 50 alts we see in the top today won't be in the top 100 in a few years. Doesn't mean they will all die, and many of these older ones are still in the top 200

Just simply means your long term HODLs outside of the top 10 have a 55-60% chance of not working out well for big gains. 

That only makes sense.  

As of now we don't need 1000 Different Cryptos yet.  So you better believe many on top today won't be here another day. What we need privacy, it's our #1 concern really.

We need digital to protect against centralized fractional reserve banking that makes your $1 worth $0.01ea, and of course infinite scalability.

We will always need Altcoins.  BTC is great gold king, and will always be that way I believe.  However, those dam gas fees. Even eth. 

The more adoption we get the more alts will be needed.",CryptoCurrency,2017's BULL RUN: Where did the Top 100 Cryptos Go??

You might‚Äôve seen several posts explaining why keeping your coins in a wallet is the best way to hodl. This is true, if you have a significant amounts of a particular coin because then you will be able to cover the expenses of transfer fees which vary from coin to coin.

But with the rise of newcomers, not everyone can afford to buy large numbers of coins. And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. 

Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don‚Äôt worry about your coins being in danger.

If someone has any other suggestions please let us know.

Edit: Tips from comments:

1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.

2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren‚Äôt fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don‚Äôt want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.

Edit 2: The withdrawal fee which I stated for ETH (0.02) was for the exchange I primarily use which is WazirX.

Presumably in an attempt to smear a local competitor, Hayden Otto inadvertently publishes irrefutable on-chain proof that he excluded non-BCH retail revenue to shape the ""BCH #1 in Australia"" narrative.

## Recap
In September 2019, BitcoinBCH.com started publishing so called monthly ""reports"" about crypto retail payments in Australia. They claimed that **~90% of Australia's crypto retail revenue is processed via their own HULA system** and that **~92% of all crypto retail revenue happens in BCH**.

They are aggregating two data sources to come up with this claim.

One is **TravelByBit (TBB)** who *publishes* their PoS transactions (BTC, LN, ETH, BNB, DASH, BCH) live on a [ticker](https://travelbybit.com/stats).

The other source is **HULA**, a newly introduced POS system (BCH only) and direct competitor to TBB run by BitcoinBCH.com - the same company who created the report. Despite being on-chain their transactions are *private*, not published and not verifiable by third parties outside BitcoinBCH.com

Two things stood out in the ""reports"", noted by multiple users (including vocal BCH proponents):

- **The non-BCH parts must have tx excluded and the report neglects to mention it** (the total in their TBB analysis does not match what is reported on the TBB website.)
- **The BCH part has outliers included** (e.g. BCH city conference in September with 35x the daily average)

The TBB website loads the historic tx data in the browser but hides transactions older than 7 days from being displayed, i.e. you can access more than 7 days worth of data if you understand JavaScript and can read the source code ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4mnfas/)).


## Hayden Otto's reaction

In direct response to me publishing these findings on r/btc, Hayden Otto - an employee at BitcoinBCH.com and the author of the report who also happens to be a moderator of /r/BitcoinCash - banned me immediately from said sub ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dincg5/ucryptostrategies_banned_me_from_rbitcoincash_for/)).

In subsequent discussion (which repeated for every monthly ""report"" which was flawed in the same ways as described above), Hayden responded using the same tactics:

***

**""No data was removed""**

&gt; ""The guy is straight out lying. There is guaranteed no missing tx as the data was collected directly from the source."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds0967/october_report_for_australian_crypto_expenditure/f6nldiy/))

****

**""Only data I considered non-retail was removed""**

&gt; ""I also had these data points and went through them to remove non-retail transactions, on both TravelbyBit and HULA."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3vu2dh/))

He admits to have removed non-BCH tx by ""Game Ranger"" because he considers them non-retail ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8z3ox/)). He also implies they might be involved in money laundering and that TBB might fail their AML obligations in processing Game Ranger's transactions ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/)).

The report does not mention any data being excluded at all and he still fails to explain why several businesses that are clearly retail (e.g. restaurants, cafes, markets) had tx excluded ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f65izlk/)).

****

**""You are too late to prove I altered the data""**

&gt; ""[...] I recorded [the data] manually from https://travelbybit.com/stats/ over the month of September. The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

Fortunately you can, if you can read the website's source code. But you need to know a bit of JavaScript to verify it yourself, so not an ideal method to easily prove the claim of data exclusion to the public. But it laters turns out Hayden himself has found an easier way to achieve the same.

***

**""The report can't be wrong because it has been audited.""**

In response to criticism about the flawed methodology in generating the September report, BitcoinBCH.com hired an accountant from a regional Bitcoin BCH startup to ""audit"" the October report. This is remarkable, because not only did their reported TBB totals still not match those from the TBB site - their result was mathematically impossible. How so? No subset of TBB transaction in that month sums up to the total they reported. So even if they excluded retail transactions at will, they still must have messed up the sum ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ds11om/the_markets_have_yet_to_pricein_bitcoin_cashs/f6mui0q/)). Why didn't their auditor notice their mistake? She said she ""conducted a review based on the TravelByBit data **provided to her**"", i.e. the data acquisition and selection process was **explicitly excluded from the audit** ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/assets/img/blog/october-report/october2019audit.pdf)).

***
**""You are a 'pathetic liar', a 'desperate toll', an 'astroturf account' and 'a total dumb ass' and are 'pulling numbers out of your ass!'""**


Since he has already banned me from the sub he moderates, he started to resort to ad hominems ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dqfcmz/bitcoin_cash_bch_outspent_bitcoin_core_btc_by_a/f68ppam/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8pbgh/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8vclc/), [source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/)).

## Proof of exclusion

I published raw data as extracted from the TBB site after each report for comparison. Hayden responded that I made those numbers up and that I [was pulling numbers out of my ass](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/e7r421/bitcoin_cash_represents_93_of_novembers_crypto/fa8zaca/).

Since he was under the impression that

&gt; ""The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dicdh3/bitcoinbchcoms_bch_is_1_in_australia_report_is/f3wip9j/))

he felt confident to claim that I would be

&gt; unable to provide a source for the [missing] data and/or **prove that that data was not already included in the report**. ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dklkwc/92_of_australias_crypto_retail_volume_is_in_bch/f4j4o6z/))

Luckily for us Hayden Otto seems to dislike his competitor TravelByBit so much that he attempted to reframe Bitcoin's RBF feature as a vulnerability specific to TBB PoS system ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ecdze0/at_this_very_moment_you_can_go_and_double_spend/)).

While doublespending a merchant using the TBB PoS he wanted to prove that the merchant successfully registered the purchase as complete and thus exposed that **the PoS sales history of TBB's merchants are available to the public** ([source](https://youtu.be/lLkiu8zs318?t=329)), in his own words:

&gt; ""You can literally access it from a public URL in the Web browser. There is no login or anything required, just type in the name of the merchant."" ([source](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eeqx9n/australia_travelbybit_crypto_pos_provider_is/fbwd0tn/))

As of yet it is unclear if this is intentional by TBB or if Hayden Ottos followed the rules of responsible disclosure before publishing this kind of data leak.

As it happens, those sale histories do not only include the merchant and time of purchases, they **even include the address the funds were sent to (in case of on-chain payments)**.

This gives us an easy method to prove that the purchases from the TBB website missing in the reports belong to a specific retail business and actually happened - something that is impossible to prove for the alleged HULA txs.

In order to make it easier for you to verify it yourself, we'll focus on a single day in the dataset, **September 17th, 2019** as an example:

- Hayden Otto's report claims **20 tx and $713.00** in total for that day ([source](https://bitcoinbch.com/blog/Australian-Cryptocurrency-Expenditure-at-Retail-Businesses.html))
- The TBB website listed **40 tx and a total of $1032.90** ([daily summary](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/dibzek/crypto_payments_not_adding_up_for_australia_and/f3x07i2/))
- Pick a merchant, e.g. ""The Stand Desserts""
- Use Hayden's ""trick"" to access that merchants public sale history at https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/merchanthistory/thestanddesserts, sort by date to find the 17th Sep 2019 and look for a transaction at 20:58 for $28. This proves that a purchase of said amount is associated with this specific retail business.
- Paste the associated crypto on-chain address  `17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9` in a blockchain explorer of your choice, e.g like [this](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9). This proves that a transfer of funds has actually happened.

I let software aggregate the TBB statistics with the public sale histories and you'll find at the bottom of this post a table with the on-chain addresses conveniently linked to blockchain explorers for our example date.

The total of **all 40 tx is $1032.90** instead of the $713.00 reported by Hayden. 17 tx of those have a corresponding on-chain address and thus have undeniable proof of $758.10. Of the remaining 23, 22 are on Lightning and one had no merchant history available.

This is just for a single day, here is a comparison for the whole month.

| Description | Total |
| - | - |
| TBB Total | $10,502|
| TBB wo. Game Ranger|$5,407|
| TBB according to Hayden|$3,737|

## What now?

The usual shills will respond in a predictive manner: The data must be fake even though its proof is on-chain, I would need to provide more data but HULA can be trusted without any proof, if you include outliers BCH comes out ahead, yada, yada.

But this is not important. I am not here to convince them and this post doesn't aim to.

The tx numbers we are talking about are less than 0.005% of Bitcoin's global volume. If you can increase adoption in your area by 100% by just buying 2 coffees more per day you get a rough idea about how irrelevant the numbers are in comparison.

What is relevant though and what this post aims to highlight is that BitcoinBCH.com and the media outlets around news.bitcoin.com flooding you with the BCH #1 narrative are playing dirty. They feel justified because they feel that Bitcoin/Core/Blockstream is playing dirty as well. I am not here to judge that but you as a reader of this sub should be aware that this is happening and that you are the target.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes $1,000 Bitcoin tx because of high value but includes $15,000 BCH tx because they are made by ""professionals"", you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes game developers, travel businesses or craftsmen accepting Bitcoin because they don't have a physical store but include a lawyer practice accepting BCH, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com excludes restaurants, bars and supermarkets accepting Bitcoin and when pressed reiterate that they excluded **non-retail** businesses without ever explaning why a restaurant shouldn't be considered reatil, you should be sceptical.

When BitcoinBCH.com claims the reports have been audited but omit that the data acquisition was not part of the audit, you should be sceptical.

I expect that BitcoinBCH.com will stop removing transactions from TBB for their reports now that it has been shown that their exclusion can be provably uncovered. I also expect that HULA's BCH numbers will rise accordingly to maintain a similar difference.

Hayden Otto assumed that nobody could cross-check the TBB data. He was wrong. Nobody will be able to disprove his claims when HULA's BCH numbers rise as he continues to refuse their release. You should treat his claims accordingly.

As usual, do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Sorry for the long read.

## TLDR

- BitcoinBCH.com claimed no transactions were removed from the TBB dataset in their BCH #1 reports and that is impossible to prove the opposite.
- Hayden Otto's reveals in a double spend attempt that a TBB merchant's sale history can be accessed publicly including the merchant's on-chain addresses.
- This table shows 40 tx listed on the TBB site on sep 17th, including their on-chain addresses where applicable.
- The BitcoinBCH.com report lists only 20 tx for the same day.

Both of these individuals possess a strong understanding of the regulatory landscape and the crypto ecosystem. Coinbase is extremely selective with new project listings.

They understand it represents crypto‚Äôs best shot at a decentralized stablecoin.

As Coinbase continues to smartly position itself as an important and regulated hub of all things crypto, it also brings with it credence among the crypto space (including MKR). Thus far, DAI has been easy to access. On the other hand, the governance token MKR has been far more challenging to acquire due to liquidity issues and technological complexities.

For Maker to succeed, it **needs more stakeholders**. This listing will bring **more governance participation, more proposals for collateral, and a diverse set of opinions**. This listing not only brings greater liquidity and access for developers to participate in the success of the project but will also **contribute further to the resilience of Maker.** This increased interest will further solidify its position as the king of DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

Ill start by saying I don't **hate** Doge, honestly I **love** Doge, this coin had a purpose to become a great meme and he fulfilled it successfully.

&amp;#x200B;

But I would **never never** think about investing hefty amounts of **money** in **doge**, its a shame that **doge** was a targeted by that **pump and dump** groups and got to the state he is in today.

seems like Many people mistake Meme coins purpose and think their only use is to **Pump and Dump.**

**that not** entirely true, I Believe memes coins are great way to have fun with it and introduce newcomers with funny coins that don't really worth that much just to show them the way of crypto.

Let's take a look at another Meme coincalled ""Banano"" :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4lqtlub43ue61.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f34e259af7ec3314e43cc3cc2ddb18579760ac24

&amp;#x200B;

It's a simple meme coin that you can get in a Couple of ways :

1. participating in Banano reddit or Discord and get tipped or win a giveaway.
2.  Folding@Home-  By folding at home you can ""Mine"" Banano by renting your GPU and CPU power to True Medical Research.

with a low value of each Banano coin you can truly have fun with it by accumulating some , giving away some or contribution to Medical Research,

 and that's the purpose of a Meme coin **in my opinion- Having fun.**

People should understand that Investing Hefty amounts of money in meme coins isn't a wise choice!

but people can do whatever they want, if you decide to invest in something you should DYOR and take full responsibilities of the outcome.

# Fight against the Pump and Dump Groups

# 

Back to our Topic, Don't Hate the Coins that are being Pumped and Dumped, most of them probably being victimized by Pump and Dump groups.

**Hate The Pump and Dump groups**, because these groups can move from Coin to Coin every single day and create chaos that isn't even connected to a certain coin.

For example many people in this sub like LTO, Fantom or more low Marketcap coins, heck this Pump and Dump groups are now targeting XRP so its not just Low Market Cap coins, lets think about XLM, Ada, VET and more.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you react if a Pump and Dump groups will decide to pump of your favorite coin?

Would you turn your anger towards the Developers or the managers of that coin? 

You Should turn that anger to that Pump and Dump groups that will bring chaos to a legit coin.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm asking you one thing don't turn your hate towards a certain coin, turn your anger against these groups, don't Join them, Downvotes their posts, report them to the admins and try to prevent people from joining these groups.

# Only together we can stop it!

I've been reading success stories about cryptocurrency for a few years now, and I always thought it was never meant for me because I'm not the kind of guy that has a few thousand dollars to spare on a gamble. But browsing this sub for a while, I learned that you don't need a few thousand dollars to get started. 

A few weeks ago, a good friend of mine gave me a tip on a fairly new alt coin that looks promising, and I have just doubled my small investment so far. I would have never gotten into it if it hadn't been for this sub.

Seeing all these ""only invest what you can afford"" advices gave me the push I needed. Until then, I thought crypto was meant for already fairly rich people who only want to get even more rich. 

I'm not one of those people. I'm a 31 year old single guy who makes a decent amount of money, but I can't apply for the mortgage I want because the bank thinks it's too much of a risk for a single income household.

I have savings. Enough to pay for the costs that go with buying property, not enough for the bank to trust me.

I don't need a fancy Lamborghini or an indoor swimming pool. I just want to buy my own place. If a crypto profit of a few thousand bucks gets me there, that would be nice.

If I lose my investment, so be it. At least I've tried. 

So again, thank all of you for unknowingly giving this stranger the push he needed towards being a little more comfortable financially.

1614241420,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ls1s0b/i_wanted_to_share_my_personal_crypto_story_from/,98,75,"I'm not a native speaker so be easy on me writing my story :). Anyway I'd love to share my story to you experienced or new crypto investors and fellow redditors!

My story started around September 2017. I was in my 2nd year of college and starting to learn a bit about the stock market etcetera. A guy I met that year who later became a good friend told me about crypto and how it might be interesting. We were talking about bitcoin (obviously) and after some small digging I decided to buy bitcoin on an investment app. Turned out this wasn't the ""real"" bitcoin but Just a derivative of it's price. I had leverage on it and when it went down after my buy the position closed and I lost all the money. At that point BTC was sitting around 3.000 I believe.

Later that year, around October or November the same friend explained to me how to invest in real currencies and so I opened an account on Bittrex. He had Verge coin and told me I could buy that as well so I put a small position in that one. 

Around that same time I believe I joined Reddit and also this subreddit simultaneously. I came to know about other coins and projects such as Nano, NEO, Ethereum and others. I also kinda learned how Blockchain worked and I thought it was really interesting so I bought some more into Ethereum and the other coins. What I did was, and this is very important in my opinion, buy with money that I just accepted I lost. At that point my portfolio with the small verge position started surging. I didn't expect it to go so fast but it did. Like I read from a similar post the guy explained very well. The coins went x2, then another x2 and another and sometimes more. My verge position was multiplied by 18x and it was insane. I somehow sold verge at it's all time high and sold it for Ethereum which I still think was my best call at that time.

The other alts pumped as well and my portfolio went from a really tiny investment in something that became more and more serious. I totally admit this made me greedy as fuckü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. When you see your portfolio doubling, and a week after it doubles again you start to think: damn this could get serious. Around Christmas it was madness. Bitcoin surged from around 13k to 20k in a matter of days, Ethereum and the alts boomed a few days or weeks after when Bitcoin was stable. Coins where coming out of nowhere and everything went x6 or x8 even. This made me stress out whether to keep the coins on an exchange, sell them or cold store them. I chose the latter.

At some point you started seeing some small dips in the market, some bigger and then up again. My portfolio had reached an all time high at that point and I didn't know it back then. When you see 10% drops you think: aah this'll go up again, no worries. Then it drops 20% and you tell yourself: I won't sell at these prices, it was higher before. It kept going down with some waves of up movement but the trend was definitely going down. Like I said before I considered the money I invested gone so luckily for me there weren't too many emotions involved. 

Still at one point around October after 2018 summer my portfolio was down 93% and I was bag holding coins like REQ, ICX, NANO etc. Those took some hard beatings. When this happens you kinda become numb to it. You regret not selling but you also know it's impossible to time your positions. I also went to an event in my town which explained Blockchain and it's use case very well. I thought this was very cool!

Fast forward in 2019 I went to live in another country for my study. I still remember Bitcoin kinda coming back to life at one point and I noticed myself checking it more often again. I believe it even went to 12K and then back again. Sadly when bitcoin pumps alts don't directly go with it and when bitcoin dumps alts dump more. The more this happened the worse alts got beaten up. I never bought bitcoin because I didn't believe in it's user case. I saw it like a big old dinosaur which would go extinct. Still regret that now, hindsight sigh.

Anyway fast forward again and we reached the corona pandemic which made the market tank hugely again. Bitcoin sitting around 3k before going up again. I regret it but I never really added to my position because in times like that you really think: this is too risky, it might never go up again. 

Since the corona pandemic I had more time and I checked the subreddit and my portfolio more often. I even logged into my exchange account again which I didn't do in 2 years. Lots of things going on as everything started climbing again. As I logged in I noticed my coins I was bag holding. I converted them all to Ethereum which was sitting at 540 at that time. Not a bad thing looking back now.

Now we're here today and I personally still haven't reached that 2017 all time high. It's just because I bought into some altcoins around their all time high and they never really recovered again. Also because I never dollar cost averaged on my 2017-2018 position. 

These few years have definitely taught me a lot though. My lessons I've learned are:

 ‚Ä¢ Don't invest more than you are willing to lose

 ‚Ä¢ Consider the money gone to prevent emotional actions or trading.

 ‚Ä¢ Hold on to your positions or make slight adjustments if you see fit.

-Do your own research at coins you're eyeballing (common advice here).

 ‚Ä¢ Don't panic sell.

 ‚Ä¢ DCA (dollar cost average) when possible. Don't invest everything at once. 

 ‚Ä¢ Spread risk into multiple projects consider a portion into more stable projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum

 ‚Ä¢ HODL.

-Buy the dip (not like me who didn't do that hahaha)

Anyway if you made it this far, thanks a lot! I hope you enjoyed my tiny story of crypto investment.

It is quite obvious and this time too the trend is downward. Moons given out per karma is decreasing faster over time. There's almost a 40% decrease relative to round 9.

# Number of Vaults :

1612464013,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lcmlku/you_are_new_into_crypto_and_wanna_make_money_well/,61,149,"For a lot of people on here much of this will be common sense, but here's a reminder from someone who suffered 2018's crash:

**1. Do not listen to anyone. Always be skeptical of opinions, no matter how credible or famous the person or organization making the claim.**

Some of us want to take the easy way by finding someone hyping a coin on the internet. If you are trying to find the next big coin, and are basing your investment based on other people's opinions; you will likely not succeed. You have to go out and seek your own investments based on your own research. If you go on YouTube, and seek some dude hyping some coin and invest with no facts in your arsenal, you will likely fail. If you invest in a coin because it is popular at the moment, and jump on the hype wagon you will fail. Hyped coins are already likely at a top. It will correct itself, and you may panic sell. If you sell because of negative speculation, you may likely fail. The only thing you should believe are facts. If China, or another country actually bans bitcoin, that is a fact. If Wall Street Journal, Glodman Sachs, or Charlie Lee posts an opinion that bitcoin to fiat exchanges will be banned with no proof, that is an opinion.

**2. Your portfolio value will crash (eventually), but that is okay.**

When times are good, everyone feels like they are a genius. If your coin tripled in a month, you may feel like you are a genius. But do not forget the fact that what comes up must go down. What goes down, has great potential to eventually come back much stronger. This does not go for all investments, only the ones that have real value. If your investment sucks, then it will only go down.

**3. Do not forget the fact that you are playing a game of high risk, high reward**.

Cryptocurrencies in its current form are VERY volatile. Do not expect to win forever, or lose forever. Some days you will cry, others you will hysterically laugh at your success. However, just because your dad or friend claims crypto currencies are too unstable, a Joke or whatever; do not trust their word. You likely have much more knowledge about crypto than them, or even the CEO of Goldman Sachs or whatever. (I may be wrong but that is my opinion).

**4. It is possible that regulation will screw cryptocurrencies forever.**

Just because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, does not mean countries cannot ban it. If countries do ban it, cryptocurrencies will obviously become much more useless. What are most owners of bitcoin to do with illegal bitcoin? If central banks do not like blockchain, they certainly have the power to do severe harm. They do have the power to influence elections, businesses, entire markets, or even buy up our entire marketcap if they so desire. It is scary for us to think about in terms of the harm governments and central banks can pose to our very precious crypto.

Edit: I'll add /u/TheAgGames's opinion because I find it very valuable:

&gt;When it comes to banning crypto, I dont see that happening with major players getting in on the action like visa and paypal. The worse is itll be highly regulated and be treated like a volatile stock market. 

And last, but not least important...

For example, I know many of my beginner friends who think coins under $5 are a great deal, because ""they might go to 10k like bitcoin"".

That is obviously impossible, because most of these coins are centralized, owned 60%+ by the founders, and because these coins have 1,000,000,000+ supply. They'll never go to to $10k, let alone $100. They're actually already ridiculously overpriced, having made their creators ""paper billionaires"" even though their ""cryptocurrency"" has basically 0 users.

Coin listing sites are also hiding the real supply by allowing unlocked coins to be ""out of circulation"" even though there's nothing technically or legally keeping them out of circulation. They are IN circulation by any legal or technical definition.

Yet beginners think these altcoin founders will be soon worth ""trillions of paper $"", because exchanges and coin ranking sites are misleading them.

About a week ago, I decided to stop relying on the Foundation of the coin to try and get the swap done and handle it on my own, only to be met with total ignorance and incoherence in Huobi support.

They're practicing limited supply trading on the coins. This means that they close off deposits/withdraws but keep trading open. Trading then happens only on a limited supply (which they likely own 95%+ themselves) and are able to manipulate the price however they wish. Huobi are currently doing this to a handful coins, and have a history of doing it over and over again. It doesn't seem like they plan to stop.

This isn't your ordinary hard-fork attempt at keeping ASICs away. It is a characteristically unique innovation, where modern CPUs *are* the ASICs for RandomX. 

It accomplishes this by utilizing the full resources of a modern CPU:  Virtual machines, out-of-order operations, floating-point (decimal) math, branch prediction, large on-chip memory, and large RAM, among others. These are physical on-chip units which make modern processors versatile and ""smart,"" so to speak.  

By comparison, normal hashing is a very simple algorithm, easily printed directly to a circuit board (ASICs). If you wanted to design an ASIC for RandomX, you would basically be re-inventing a modern CPU. Again, this is characteristically unique approach, not just a tweak. 

Most people will reasonably be able to mine with their laptop or home computer. You won't get rich mining RandomX, but you will be able to earn a small amount of Monero over time.

Well I thought that knowing what a coin or it's dev team has on their roadmap for future can be a useful piece of information in making decisions about investment. Some coins/tokens really aren't having any future updates so their current/most recent update is therefore listed.

The ""Top 20"" is from coinmarketcap rankings. I am not trying to make a statement that top 20 mean the 20 greatest or my perspective. These were the top 20 at the time of posting on coinmarketcap. I also suggest you to consider this a concise/one line version describing the upgrade. For more details, I recommend you look up the internet based on the information below.

# Top 20 CryptoCurrencies and their upcoming/recent updates:

1. **Bitcoin (BTC) :** Bitcoin network is expected to have the ""Schnorr signatures"". This solves some issues with privacy and scalability. This upgrade if passed, is expected to lower bitcoin transaction fee and also improve privacy of the holders. It also paves the way forward for Lightning network and Coinswaps.
2. **Ethereum (ETH) :** The EIP-1559 is the next intended upgrade to the ETH network. It revamps the GAS payment methods. Instead of auction type GAS payments, it introduces BASEFEE methods. It is expected to make GAS fees ""predictable"" but might not have a great effect on reducing the fee. It also introduces a deflation to ETH tokenomics as BASEFEE paid is burnt. And of course ETH 2.0 too but it's bigger to discuss here.
3. **Cardano (ADA) :** Cardano currently launched the mary update to allow multi assests on the cardano network. It is part of the ""Gougen"" era of cardano, which plans to introduce smart contracts and DeFi just like ETH to ADA network and unlike ERC-20 standard, cardano is trying to implement native ledgers for these multi asset tokens.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB) :** BNB is the native token of the Binance Smart Chain(BSC). Currently, the news/update is that new DeFi platforms like existing PancakeSwap are being developed on it and also 1Inch has extended support on BSC. Little is known about any distant updates as only source for news is either CZ or Binance themselves.
5. **Tether (USDT) :** Tether recently settled their lawsuit about the ""lie"" of having a stable token with backed assets. They are going to pay $18.5 Million in penalties. 
6. **Polkadot (DOT) :** Parachains, the building blocks of the polkadot network are currently in the ""rococo"" phase and parachains are on test networks. Once they are tested, they'll be rolled onto the kusama network which helps devs see real network effects which aren't available on general testnets. When they pass on kusama too, we'll see first good parachains launch on DOT network via governance.
7. **Ripple (XRP) :** Ripple is still fighting with the SEC regarding the ""unregistered security"" case and many exchanges have an approach of wait till it settles and make a move. Co ordinated buying attacks have happened . Although SEC has strong evidence, it is being viewed as an overkill attempt to regulate crypto and is believed to just be FUD. You figure what is what...
8. **Chainlink (LINK) :** Chainlink has launched OCR ""Off chain reporting"" to their mainnet. What it does is it increases the amount of data oracles on network can bring on chain to 10x and 90% reduction in on chain costs according to Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov. More data output means more data can be brought on chain by DeFi which means more innovation on network.
9. **Litecoin (LTC) :** Litecoin is getting closer to launch it's MimbleWimble upgrade. It brings the feature of ""opt-in"" privacy to transactions and increases scalability. The date of launch is believed to be at around March 15. 
10. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH) :** Bitcoin Cash will undergo an upgrade at around May 15th. I am not familiar with BCH and I was unable to find any official source on what the upgrade will be except from discussion and personal views. I'd be happy if anyone suggested an edit here.
11. **Stellar (XLM) :** After announcing samsung intergration in july, the crypto exchange and finance firm Abra announced that they'll be introducing traditional finance like banking to people without crypto knowledge on the XLM Blockchain. And Ripple battling SEC, XLM is expected to see adoption as both XRP and XLM initally wanted to serve the payments segment of crypto.
12. **USD Coin (USDC) :** After launching USDC on the Stellar network, the Floating Point Group (FPG) now is bringing USDC onto the Algorand network as USDCa. It aims to streamline and increase the capital efficiency for institutions compared to conventional transfer.
13. **UniSwap (UNI) :**  The DEX Uniswap is expected to have an upgrade to UniSwap v3. The tokens swaps in native forms are raising gas prices. An L2 solution is expected which is rumoured to be zk-Rollups that take the work off chain. Liquidity mining is also expected to have new farms and also a better UX for users.
14. **NEM (XEM) :** On March 15, NEM will transition from N1S1 to Symbol. Symbol is described as a ‚Äútrusted, secure value exchange network for business. Symbol smooths business friction, increasing the flow of data and innovation to supercharge the creation, exchange and protection of assets.
15. **Dogecoin (DOGE) :** Dogecoin recently had a recent core upgrade 1.14.3. It made significant improvements to the speed at which a node can upload blocks will be made by removing expensive integrity checks which were previously carried out each time a block was sent to another node after the update is applied.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) :** It is a wrapped version of BTC on ERC20 and I wasn't able to find any upgrades. I would be happy if someone suggested an edit here.
17. **Aave (AAVE) :** Aave and Balancer recently announced their partnership. under the partnership a part of each liquidity pool on Balancer will become available to deposit on Aave, where it will facilitate lending. This process will be controlled by Balancer‚Äôs asset manager, which automatically supplies tokens to Aave when they are not needed in the pool.
18. **Cosmos (ATOM) :** Cosmos recently upgraded to Stargate. Stargate represents an important milestone for the Cosmos project on the way to launching its inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol that will allow the 200+ Tendermint-based blockchains to interoperate easily. It also brings some features, the chain will run more efficiently, upgrades will be much faster and full nodes will be able to sync up more quickly.
19. **Monero (XMR) :** The Monero devs are working on making Monero more easier to use. The current most awaited feature in XMR space are the atomic swaps. Atomic swaps allow users to swap between BTC and XMR smoothly on a single DEX. This might not sound incredible, but it is. As exchanges crackdown on monero trading...it's difficult for people to buy and sell XMR. With atomic swaps, they can in future just convert from XMR to BTC and trade.
20. **Solana (SOL) :** Raydium, the first AMM(Automated market maker) on Solana Blockchain was launched on Feb 22. The release of Raydium helps to bring the SOL ecosystem one step closer to being a viable competitor for DeFi on Ethereum.",CryptoCurrency,Top 20 CryptoCurrencies and their upcoming/recent updates

Proponents of decentralization aren't happy that CZ and Binance dishonestly promote their network as decentralized and 'DeFi', with a number of rumors about just how many of BSC's 21 nodes are operated by Binance (some say 11, others have said all 21, some say just a few). 

After CZ has started bashing Ethereum and artificially infalted ETH gas fees by making all withdrawals pay 10-30% more than ETH gas station's 'highest' rate, it appears that proponents of decentralization have struck back.

They've launched a DeFi/farming app on BSC about the Tiananmen Square massacre, presumably to force CZ to remove it and end BSC's charade as a 'decentralized' blockchain.

Here is the smart contract address: https://bscscan.com/token/0xb79c9c73e8c7b4be7244e697e6bdb9f511208e9c

The ""Gate-keeper"" usually responds with something snark or less than welcoming to the person who asks the question, possibly following it up with, ""You probably shouldn't be in crypto if you don't know what that is."" or ""How does someone with 2000 USD of crypto not know what this is?""               

I hate to say it guys, but every time we make remarks like this to newcomers and novices, we are arguably pushing back the goalpost for mass-adoption.

EDIT:  To add to this I would like to also inform you all that I had a coworker at a centralised exchange who legitimately believed that the US dollar was backed by gold until myself and some coworkers corrected him.  He was a software programmer. And finally, if you asked most people in your country about what the fabric composition of fiat currency being used is, most people couldn't answer you.  If you ask them any other perfectly innocuous questions about the currency in their hands then they likely couldn't answer you either.

In my opinion, it's important to be aware of it so you can form your own opinion for your investments and help spur discussion.

[Link to the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lp9i8n/the_fud_for_every_top_10_coin_and_why_you_should/)

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin** \- Although the pioneer of blockchain technology, it is considered slow, expensive, and unscalable compared to many emerging coins over the past 10 years (LTC, BCH, XLM, NANO, etc..) It's also much easier for you (depending on the country you live in) to send money to a friend or spend your currency at a store with credit cards or apps like Venmo/PayPal. At this point, many question why use bitcoin when they can just use their own currency reflecting how many don't perceive or care about the importance of decentralization. Another major piece of FUD is which country controls most of the bitcoin as it seems China and USA have a dominant control over mining operations which makes many believe that there is nothing stopping one country from attacking the network. Bitcoin also has some other FUD like how it's not a physical asset like gold, whales manipulating the price, what happens if I lose my keys, etc... but many of those arguments can be applied to other crypto and blockchain technology so I won't focus on them here. Forgot to mention, but also energy costs related to mining.
2. **Ethereum** \- It's no surprise that the major FUD against Ethereum is scalability. There are many platforms on the rise trying to take the spotlight from Ethereum and become a highly scalable and decentralized platform that provides cheap and fast fees for using its applications. Many believe the rise of ADA, DOT, and BNB are mainly because of Ethereum's scaling issues. There is alot riding on ethereum 2 to solve its scaling issues but still seems to be at least a year out before it transitions. Ethereum also has some FUD surrounding its distribution of coins and concerns of whales holding much of the supply but it seems to not have much of the focus right now.
3. **Binance Coin** \- The main argument against BNB is that its primarily centralized and doesn't have value other than being used to reduce fees when trading on Binance. With one company controlling the tokenomics and its future, it goes against what many believe to be the core tenet of blockchain which is decentralization.
4. **Tether** \- Although its a stablecoin, Tether has possibly the biggest FUD even when compared to bitcoin because of its lack of auditing and what many believe to be ""fake"" money propping up the price of bitcoin. If tether is ever found out to be artificially pumping Bitcoin with fake reserves, it would make the value of Bitcoin artificial and cause a large crash.
5. **Polkadot** \- The rise of DOT so fast into the top 10 this year has made many question its value. DOT had a large token sale in the past couple of years before it's release on exchanges which helped drive its price but makes some fearful of how much early investors control the supply before retail could buy in. Seen as a competitor to Ethereum, DOT is attempting an ecosystem of applications but has yet to prove itself when compared to the number of developers and transactions on Ethereum. There are also concerns regarding DOT's allocation of funding to developers in that there is a large amount of funding being aggressively driven to developers to create apps. There is also some FUD regarding its creator and a fictional story involving a minor he made in the past but I'll let you google that.
6. **Cardano** \- Another competitor to Ethereum is ADA which some believe to be a ""ghostchain"". With a long roadmap ahead and many items to deliver, Cardano doesn't have near the amount of transactions or applications compared to Ethereum but promises to be the 3rd generation of crypto platforms ahead of Ethereum. There are also concerns over how much the network is decentralized but that doesn't seem to be the main focus of FUD right now. Much like DOT, ADA is a wait and see.
7. **XRP** \- Many consider XRP to be what blockchain shouldn't be about and that is working with banks and other payment providers to facilitate transactions. With its focus on becoming the choice of crypto for banks and an all in one payment solution, many see it as a zero sum game considering bitcoin's value is about P2P transactions and being decentralized and free of the third party involvement. Ripple has also come under fire recently after being sued by the SEC for misallocation of funding relating to not registering as a securities offering.
8. **Litecoin** \- Seen as a clone of bitcoin with some minor changes to make it faster and cheaper, LTC's value seems to only be derived from bitcoin's value although that makes many question why they should invest in LTC when BTC exists. LTC's value also competes with other coins that are considered faster, cheaper, and more scalable. There is active development but some think it's small compared to other projects and some consider that the creater of the project, Charlie Lee, abandoned the project after selling his coins in 2017.
9. **Chainlink** \- Seen as an important piece of the Ethereum ecosystem to connect applications and data because of oracles, the major FUD against the project seems to be control of its supply by whales. Many may also not understand why Chainlink needs a token and its inherent value, as oracles can be a confusing topic if you're not already a crypto developer.
10. **Bitcoin Cash** \- This project has caused a lot of controversy as it was hard forked from bitcoin in 2017. It has attempted to solve bitcoin's scaling problem and become faster and cheaper but many believe it was done as a cash grab by the BCH developers to have a similar name to bitcoin and ride the hype of bitcoin. It also caused some other hard forks to occur like Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Gold to cause even more confusion.
11. **XLM -** Stellar was made by Ripple's co-founder in 2014, sharing similar technology.  Both prices have been correlated to each other since then, so when Ripple was hit by a SEC filing in 2020, XLM alongside with XRP dropped hard. It has seen slower development than Ripple. Stellar is more appraised than Ripple due to being decentralized but both cater to banks and other financial institutions, which FUD is explained in XRP.
12. **UNI -** UNI is the largest ERC20 token by market cap, one that exists within Ethereum's blockchain. People were awarded these as airdrops for using Uniswap, a DEX. But because it came from Uniswap, there's some FUD about the coin which shed from the exchange. Uniswap has suffered several exploits involving minor tokens, $300,000 to $1 million of imBTC was stolen in April 2020, and $370,000 worth of Opyn tokens were stolen in August 2020. It's also been criticized for not being as transparent for decentralization. Being ERC20, it suffers the same scalability issues that ETH has, like high fees.
13. **DOGE -** A meme coin created in Dec. 6, 2013 forked from LTC by a person called Shibetoshi who created it in 1 day. It was never meant to be a store of value. It has an infinitely increasing supply of 10,000 coins per block at a rate of roughly 1 block per minute. Elon Musk hard shilling it on Twitter with several subreddits made it seem like a big PnD scheme.
14. **WBTC -** The ERC20 token for bitcoin, close to 1:1. Being ERC20, it suffers the same scalability issues that ETH has, like high fees. There's also controversies about tokenized BTC being that you're not owning actual BTC, just the representation of it.
15. **XEM -** An established crypto in Asia, many are skeptical due to its high centralization. Its blockchain is considered obsolete as others like Ethereum or Cardano can do better. Lack of development funding had led to a reorganization of their team.
16. **OKB -** Like BNB, OKB is centralized and used to reduce fees in the OKEX exchange. OKEX has much controversy, like suspending all cryptocurrency withdraws in 2020.
17. **HT -** Like OKB and BNB. Huobi, a Chinese CEX, has been shrouded with FUD as controlled by the Chinese government, i.e. conforming to the ban of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and trading on domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017.
18. **ATOM -** A token used as gas for a project named Cosmos, with goals similar to DOT and ETH, but there is some uncertainty to the success of the Cosmos project due to its lack of widespread support.
19. **AAVE -** Many were skeptical about its sudden rise in price this year. As an ERC20 token, it has scalability issues.
20. **Monero -** As a privacy coin, it's used extensively in dark net markets. This led to CEXs seeing it as controversial, and a Bittrex delisting in the start of 2021, causing a noticeable plummet in price.

The fundamental reason to stay away from doge is very clear cut, it has an unlimited supply!  Not enough people are mentioning this to all the folks jumping on the bandwagon.

With coins that have an unlimited supply, your piece will always be shrinking unless your constantly buying more.  You can outrun the treadmill sure, but why waste your energy like that.

However, I am not a financial advisor, and this is based solely on my own reading and what I think seems to be some kind of consensus.

I hope this can be a civil discussion without the need for tribalism.

At that time DWave had a 7 or 9 qubit QC.

QC can break private keys. They do this by solving a math problem, product of primes. Example:

3 \* 5 = 15  
3 and 5 are prime numbers. 15 is the product.  
You can see 15 as a ""public key"". 3 and 5 as ""private keys"".

A QC can, in theory, ""test"" all numbers and find the prime numbers (5 and 3) just by giving the product of the primes (15).

But there is a **huge catch**

  
""In the published article, Google explains how the 53 qubit internally  developed quantum computer ‚Äì Sycamore ‚Äì was able to perform a  calculation in just 200 seconds. Their benchmarks suggest that this  would have taken a classic supercomputer around 10,000 years to carry  out the same calculation.""

53 qubit is still many orders of magnitude lower than any real application encryption.

I want to point out 53 qubit do **not** reduce the security of bigger encryption algorithms. A 54 bit encryption is **not** going to be break in **X interations** of the 53 qubit. In other words, to break a 54 bit encryption you need a 54 qubit.

To break RSA 1024 you need a 1024 qubit quantum computer which is still pretty difficult to built.

And at this point you **cannot** just add/chain quantum computers together to form a bigger QCs.

I am guessing we are 15 years from a 512 qubit and 25 years from a 2048 qubit

Some biases to be aware of:

-these are the top comments of all time so perhaps not a fair representation

-I ensured isolated mentions of the ticker or full crypto name (e.g. 'BTC' or 'bitcoin'), with punctation or spaces before and after each time it's mentioned, but surely people use LINK not always to mean the chainlink ticker, so it is perhaps over-represented

As of writing this doge has a 127910836383.00... circulating supply. 

So to quote an edge lords post I just saw on the cesspool called r/dogecoin ‚Äùif everyone on this sub all buys 50 dollars worth of doge and hold that will be a BILLION DOGE!!!!1!!1!‚Äù

Cute, love your enthusiasm, really I do....here's the problem.

1 billion doge is .781% of circulating supply. If you were buying a coin that had a finite supply then yeah, that would actually be pretty dang powerful.....but you're not.

You're buying a coin that inflates 5% annually what that means is the all you drooling fuckwits ""diamond handzz üíéü§≤üíéü§≤üíéü§≤üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"" will watch 6.5 times as many coins be mined and dumped within one year, it takes less than 2 months to mine a billion doge, and those of us mining it for fun to keep this great learning tool alive have no problem dumping and teaching you to spend 20 minutes researching before you listen to Reddit on what to throw your money at.


Have people made money off the doge pump? Totally. Will people make more? Totally. 

But here's your problem, you aren't fighting boomers who are to fucking brain dead to open a PDF file, that also happen to be the closest thing we have to super villians who destroy markets and lives for their own profit.

Nope, you're challenging 20 and 30 something year olds that were born with a mouse in their palm, your challenging people who not only know crypto, but fucking built it, not living off daddies trust fund and connections for generations. There's no 2nd generation of privilege in crypto like wallstreet, welcome to the bleeding fucking edge.


I have a bag of doge, I send it to friends that say ""hey so how do I get started in this crypto thingy"" I sent doge to my dad so he could play with a wallet and understand the concept.

If my dad burned the 1000 doge I sent him, we would laugh because it's worthless and that's what it's for, learning how to use crypto. 

When you send Bitcoin to the wrong address and burn it, it's gone. The total supply of Bitcoin has permanently been decreased. And that's why people call it digital gold, there's only so much to go around, after it's all been mined it's over, miners will only get paid in transaction fees. 

This is not financial advice. This is common fucking sense. Spend 20 minutes and read about what crypto you're going to put money in to. Doge coin inflates more than Fiat, and it does so for the exact purpose of preventing this kind of shit. Even one of the co creators has a less than 50 dollar bag of doge because anything more than literal beer money is stupid to invest in something built to inflate.

He said he saw it went up over 500% but it was still sitting at only $0.06 a coin (down to $0.04 now). He asked me if I thought it was worth buying a bunch of dogecoin because, and I quote, ""it wouldn't take much to drive it from $0.06 up to $0.12"". 

There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of how market cap actually work in cryptocurrencies. The equation is very simple! Number of coins in circulation multiplied by price per coin. 

The problem comes into play when you compare how many coins will be in circulation with a given crypto. With Bitcoin, you will have a total of 21 million coins in circulation when they are fully mined. With Litecoin, you will have a total of 84 million coins currently in circulation when full mined. So when you look at the total of these coins, you see that Litecoin has 4x the max coins that will be in circulation. So when you account this for price, you would have to compare 1 Bitcoin to 4 Litecoin to get a comparity value in price when looking for market cap.

Now turning back to doge, they have a current supply of a 128 billion coins with a never ending supply. I have seen some discussion of adding a hard cap, but haven't read anything concrete yet. So using the current circulation at 128 billion coins at the now $0.04 a piece, this places the market cap at over $5 billion. For doge to reach $0.12, you would now need to triple that $5 billion. So to say that dogecoin could go from $0.04 to $0.12 is easy because it's only an $0.08 difference. To say $5 billion to $15 billion is a lot harder. 

As a side note, don't forget one of the major advantage that cryptocurrencies have over fiat currencies. A US dollar can only be divided to 2 decimal places. Bitcoin is divisible upto 8 decimal places. Some crypto currencies are divisible upto 30. I've noticed people tend to buy coins they can hold a lot of because of the attitude ""when this coin reaches a dollar, I'll be a millionaire"". If the coin is only currently worth half a cent, what is the true likelyhood that it is going to 200x its way to a $1? Be reasonable with your expectations and the way you invest your money. This means sometimes its worth it to buy a small fraction of a coin with a high price and fewer coins in circulation, rather than thousands of coins with a low price and more coins in circulation.",CryptoCurrency,Why understanding market cap is so important.

I am sure many people are confused as to what exactly is going on so I‚Äôve decided I would share with you some of my perspective. Most social platforms have ballooned into monolithic giants that hold a lot of sway over the way we consume information and interact on the web.   


Could decentralized technology be the key to breaking their hold over our online social lives, all while better connecting us to our interests and communities and protecting our data? Several competing networks already use decentralized approaches‚Äîand even Twitter, believe it or not, is investing in a potential decentralized future.   


There are other approaches out there for a decentralized social media experience but no one has really figured out how to solve the systemic problem that we are facing.[ The social network](https://social.network/) is another current example, and it is using a set of governance runtime modules and smart contracts on a decentralized, public, permissionless, proof-of-stake blockchain  


.As a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, The Social Network continuously allocates funds to Societies aligned with the global goals. Voted on by the token holders of a decentralized ledger, these missions can adapt over time to meet the needs of humanity.  


This is history in the making folks and over the next few weeks I expect massive developments in this blockchain based social platform to occur.

With the recent chaos in the financial markets, both stock and crypto, there's been a massive influx of new investors to our community. As of the time of me writing, we're the number 8 fastest growing community on Reddit! I think it's important that we use this chance to educate our newcomers so that they'll be better equipped to navigate this often confusing space and hopefully be able to contribute to the discussion in the future.

The objective of this post will be to explain some of the most important concepts that you'll encounter while investing in cryptocurrency. (I won't be covering the details of the technology in this post- for that, I recommend 3Blue1Brown's ""But how does bitcoin actually work?"" on Youtube. While it's tailored to Bitcoin, it explains the ins and outs of a basic blockchain.)

**VALUE FUNDAMENTALS:**

SPOT PRICE - This is the price that you frequently see associated with each coin. This is the price that you can expect to buy or sell at and have your order processed immediately. A ""Market Buy"" will immediately find you the lowest price seller, while a ""Market Sell"" will find you the highest price buyer. Alternatively, you can place a ""Limit Buy"" and name a price. For example, if coin X has a spot price of 140USD, you can set a Limit Buy for 135USD. This order will only execute once the price of coin X drops to 135USD or lower. The same applies to a Limit Sell, if the price rises to your chosen price or higher.

CIRCULATING SUPPLY - This is the number of any given coin that has been placed into the open market. Bitcoin, for example, currently has a circulating supply of 19 million coins. This is also the overall supply, as there is no governing body that holds the coin in reserve. Stellar is an example of differing circulating and total supplies; while there are 22.3 billion Stellar Lumens circulating, there are a total of 50 billion in existence. This is because Stellar has a non-profit governing body that holds roughly 27.7 billion Stellar Lumens in reserve to use for development and promotion.

MARKET CAP -  This is the overall valuation of a cryptocurrency. Simply put, ""Price x Supply = Market Cap"". For example, if coin X has a spot price of 20 dollars and a supply of 20 million, the market cap would be 400 million dollars. This is a better indicator of value than just the price. For example, XLM has a current price of 0.34USD, while AAVE is priced at 301.56USD. This would lead one to believe that AAVE is more valuable overall but 1000x, but it actually has just under half the market cap of XLM (3.7B vs 7.5B) due to vast supply differences. This is the issue with the ""DOGE TO A DOLLAR"" claim. It looks possible because it's a 96 cent movement in price, but the reality is that DOGE would have to increase by 125 Billion USD in overall valuation.

VOLUME - The number of coins traded over a period of time, almost always 24h. This is hard to provide concrete examples for, but is something you can get a feel for over time. A very rough explanation of this concept, is that higher volume trading is more representative of an accurate valuation. This is why you may see a coin's price drift around during off hours, then suddenly snap up or down along with comments in the daily thread saying ""Europe just woke up!""

**MISCELLANEOUS TERMS:**

HODL - Long term holding, especially through dips. Running joke in the crypto community, but also good advice.

DCA - Dollar Cost Averaging. This is an investing method where you buy small amounts over a period of time rather than a large amount all at once. This reduces your exposure to short-term volatility and is often recommended during dips.

ATH - All Time High. A new highest price that a particular coin has seen.

KYC - Know Your Customer. A set of regulations from governments that require exchanges to collect information on their customers. This is why you may be asked for your driver's license or SSN.

DeFi - Decentralized Finance. An ecosystem of permissionless banking, loans, and trading largely based on Ethereum.

CeFi - Centralized Finance. Banking, loans, and trading that require a central authority. Coinbase is an example of a CeFi brokerage, while UniSwap is an example of a DeFi brokerage.

ERC-20 Token - Any of a variety of tokens that are based on Ethereum. Examples include BAT, OMG, etc.

Hardware Wallet/Cold Storage: A method of storing cryptocurrency using a specialized external device that protects your private key from being exposed. You can access this wallet using your Hardware Wallet and PIN, or by putting your recovery phrase into any hardware wallet.

**YOU SHOULD KNOW:**

-NEVER SHARE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE. No one with hood inteions will EVER ask you for this. If your recovery phrase is entered into any electronic device other than a hardware wallet, assume you've been compromised.

-Do your own research. A lot of people are going to spam you with their favorite coin and pretend it has zero weaknesses. They do not care about you, they are trying to pump their coin.

-Cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile asset. +/-20% days are very common. Don't panic buy, don't panic sell.

-Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. The risks and rewards of crypto investing are both massive. On a related note, do not touch margin/leverage unless you are 100% sure what you're doing. You can and likely will lose MORE than you put in.

-Not your keys, not your crypto. Some exchanges, such as Robinhood or PayPal, allow you to ""buy"" crypto but don't allow you to send or withdraw it. You do not own this crypto, you own the right to track the price of their crypto. It is strongly recommended that you use an exchange that let's you withdraw your coins to an external wallet.

-Our daily threads run 24/7. If you want to bounce ideas around or join in the hype, hop on in. We don't bite.

-NEVER SHARE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE.

**CONCLUSION:**

This is generally a friendly and welcoming community. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask here or in the daily thread and myself or someone else will be more than happy to help you. In the near future, I plan to do this kind of post covering individual currencies. Let me know if you have suggestions or things you'd like to see.

\-

Are we still early to crypto?

‚ÄãLast week, I stumbled upon an old Medium post from venture capitalist Chris McCann. The Solana and FTX seed investor showed via simple graphs that in 2018, the space was just beginning.

Are we still there? Are we still following the same trend of exponential growth?

I revisited and updated the graphs to find out:

**Bitcoin Wallet Address Growth**

The first metric: unique Bitcoin wallet addresses. The amount of total Bitcoin wallets today is closing in on 900 million. In May 2018, the number was about 398 million, which, in turn, forty months before was about 60 million.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/az9hojyzn4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48f15cebda542a99f5175dfb41a1238398c274f2

So growth is slowing somewhat, although if we compare it to overall internet adoption, it‚Äôs tracking closely, as the rate of internet user growth leveled off over time as well.

It was in the 12th year of public use that the internet crossed one billion users, while Bitcoin is closing in on a billion addresses in its 13th year.

Then again, an address is not equivalent to a user, so it‚Äôs a bit more of a toss-up. Still, a doubling in three years is nothing to scoff at.

&amp;#x200B;

**Active Bitcoin Addresses:**

So how many of those addresses are actually active (that is, have sent or received any quantity of Bitcoin on a given day)? Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/16wzucv0o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91911f810e977fa3f677417918c75bb568fc1e0

For Bitcoin, two new peaks were reached in January and May of 2021 at approximately 1.25 million active wallets per day. The previous local peak was approximately 1.1 million in late 2017. Things in late 2017 looked to be going parabolic until transactions dropped down to 500,000/day in early 2018.

To me, this graph reflects on some of the transactional limitations related to Bitcoin. While there are definitely solutions to some of the volume-related problems surrounding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs possible that the slowing growth is correlated.

While it‚Äôd be impossible to collect the data for all cryptocurrencies, I‚Äôd postulate that growth is quite a bit higher for crypto as a whole. With 12,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, however, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to do the math.

**Ethereum Wallet Address Growth:**

&amp;#x200B;

The number of total wallets and active wallets on Ethereum both look to be catching up to Bitcoin, a great sign for the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole. The addition of L2s (blockchain ecosystems powered by altcoins built on top of Ethereum) probably actually underestimates these metrics as a proxy for how much total network activity exists.

That kick-up in late 2016 was due to an attack attempting to overwhelm Ethereum‚Äôs system with a high volume of addresses created.

We can also check out active wallets on Ethereum: this graph‚Äôs steadier growth and higher 2021 peaks lends credibility to our hypothesis that overall network capability leads to more activity growth. While Bitcoin‚Äôs percentage of active wallets has slowly dropped (about .3% in 2018), Ethereum‚Äôs percentage of active wallets stays more consistent.‚Äã

**Exchange Activity:**

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn‚Äôt find great compiled data on total exchange user growth over time, but we can use volume to understand how much money flows through crypto markets. ‚Äã

While this graph roughly traces Bitcoin price activity, we can see that higher highs have a multiplying effect on exchange volume: a total crypto market cap doubling leads to about 3 times as much exchange activity. For evidence of this, check out Jan 2018 vs. Jun 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchange Market Share:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/28fphcv6o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f729e20669c2b5f57ff601396a3609d4f57de51b

Removing decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap from the picture, we‚Äôve seen a massive broadening of the exchange landscape. Only a few exchanges (Coinbase and Binance, most notably) have been able to increase market share as a percentage. Including data from DEXs further muddies the waters.

I think this is an incredibly bullish sign for crypto growth and a real-life example of the concept of decentralization. If we look at the search engine wars of the early 2000s, at this point in time (relative to years since public launch), Google had well over half of market share. Binance barely cracks 15%.

There are two ways to look at this, but both are good signs for crypto investors:

1. If crypto forever remains decentralized in terms exchange volume, without any one player gaining too strong of an advantage, that‚Äôs a good thing for crypto.
2. If crypto exchange volume does someday consolidate, it will be a long time from now, which means we‚Äôre early.

Internationalization, decentralization, and different value propositions by exchanges are all good signs that we‚Äôre still early to crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

**Total Adoption by User Rates:**

One of the most fascinating parts of Chris McCann‚Äôs analysis was his comparison of crypto growth to internet growth. DeutscheBank has since done its own study of the blockchain vs. the internet, below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p4lb0ax7o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db2309c2bb3d84d9b431410cf83ee2b06eeea64f

The first thing to note is that these two graphs exist on different axes and have already diverged. It is almost definitive now that crypto will grow slower than the internet, while in 2018 it was still a tossup as to which might grow faster.

But while crypto‚Äôs growth has been slower than the internet‚Äôs, the coefficient of that growth might be accelerating.

In their projections, DeutscheBank guessed that by 2030, total cryptocurrency users would cross 200 million. But today, in September, we sit at well over 220 million users by many estimates, fueled by a manic bull run.

The math shows that it‚Äôd be quite difficult for crypto‚Äôs overall user base to overtake the internet‚Äôs user base at an equivalent point in time. However, it looks quite possible that crypto crosses a billion users much sooner than expected and, well, that‚Äôd be pretty good news for crypto prices.

**‚Äã**

**So...Are We Early?**

In 2018, many graphs pointed to crypto taking the same path as the internet to complete world domination. Today, though, it‚Äôs harder to have that same level of optimism.

While at this point, we know crypto won‚Äôt be quicker to worldwide adoption than the internet, at this point in time, it's on a good track to eventually get there.

Here‚Äôs what we can state with certainty:

1. Growth in the crypto world has slowed down.
2. There are now over 200 million cryptocurrency users.
3. Things have never been so bullish for crypto.

While McCann in 2018 could fairly compare the growth of crypto to the growth of the internet as a whole, perhaps today, making that comparison is a little too optimistic.

&amp;#x200B;

**The New Frontiers of Crypto**

Chris McCann‚Äôs article serves as a bit of a time capsule to cryptocurrency in 2018, without a mention of DeFi or NFTs: the concepts barely even existed yet.

&gt;""My biggest criticism towards the DApp future is we haven‚Äôt seen DApp usage keep pace with the number of DApps being created. The current core use cases of cryptocurrencies are speculation, store of value, assets, payments, etc.‚Äù

Today, though there are many use cases for crypto! DeFi, yield farming, loans, decentralized exchanges, platforms like Theta and Audius which hold data on the blockchain.

So as far as where the next opportunities in cryptocurrency lie, it‚Äôs likely that you haven‚Äôt even heard of them yet: and it‚Äôs that way by nature. Small projects with big ideas have a lot more room for growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case Studies on Parabolic growth**

To illustrate my point, I‚Äôd like to show a few graphs that couldn‚Äôt have even been imaginable three years ago. Here‚Äôs a graph from TheBlockCrypto.com of the total value of the assets locked in DeFi:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sole5jt9o4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3483656efc875bfaeb820577562661bed582b11d

A sector of the industry Chris didn't even touch on has now almost kissed $100 billion! Unthinkable three years ago.‚Äã

And below is a graph of volume on NFT marketplaces. A year ago, Opensea did under $50k in daily volume. Today, it will do approximately $90 million. That‚Äôs an 1800x in just one year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pyawfbtao4p71.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ac4b036ddb06b9c83ef310f180f6f75b197be5

If you‚Äôre investing in crypto, well, it‚Äôs evident that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have slowed down in growth: and that makes sense: it‚Äôs harder to move the price of assets as they grow in size.

‚ÄãBut if you want to know where to find that explosive 10x, 100x, 1000x investment, it‚Äôs the new trends **within** cryptocurrency, it's the cutting edge, the latest innovations, that have the potential to explode.

**For me, that means investing in the altcoins and protocols that will serve as facilitators for this new world of online wealth creation.**

For you, it might be something else: Yield Farming, DeFi, decentralized insurance. Explore what's new, explore your curiosity, and you might just find something that explodes.

These past few weeks have definitely been one of the most exciting for most Bitcoin holders (including me).

Finally, all the talk of $100k seems natural and almost inevitable. We even touched a $1 trillion market cap, which many would have considered a pipe dream some months ago.

But I've chosen to single out this one chart because Just a few months ago, I was making charts about how many days Bitcoin has spent above $20k. 

Fast forward to the present, we're sitting above $40k and pretty comfortably. We've also had a brief stint above $50k which lasted six days and a day respectively.

In my opinion, it's only a matter of time until we reclaim and make the $50k territory our own. 

It's been a breathtaking runup and it could get even more exciting in the coming months!

Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)

But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes farming insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.

There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to farm currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the ""broker"" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form farming communities where they work together to discreetly farm and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.

So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.

The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective,¬†I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from farming that I do practicing law. I am still working,¬†but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.

I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.

1612454098,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lcio2a/moon_distribution_what_can_we_expect_to_see_a/,81,53," A question that's been floating around the subreddit that I've noticed recently is what the rate of karma to MOON distribution will be when they are next distributed- which, from what I've learned will be the 16th. I've seen a lot of figures floating around, with estimates ranging as high as .75 to as low as .2- and, obviously, such a wide range cannot provide an accurate estimate of what we will get for our karma in 22 days. So, what would actually be an accurate estimate of the upcoming MOON to karma distribution?

Before we get started, I'd like to establish several clear numbers and dates that will be important to know for the math I am about to perform.
Firstly, MOON distribution operates on a four-week cycle. The last cycle ended on January 19th- so, presumably, the next distribution date will be the 16th. This is very important, because the activity of the subreddit within this cycle will be utterly crucial to measuring the next distribution of MOONs.
Secondly, the last moon distribution was around .85. This is the number I have heard from various people on the subreddit, and I've checked it to the best of my ability. This seems to be an accurate-ish total, and I'll be using it as a basis for a lot of my calculations.
Thirdly, MOON distribution began at 5 million, and decreases by 2.5% every month. Since, from what I can tell, there have been 9 rounds of distribution with 8 following the percentage decrease model, there should be approximately 4.08 million MOONs available next cycle- while there was about 4.2 million available last cycle.

So, with these numbers established, what can we do with them?
 
The equation for MOONs themselves is a relatively simple one- you simply divide the total karma generated that month by the total of MOONs. Unfortunately, there's no real easy way to calculate the total karma generated during a certain period. So, how do we calculate the upcoming MOON total? More or less, I'm going to compare the total post/comment activity of the last MOON cycle with the projected total post/comment activity of this MOON cycle. This method is, obviously, inaccurate- but it will provide significantly more clarity than just guessing. Additionally, I will use three estimates for the total projected activity this month- a low-end estimate, a median estimate, and a high-end estimate. 

So, what was the total post/comment activity of the last MOON cycle?

After some arduous calculation, I came to these totals:

167722 total comments
8353 total posts 

Since 4.2 million moons were distributed at a ratio of .85, one can only assume that approximately 4.9 million karma, in total, was gathered by these combined posts and comments. Now, obviously, it would be utterly hellish to try and go find where this 4.9 million karma originated from or how it was distributed- but we can assume the majority of it resulted from the comments. Additionally, this figure is almost certainly not an accurate estimate of total karma, due to the fact that post karma is halved- if we assume that all posts and comments got the same amount of upvotes, with 5% of the karma total, or 245k going to posts, we can assume that posts actually got 490k karma total- which actually seems like a relatively reasonable total, considering. But, of course, this is beside the point- we need to use this total to calculate MOONs. 

For the moment, I will focus on comment karma distribution, as since it makes up assumedly 95% of all karma generated, it is the far more significant figure. 95% of 4.9 million is 4.65 million which, when divided by the total number of comments, gives us the figure of 27.7 average karma per comment. This is immensely useful, as we will be using it for the basis of our projected total karma for the next period. Using similar methods we can calculate the total average karma per post: 490k/8.3k is equivalent to approximately 59 average karma per post. For the purposes of this inquiry, I will be halving this figure, as post karma is halved when MOON distribution is taken into consideration. 

So, two more important figures. The average karma per comment is around 28, and the average karma per post, halved, is approximately 30. 

Now, all that remains to do is project the total amount of post/comment activity for the rest of this cycle, and we‚Äôre done. But, of course, this isn‚Äôt all that easy, either. If you take a look at the [statistics for r/cryptocurrency](https://subredditstats.com/r/cryptocurrency), in the last days of January and the first few of February this sub experienced an utterly massive spike; which adds a massive amount of uncertainty to any prediction. I have a method for addressing this, however. I will create three assumed futures for this subreddit- one where activity remains consistent around this massive spike, one where it decreases to a more reasonable level, and one where it continues to grow at a large rate. For those interested, the formula I am using is M = MT/((P x PT) + (C x CT)) where M equals the moon to karma ratio, MT equals the total moons available for distribution, P represents the post karma average, PT represents the cycle post total, C represents the comment karma average, and CT represents the cycle comment total. 

Now, to be clear, I am only projecting the remaining 14 days of the cycle. I am adding the total post/comment karma from the 14 days of this cycle that we have already experienced to my projected total for the remaining 14 days to calculate the total amount of karma for the cycle- again, for this interested, the total already-generated post karma for this cycle is 7722, and the total already-generated comment karma for this cycle is 93,534.

Thusly, here are my projections:

A: Assuming the subreddit continues to grow at a decent rate, the total average comments/posts  could potentially end up being approximately 17k comments per day and 900 posts per day. In this case we get a total average of approximately .42 moons per karma, and I‚Äôd say that given the inaccuracies built into this model, the true average could be anywhere from .4 to .45. If the subreddit utterly booms in this time, I would expect the lowest possible moon distribution to be at around .35 moons per karma.

B: Assuming the subreddit remains stable at the current activity, the total average comments/posts would remain at around 13k comments per day and 800 posts per day. In this case, we see an average of .50 moons per karma- which many people actually predicted! Of course, with the inaccuracies built in, this could be anywhere from .48 to .52 in reality.

C: Assuming the subreddit goes into a heady decline- as to why, I suppose you could say a crash in the market, or some form of new moderation policy- we could probably see a reversion to earlier levels of activity with around 6.5k comments per day and around 250 posts per day. In this case, we would see approximately .74 moons per karma, and, assuming inaccuracies, that could be anywhere from .72 to .76 in reality. 

TL;DR- if the sub keeps booming, expect to get .4-.35 moons per karma. If the sub stays the same, expect to get .5. If the sub dies, expect to get .75. 

So, these are my predictions for the upcoming MOON distribution on the 16th. Of course, there are a lot of small things I forgot to factor in- MOON interest, the 500 comment limit, and so forth. The data simply just doesn‚Äôt exist for me to model those in, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for me to exclude them. Of course, there are probably a lot of problems with this analysis, and this is most likely greatly inaccurate- feel free to lambast me as such in the comments. The assumptions I made in regard to average post/comment karma are probably the worst. But I wanted to try and find an actual answer to this question, and this is my best attempt. Let me know what you think!

EDIT: I'm making this effort over a day after I posted this, and as such most people probably won't see this- but, for the sake of accuracy, I should mention that I misinterpreted a lot of the proposal posts. A lot of things did not pass that I thought, did- so no such thing exists as a 500 comment limit, or MOON distribution relative to post length.",CryptoCurrency,MOON distribution- what can we expect to see?

It all started as a half drunk bet between my boyfriend and I. I could double our money in less than 24 hours. I like games and I sure as hell like a good gamble. And that‚Äôs what shitcoins pretty much are. Sure, every coin has to start somewhere but unfortunately, scammers have made it hard to pick out the legit ones.

I was wanting a gamble though, so I didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm going to name the coin because it‚Äôs now worthless but I think it‚Äôs a good idea to say it. It was a sexy name and can easily be used again in a scam. Frostfire. 

I found it at around 6pm on the day it launched. It was around 10 minutes old and only had a few wallets. I searched Reddit and google. Nothing. I bought some anyways. I wanted a gamble. I put $50 in and got 1 trillion coins. Sweet.

Fast forward to an hour later, I was up double my money. My boyfriend told me to pull out but I couldn‚Äôt. Fomo was real.

Another hour later I was up to $200. Boyfriend told me to pull out but I definitely wasn‚Äôt at this point. And I found a telegram for it.

Fast forward to 4 hours later and I believe I was up to $1k. My boyfriend was sleeping and I was riding this out.

8-10 hours after putting $50 in, the market cap hit 1million. My $50 was now over $5k. I couldn‚Äôt pull out at this point. I was so sure I‚Äôd hit the jackpot. I felt like those damn baboons that fall for the salt traps in the Amazon. I thankfully pulled out $500 just in case.

I woke up the next morning to it being down to $2k. Not great but it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs only stabilizing I told myself. The dev got active on telegram and a bunch of people started buying again. Back up to $4k almost $1million mc.

There were a lot of red flags on telegram and a lot of bots in the Reddit comments but I chose to ignore them. Then over the next day we got slowly rug pulled until my $5k was worth $200 that I managed to pull before it was completely worthless. The dev deleted the website and telegram.

Ouch. I spent the next week trying to find the next Frostfire and lost about $200. And then I just started looking up new coins on bscscan and lurking the telegram and poocoin out of curiosity. I made a rule that no matter how much I believed in a coins potential I wouldn‚Äôt buy a brand new shitcoin until it survived the first week at least.

Guess what? They never did.

My advice? Don‚Äôt put your money into a coin unless it‚Äôs been audited. I did my homework every time and even when there was a burn wallet and no major whales, a liquidity pool, a rug pull always happened. 

And if you‚Äôre going to anyways, expect your money to be gone.

Best way to get rich? Do some good DD and put any money that you don‚Äôt need into some projects that have a purpose or aim to satisfy a need. And don‚Äôt ever chase losses.

1614805961,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx4hv1/i_have_seen_a_substantial_amount_of/,168,213,"***TLDR***: The real TPS of any network will vary drastically, as the size of the transactions also varies drastically. Moreover, different networks have differing transaction data needs and norms, making this figure largely incomparable across blockchains. For now, Cardano has a rough present speed cap of about 7 TPS, and anyone telling you Cardano has a network TPS above even 10TPS is talking out of their ass. That said, it's low specifically because network use is low, and so higher TPS is totally unnecessary. Cardano can scale its potential TPS to current network utilization and current technology relatively simply by changing a single network parameter, which can be adjusted manually now by IOG, or voted on in the future. Thus, they can increase the network speed up into the neighborhood of \~50 TPS almost immediately without expected issues. Longer-term scaling and optimizations really will make a major difference, so saying more is difficult.

\---

Let's begin by talking about the main factors that can influence the number of transactions a modern blockchain network can process per second. The first factor that influences transaction speed is the rate at which these bundles are written and approved by multiple network validators. In Cardano, blocks are written in at an average rate of [1 block every 20 seconds](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/explore-cardano/how-are-new-blocks-produced.html). That said, transactions per second then also depends on how many transactions are included in those bundles. The more transactions in each of those bundles, the more transactions are being processed per second.

Things might seem simple up to this point, but this is actually where TPS gets really complicated. Why? Because the number of transactions in a block varies ***a ton***.

To understand this complication, first recognize that most blockchains don't actually care about *number* of transactions when processing blocks, they care about the *data size* of those transactions. At the end of the day, a transaction in a blockchain is just a set of information describing what happened - who sent how much to where? Or in the case of smart contracts, who sent what to where, and what needs to happen as a result? So it's the case that some transactions take up a lot of data space, while others take up very little.

Most modern blockchains, including Cardano, then choose to set a cap on how much data each block being written can contain in terms of *bytes*, not in terms of number of transactions. In Cardano, they call this parameter the ""maxBlockSize."" This value is a delicate balance: setting the limit too high means that these huge blocks of data can be created every 20 seconds, and these big blocks need to be shared with every single person on the network - so bigger blocks can mean slower uptake, more security vulnerabilities, and potentially more costly storage for transactions overall. Conversely, setting the limit too low means that each block can barely contain any information at all, and the network becomes incapable of handling higher loads of use - leading to network congestion and long transaction delays. So setting any one maxBlockSize (or whatever your network calls it) comes with a number of trade-offs, and it's a constantly moving target as network usage changes, technology changes (i.e. cost of hard drive space, networking speeds, etc.), and the type of transactions being conducted changes.

Thus, transactions per second relies on how many blocks are being produced (which is easy), but also the average size of each transaction in bytes (which can and will change based on how the network is being used), and the maximum size of each block being produced (which can also change). This is why anyone spouting off TPS figures is probably misguided - **the real TPS of any network will vary drastically, as the size of the transactions also varies drastically**. At best, you can estimate an *average maximum TPS* for a network, but that is subject to change for a variety of reasons unrelated to the speed of the network.

Moreover, **different networks have differing transaction data needs and norms**, making this figure largely incomparable across blockchains - so it's not even a good reference metric. Small transaction sizes is not necessarily a good thing, but they do make high TPS values way easier to attain; likewise, big transaction sizes is not necessarily a bad thing, but they make high TPS values almost impossible without suffering from issues like network/propagation latency and blockchain bloat. For example, as u/StatisticalMan helpfully explained, ""a Maker DAO vault registration smart contract \[on Ethereum\] requires 30x the gas (\~600,000) as a simple send ETH from wallet A to wallet B transaction (21,000). So if you removed all smart contracts from Ethereum well it could handle a lot more tx per block. It would also be nearly useless... The reason why blocks are full on ETH is because people are doing really interesting complicated things. Decentralized swaps, decentralized lending, collateralized loans, nft creation, decentralized stablecoin minting, decentralized options pools, decentralized crypto mutual funds, etc."" In other words, given the inherent trade-off between TPS and transaction size for many blockchains, a high TPS is not necessarily desirable in and of itself.

***For now***, know that the maxBlockSize of Cardano is set at 65536 bytes (per [adapools](https://adapools.org/protocol-parameters)). This is kind of an abstract number, so let's set some reference points. Looking at the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en), we can see that as of writing, most transactions are somewhere in the neighborhood of 450 bytes on average. Thus, we can fit about 146 average-sized transactions in a single block, for a **rough present speed cap of about 7 TPS** (146 average-sized transactions being processed every 20 seconds). I want to make this super clear: **anyone telling you Cardano has a network TPS above even 10TPS is talking out of their ass** or is just regurgitating abstract theoretical numbers they heard somewhere.

""But wait, that sounds like **absolutely nothing**. I thought Cardano was supposed to be the network of the future?"" Yes, remember that I emphasized ***for now***.

First, because maxBlockSize is a network parameter for Cardano, that value can be changed very simply. The responsibility of setting or changing this parameter is currently in the hands of IOG, but once Voltaire and on-chain voting systems are fully developed, the community will be able to propose and vote on changes to this value at any time. This is absolutely *critical*, and is one of the strengths of Cardano as a network, because it means **we can scale our potential TPS to current network utilization and current technology** (remember from earlier that setting block size is a careful balance). If you look back at the blocks being produced on the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en), you'll notice that blocks are no where *even close* to the current maxBlockSize of 65536 - they're more in the neighborhood of 10000 bytes and below. What this means is that the current network utilization is *not at all* being capped by the network's current transaction speed. We simply aren't even close to hitting the low cap of \~7TPS on a regular basis, and thus setting the maxBlockSize higher right now will just lead to a lot of empty blocks and an unnecessarily data-heavy blockchain overall. But if we **do** start to get to a bottleneck, changing this parameter and **increasing the network speed up into the neighborhood of \~50 TPS can happen almost immediately without an issue** (as reported by [IOG engineers running stress tests](https://youtu.be/gpSnyCn2s9U)). It is unclear how much higher we can set the maxBlockSize at present without introducing more latency issues, but 50 is a very reasonable estimate by my figuring, the video linked, and the [in-depth technical paper by IOG](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/introduction-to-the-design-of-the-data-diffusion-and-networking-for-cardano-shelley/) (see Table 6 on pg 42).

Second, the average transaction size in bytes is likely to change substantially over time. With the recent release of the Mary update introducing native tokens to the network, transactions may contain more data than before. Once smart contracts are fully deployed on the network via the final Goguen update, a single smart contract transaction may end up being bigger than what we see today for regular transactions. At the same time, Charles and IOG folks have consistently alluded to optimizing how the data in transactions are stored similar to what [Ethereum has been and is doing](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html). The thinking goes, if you can communicate the same transaction with less data, you can fit more transactions in the same block and increase the TPS of the network almost ""for free."" All said, the current average transaction size of 450 bytes is unlikely to hold much longer, and the network will be ready to change and adapt as necessary given the ability to vote on parameters like the maxBlockSize.

Third, there are a variety of future updates to the Cardano protocol that can really change things up and speed the network up even further. The big one to keep an eye on is [Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/26/enter-the-hydra-scaling-distributed-ledgers-the-evidence-based-way/), which can radically increase the TPS of the Cardano network theoretically well above 1000 TPS. Even my old skeptical bones has [calculated a conservative bottom-end](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lbk83x/ouroboros_hydra_constrained_by_l1_tps/glusgth?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for TPS in Hydra at around 2500 TPS at the absolute worst (i.e. in a world where protocol optimizations cap us out at 50 TPS, rather than the big-blue-sky figures Charles Hoskinson tends to toss out at 100-1000+). Thus, once we can't scale the network to adapt to high usage past adjusting maxBlockSize and optimizing transactions themselves, Hydra can get us *well* beyond what would likely be necessary. That also ignores any future developments to the protocol that introduce other solutions for scaling - and we have plenty of time between now and then. Charles Hoskinson has also made it clear that Hydra and solutions like Rollups are not mutually exclusive: ""[We'll get them eventually](https://youtu.be/O1EOgP8NFZU).""

So, long as hell post, but hopefully that tells you what you need to know about TPS, Cardano's network speed, and the potential future for network usage. Would love reactions, pushback, questions, etc. - I'll do my best to answer.

I was replying to a thread asking about this but the message got so long I figured I could make it into its own post to remind everyone that NANO isn't perfect, and hopefully spark up some discussion. The main disadvantages I know after being here for a while and investing myself:

## 1. No smart contracts

Some may argue that this is an advantage, while others consider smart contracts the future of crypto; that's up to you. It does make sense that NANO isn't supporting them for technological reasons, and that's ok. Nano doesn't have to be the only coin in the planet and can coexist with coins that are specifically made to support smart contracts and thus better at it.

## 2. Lacking privacy

It's just as private as BTC, which is already pretty successful. Besides, not sure if it would cause regulation issues, as others have pointed out in different posts. I'd love for privacy in a coin to be an advantage but it doesn't seem like it in our society.

Anyway, this can be solved to some extent in the second layer.

## 3. Deflationary currency

There haven't been any successful deflationary currencies yet AFAIK. The only time that happened was with [Japan's Lost Decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan\\)), which wasn't going to end well according to expert economists. I don't know enough about the topic to discuss more about it and I still have some reading to do, but my current research isn't too optimistic. Not because it's impossible, but due to the fact that it has never happened before, which makes actual Nano adoption harder and another challenge to overcome.

I suggest everyone to learn more about this themselves. It's a very interesting topic. There's [this small book I haven't read yet](https://cdn.mises.org/Deflation%20and%20Liberty_2.pdf), [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErUQnd-YFGg), and [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdYUQxD01_0&amp;amp;t=2s), but look for more yourself.

## 4. Is it really a good enough fiat replacement?

NANO is great, **but is it great enough to replace fiat for your average Joe?**

* Consider that the average fiat user doesn't care about decentralization at all. If anything, it's worse for them: it's harder to set up, understand, and they have to keep private keys safe.

My father is unable to understand how cryptocurrencies work. Thus, he doesn't plan on using them as he doesn't trust crypto at all.
* NANO is green, but not that much in comparison to fiat -- at least when we're talking about digital fiat transactions. Would like to see facts and an objective comparison on both physical and digital fiat, though.
* NANO is instant... just like fiat, or at least for day-to-day amounts and between close communities. Nano is a global currency; it shines with larger amounts and between banks from unrelated countries. For example [SEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) transfers are limited to Europe and are slow AF, and other methods have fees and are also quite slow. But that's not really something the average Joe cares about, he just wants to pay for the beer he just had.
* NANO is feeless: that *is* something nice. But converting *to* NANO does have fees, which is required to use it (although less important). I don't think we'll ever get rid of all middlemen, and we'll always have to deal with fees, although probably much smaller. Not that big of a deal, but something to take into account.

Here's an example regarding adoption I've experienced myself and consider in the same situation as crypto:

I'm a huge Linux fan and user, and it is objectively better than Windows in many ways: it respects your privacy, is open and transparent, and completely free. It's usually a bit more performant, and you have full control over it. Yet, not more than 5% of desktop users run this OS, and most are tech-savvy people.

I'd love it if this happened, but the advantages just won't convince average Windows users to switch, because it's a somewhat complicated process for the tech illiterate or they just don't care enough.

Some are also confused about why there are so many distros and which one is best (same as crypto), specially considering that the user of a distro (coin/token) will tell you their own is the best one. Sometimes we are our own enemies. Not to mention that Windows (fiat) is the most used platform, which means there's less support for Linux (nano) sometimes. That makes it a big reason why people don't want to switch their OS (currency).

The issues in this section don't mean that the switch to crypto is impossible. Only that it's going to take muuuuuch more time than most of their users think, and that it could take many generations IMO. Considering cryptocurrencies are *just* starting to get attention now, it's to be expected -- you can't change the world in two days. This also affects all kinds of cryptocurrencies, not just Nano, so at least it's something we all fight together against.

## 5. No node incentive

It can only make sense that without fees nor inflation there's not much incentive to run a node. There's just no way around it. I can get behind the common counter-argument that companies that use NANO run nodes to secure their own holdings, which so far has been working well, but it's something to be aware of and that we don't have much experience with.

## 6. Spam attack

Spam is also a concern: if Nano is instant and feeless, what prevents a Nano hater from spamming the network?

As this post is being written we're under a small spam attack. [We're at ~30 Transations Per Second](https://nanolooker.com/), while we're usually at ~2, so about a x15 increase. Is Nano any slower? Not really. With Nano's model of having a blockchain per account, ledger bloat is also reduced; only full nodes need the entire history and storage is quite cheap (and pruning hasn't even been implemented yet). While this is a relatively small attack and we should work on preventing them, there are many ways to approach this and it might get better as Nano gets more usage.

## 7. Devs could do better

Don't take me wrong. I value the time and effort put into the Nano foundation and all its members for creating this coin, but for instance I think it could be more transparent. I'd love to have a more in-depth analysis of the foundation's expendings and regarding decisions taken about Nano's future (most technological decisions are nicely explained in their [medium account](https://medium.com/nanocurrency)). The [whole Appia thing](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/q-a-with-colin-lemahieu-recap-48dd61cc320b) has already been talked about many times and I don't want to beat a dead horse. I support it, but I consider it could have been a much more transparent process. I would also like to see a clearer roadmap than a GitHub project.

But considering that cryptocurrencies seek decentralization, and that Nano is proven to be mostly a community project, I'd like the dev team having as little power as possible (to some extent). I don't think it's important that e.g. the devs promote Nano. See for example the [guy who just started an ad campaign on PornHub](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lufruq/25_million_impressions_five_thousand_clicks_and/). It's just a different way of doing things, and I prefer it.

## 8. Bitgrail

Most posts like this one include [the Bitgrail scam](https://www.coinbureau.com/analysis/bitgrail-nano-saga-twisted-tale-hacks-threats-lawsuit/) as a temporary disadvantage, as some lost a lot of money. It was just a bad experience overall, and some people only know Nano because of this. I don't consider this a huge disadvantage, but I wanted to include at least a mention.

## 9. Epoch blocks are centralized

Here's one I didn't know about: the epoch blocks are a centralized solution. The upgrade itself was decentralized because all nodes agreed to do so, but it's only up to the team to add epoch blocks from that moment on. Read more about it [here](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/an-epoch-blocks-explainer-aa22905b28db) and see more discussion here: [[1]](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/9pabov/an_epoch_block_explainer/) [[2]](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/hwijl2/nano_epoch_v2_blocks_explained/).

What is special about Optimistic Rollups is that they are VERY easy for DAPPS like Uniswap, Compound, Aave, etc to implement.

They basically copy paste their code over into Optimism and voila they're on L2. 

Uniswap is currently by far the largest contributor to ETH congestion and high fees (making up about 30% of fees alone on ETH) 

Once Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound and these other major Dapps implement L2 all the congestion is going to come off of Ethereum which means transaction volume is going to shoot through the ROOF but will be done so for pennies.

This is the most bullish news to the ETH space but you will not hear it emphasized because of all the FUD going around saying eTh CaNt ScALE.

1623693148,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nzslya/algorand_community_governance_scheduled_for_oct_1/,237,114,"Community Governance:

Q1: What is Community Governance?

Community Governance represents the governance program that marks the shift from the early days of the Algorand network  to a more mature phase in which the community takes charge of its own destiny and rewards are distributed in return for verifiable engagement in the program. 

Q2: Why is the Community Governance Program important? 

The Community Governance program is important since it gives decision power about the future of Algorand to the Algorand community. It introduces a form of governance that is simultaneously decentralized, secure and efficient, like our consensus protocol.

Q3: What is a Governor?

Governors are Algo holders who commit a stake for a 3 month governance period which will enable Governor voting on some of the most important decisions regarding ecosystem development.

Q4: What is the role of Governors?

Governors will be responsible for major economic and policy decisions. This will be done via periodic voting, whereby Algorand Foundation will then execute responsibly, for the benefits of the overall ecosystem, based on the Governor‚Äôs decisions.

Q5: Who can participate in Community Governance? 

All Algo holders are invited to become Governors and vote on important decisions regarding ecosystem development. Their votes will depend on the amount of Algos they will commit to governance for a 3 month period.

Q6: Is there a minimum/maximum number of governors?

There is no minimum/maximum number of governors. This is an open program and anyone willing to commit their Algos and vote can become governors.

Q7: Will Algorand Foundation itself vote in Community Governance? 

The Foundation will not vote or earn rewards in Community Governance. Its only role will be to set up the voting options and indicate its favorite option. Governors that want to do so will be allowed to opt to endorse automatically the Foundation‚Äôs preferred choice, but no Algo controlled by the foundation will be committed to governance.

Q8: When can I participate in Community Governance? 

The program will commence in Q4 2021 (details on the exact date to come) and will feature quarterly entry points, allowing participants to join the program on a voluntary basis. 

Q9: When do I have to sign up for the program?

The program will commence in Q4 2021. We expect you to be able to sign up in September just before the inception period. We will communicate any updates on when you can join the program in due course.

Q10: How can I participate in Community Governance? 

The Governors will have to commit an amount of Algos for a minimum of 3 months (length of a governing period). Technical details on how to participate will be made available in advance.

Q11: Do I need to provide any identification (KYC) to participate in Community Governance?

No, there are no requirements to do so.

Q12: What wallet(s) do I need to use to participate in Community Governance?  

During the inception period of the program, any wallet that can hold Algos can be used to participate in the governance program. As the program evolves Governors may need to use wallets with smart-contract support. Algorand Foundation will work with our partners to provide easy access to the governance program.

Q13: I have an account with an exchange. Can I participate in Community Governance and get Governance rewards? 

This will depend on the exchange. Please contact your exchange directly.

Q14: How was the Community Governance proposal formulated? 

The Community Governance proposal was inspired by Silvio Micali‚Äôs original governance proposal and then finalized by a number of  governance discussions facilitated by the Foundation, such as  the Algorand Governance Forum, the Algorand Governance Channel on Discord, and several other community engagements.

Q15: Will there be a platform where we can closely evaluate the list of tasks before we vote?

The Foundation will submit the list of tasks to the Governors every quarter, providing the Governors in advance with all the available background needed to allow informed decision-making by the Governors. We will provide further information in due course.

Q16: Has the Dutch auction format been dropped? It looks like the return will simply be determined by the number of participants in each cohort.

The Dutch auction idea has not been dropped but it is a more complex mechanism than the mechanism chosen for Governance. All Governors who commit will all receive the same rate of rewards which will be known after each governance period. 

Q17: Will the identity of any governors be disclosed and if so will this depend on the number of Algos that they have staked?

We encourage large stakeholders to disclose and publicly announce what they will be  committing but this is not a requirement.

Q18: Is it required or recommended that a person have any specific knowledge or skills to serve as a Governor? I would like to participate, but I'm concerned that issues I would be asked to vote upon will be way over my head.

The type of topics will be wide ranging and we are not looking for all Governors to be familiar with all topics. This is why the delegation of votes is beneficial especially on topics where you are not as familiar.

Q19: I have Exodus tokens, will I be able to vote or do I have to move my Algo? 

If you have an Algorand wallet that you control exclusively (Algorand address) you will be able to participate in voting, at least in the inception period. Final plans are not finalised and will be shared in due course.

Q20: Can the terms of the governance (e.g. size of AERP) be altered, at a later date, through a vote of the governors?

Yes, this is a possibility. Any reforms will be the role of Governors to vote on.

Participation Rewards:

Q21: Is Community Governance rewards replacing Participation Rewards? 

The Governance program will start in Q4 and will distribute rewards to Governors in addition to participation rewards. Participants to the Governance program will therefore see their total rewards grow significantly above the then fixed level of participation rewards. In 2022, participation rewards will be phased out, to be completely replaced by increasing Governance Rewards.

Q22: What is the exact date, current Participation rewards will finish in 2022?

The exact date has not been confirmed yet. We will share this information when available. 

Governance Rewards:

Q23: What are the requirements to be eligible for Governance Rewards?

Governors MUST maintain their committed Algo balance throughout each full 3-month period. In other words, Governors cannot move the amount of Algo committed in the designated wallet for the entire period. In addition, they must participate in all the votes during that period.

Q24: In order to commit ALGOs as a Governor does one simply need to maintain a certain balance in the Algo Wallet? What is the minimum amount of ALGO to be delegated as a Governor?

In terms of a minimum commitment, 1 committed Algo equals 1 vote. Regarding the balance, you need to maintain the balance amount of Algo you committed to the governance period. For example, if you commit 100 Algo to Governance you must maintain at least 100 Algo throughout the Governance period.

Q25: How are Community Governance Rewards managed/distributed each governance period? 

Governing wallets that participated in the vote and maintained their committed number of Algos for the full governance period will be able to claim their rewards at the end of the relevant governance period. Governors who miss a vote, or fail to maintain their committed number of Algos during any point of time in the relevant governance period, will not be entitled to their rewards for that governance period. 

Q26: At the end of the Governance period can I spend/use the rewards earned? 

Yes, earned rewards can be spent/used as you wish. 

Q27: Are the rewards you receive at the end of each governance quarter based on the Algos you commit at the start of the quarter or is it subject to change if you add more to your commitment throughout the quarter? Which leads to the question, can you add to your commitment after your initial commitment?

Your rewards will be based on what you commit at the beginning of each Governance period. What you commit at the beginning is the measure of your commitment to Governance. There is no issue if you commit additional Algos to the same wallet to be used for future Governance.

Q28: Will rolling over be automatically done for Governors from the previous period?

No. Governors will have to explicitly commit to becoming Governors for each Governance period.

Q18: Do I need to recommit anew for every Governance period? 

Yes. 

Q29: Will I require a new wallet address to participate in Governance? 

Governors can use their existing wallet address to participate in governance, or they can establish a new wallet address specifically for this purpose. It may be the easiest option to create a wallet specifically to manage your commitment to Governance. 

Q30: How can I declare my account to be the participating account?

Details on how to participate will be made available soon.

Q31: What is the commitment period which is required to earn Community Governance Rewards? 

Governors serve for a 3-month governance period at a time, committing a fixed amount of Algos for this said period. Governors must ensure they participate in all votes and maintain their committed number of Algos for the entire governance period in order to claim their rewards at the end of the governance period.

Q32: Why do I need to commit Algos to participate? 

Governors have to commit Algos to show they are willing to put skin in the game and align their incentives to those of the community. Additionally, Algorand is a proof-of-stake blockchain and the governance voting power will be proportional to the committed stake in governance. (1 Committed Algo = 1 Vote)

Q33: What is the Governance Rewards Rate for each governance period? 

The rewards rate will vary per period. This will be determined by the number of committed Algos, and computed as the ratio of the total Algos being committed against the total reward pool for that period, which for now is the amount budgeted for Rewards in the Long Term Algo Dynamics page. An overview of examples on how reward rates would be calculated is available in the proposal document. 

Q34: During the governance period, are the Algos committed by the Governors locked?

No. However, Governors who fail to maintain the required balance '""committed Algos"" at any point of time during the governance period will not be entitled to claim their rewards. 

Q35: When can I join the Community Governance rewards program? 

You can join at the inception period which will begin in Q4 2021.

Q36: Will Algorand Foundation receive Governance Rewards?

As the Foundation will not participate as Governors therefore the foundation will not earn/claim governance rewards.

Q37: If you grant a proxy vote to the Foundation, does that count as a participatory vote for rewards? Can you grant a proxy to someone other than the Foundation?

The Foundation will not be participating as one of the Governors but will facilitate voting. You can delegate your vote to the Algorand Foundation which will count as a vote on your behalf. You will be able to grant a proxy vote to someone other than the Foundation once the program matures. The expectation at launch would be initially a Governor if they so choose could delegate their vote to the Foundation.

Q38: Where would governance rewards come from when the 10b Algos have been distributed? Fees?

We have planned rewards until 2029. It is too soon to share how rewards will be distributed once the minted supply of 10billion Algo have been distributed.

Q39: Are there any thoughts regarding one day giving rewards to the people/entities running the Algorand Mainnet nodes? 

We are continuously evolving our plans on how to reward/incentivize running nodes but no decisions have been made as yet.

Q40: At the end of a quarter, can I choose to not receive the rewards yet? For tax purposes, the US considers staking rewards received as taxable income when they‚Äôre received, so if I wanted could I Ieave my rewards in a pool to accumulate until I chose to receive them at a later date?

Yes it is possible to delay. Rewards will sit in an escrow account following each governance period and rewards must be claimed by the Governors. Just don‚Äôt forget to claim your rewards!

Penalties:

Q41: Are there any penalties if I withdraw committed Algo from my governing account before the end of the governance period? 

Governors who withdraw Algo causing the number of Algo to drop below the committed amount of Algo at any point of time of the relevant governance period will not be entitled to claim the rewards of that governance period. 

Q42: Will the account be eligible for rewards if I deposit more Algos into the participating account during the governing period?

Yes, it will. Please see Question 23 in relation to participation requirements. Algos deposited after the beginning of a governing period, however, will not provide additional votes nor any additional rewards.

Referendum:

Q43: What is the Community Governance referendum?

The foundation will hold a formal referendum on the governance proposal, using the protocol upgrade voting mechanism on the Algorand network. Any consensus-participating Algorand address can vote in the referendum, simply by upgrading the Algorand software to a new version that we will provide, see our recent announcement here.

Q44: Will the upgrade software also include new functionality, in addition to serving as a referendum on the governance program?

Yes, we expect the upgrade software to also include some new functionality.

Q45: What will happen to this new functionality if the referendum is rejected?

If the referendum is rejected, we will supply a different upgraded software that will provide the new features but will not carry the semantics of a YES vote in the referendum. The Foundation will revisit the governance proposal with the community to understand concerns and re-work the proposal in light of that feedback.

Q46: What will happen to participation rewards if the referendum is rejected?

As stated in our announcement, participation rewards will remain at their current level through the end of 2021, and will be phased out in 2022. This will happen whether or not the governance referendum is passed.

Proposals:

Q47: Can the community suggest proposals that would be voted on by Governors?

Yes, the community will be able to bring proposals to a vote by the Governors. The details of the mechanism for doing so will be made available in the future.

Obviously that means moons are the poor mans bitcoin.   A place to talk about crypto generates tons of traffic.   Being the number 1 in that department means this subs own crypto is in it's early stages of exploding.

Obviously.  Anyone who can't see that has 1 braincell left, and they just killed that reading this.    Moons will moon.

I would start talking to your co workers about it, your boss , your clients, your mom, your dad, your aunt's, your friends, and even drug dealers. 

If none of them can see what you mean, then none of them deserve a piece of the pie. 

You see...  You where born to do this.  Those who have courage attract success. 

Need energy to do this? Go out and run, bench press iron.   If you don't have that, go out and pick up logs, or bags of dirt and start walking with it. Walk as far as you can. Who cares what people think they aren't moon believers ...right?  If you don't have legs then crawl.  Do whatever you can to tell people how much you believe in moons.

1629536311,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p8o66w/alt_coins_outperforming_btc_and_eth_indicates/,434,86,"Many of us have BTC and ETH as main stays in our portfolios, with them having proven themselves to be arguably the two most likely to return consistent long term profits. But what does it mean when alt coins and smaller projects begin to outperform them? For me, the answer is greed - we are feeling *very bullish*. That‚Äôs not a bad thing in itself, but it‚Äôs worth noting what that can mean.

Post crash, and as seen in the past primarily with BTC, the market recovery has been driven by the performance of BTC and ETH, their pumps directly correlate with the flow of the market and everything follows, they are essentially *barometers* for the market to test how bullish or bearish it‚Äôs feeling. 

However, eventually the market gains confidence, and fast, and people move from safer bets and steadier returns in BTC/ETH, and with their newfound confidence venture forth toward alt coins which begin to present as more *profitable*. 

This is where **greed** begins to set in. Green days increase confidence, more profit is desired, so the rise of alt coins vastly outperforming the big boys indicates people are well beyond fear and the market sentiment is bullish. 

There is nothing wrong with diversifying, and I personally encourage it, but be mindful during this time that throwing everything you have into alt coins in this time is not a guaranteed ‚Äòmoney goes brrrrr‚Äô scenario; invest wisely and develop plans so that you don‚Äôt fomo in. 

Because alts are pumping and people are feeling good, very good. 

TL:DR - Alt coins outperforming BTC/ETH indicates a highly bullish and possibly greedy crypto environment. Avoid fomo and maintain goals and plans to avoid overextending so that you diversify, but responsibly.",CryptoCurrency,Alt coins outperforming BTC and ETH indicates that the market is highly bullish and potentially overextending into greed - maintain your plans to diversify appropriately and avoid fomo.

Coins are digital assets that run on their own native Blockchain. Examples of this are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Polkadot.

Tokens are digital assets that are built on top of a Blockchain. For example, LINK is an ERC-20 token build on top off Ethereum.

Shares represent an ownership of a company. If Apple has 100 shares, and you own 1 share of those 100, you own 1% of Apple which makes you entitled to 1% of their Intellectual Property, Cash Reserves, Real Estate, etc.

If you have a partial ownership of Apple, you have shares. If you have 200 LINK, then you simply have 200 tokens of LINK (a.k.a Stinkies) which does not entitle you to Chainlink's profit nor Sergey's burger trips.

I thought I'd share my cautionary tale of how I fucked up to the tune of 8 thousand dollars.

I have dabbled in forex and trading CFDs before and made small profits. Day trading during volitility usually earned me a modest profit and grew my account from 2k to 4.

Then one day I found that I could trade bitcoin and bitcoin/USD on my platform. How cool! The volitility in bitcoin would surely lead to greater opportunity for profit (and unfortunately greater risk).

I started buying and shorting bitcoin on margin for modest profit. Usually jumping in and out of trades for 40 or 50 bucks and risking only 800 bucks or so at a time. It was time intensive but worked. You could usually buy a position and hold it until you made a profit or at least broke even due to the massive daily swings in value.

I found myself hedging any trades which swung too far the other way. I'd buy bitcoin and short bitcoin/USD if I was looking to lose on the previous trade. This system was risky it doubled my margin requirement but it made me money.

Then something happened. I was short Bitcoin/USD. I expected after bitcoin broke 50k there would be a market correction. I was wrong. I was an idiot.

I shorted at the blue arrow near the bottom of the candle. https://i.imgur.com/2YNXuKu.jpg
As the value rose I doubled down. Surely the fall was coming. 
It rose again. I tripled down. I was confident. I was an idiot. 

At the close of trade that day I was sitting on a loss of about 2k. I'd had a chance to pull out during some dumps for a small loss of 900 bucks. Instead I was worried that the morning would bring the usual spike in value and trigger my stop losses which would lose me about half my account. 

Here's where I made my real error. I moved my stop losses. I went against my own judgement and made a decision to risk 100 percent of my account to cover until my time came. Then at open, the price mooned. I lost not 100 percent of the account but 200 percent. I learned a valuable lesson about margin trading that day. 

I was margin called and ended up with an account value of negative 4100 dollars.

If you think that ""100 dollars can turn into 500 in the future"" rather than ""100 dollars won't give me much in terms of BTC"", you're on the right way.

I've been hearing crypto is expensive since the early 2010's. ""ONE dollar for a Bitcoin? Are you insane?"" or ""No way this TEN dollars per Bitcoin is sustainable"". Guess what: people who said this missed the boat, *but the boat that sailed at their time*! Every day a new boat departs. You do you.

While talking to a good old friend of mine, who wants to invest his pension, he told me he believes crypto is ""too expensive right now"". My first question was: expensive to whom? What amount you think is too expensive to put in? From his answers, he did not know much what he was talking about. He looked at BTC, ETH and was only seeing prices, without knowing that you can e.g. not buy a whole Bitcoin or put as little as you feel comfortable with in any coin you want. In addition, he thought the space is for get-rich-quick schemes, which clearly is not the case.

I truly understand the feeling that crypto, and in special BTC, is getting too expensive for the average folk to acquire a whole coin, but the idea of having 1 BTC has become almost as a fetish, since it can be divided in a hundred millionth of a coin and one of the final goals, if you will, is to save some buying power for your future self.

Don't think on how many Bitcoins/Satoshis/Other\_coins you can buy, think about by how much your initial investment can grow.

If you think BTC is expensive, go for other awesome projects you have out there, such as ADA, DOT, NANO, ETH (EDIT: here considering the psychological effect that owning 1+ coins feels better than owning parts of a whole, at least to some people). Do your research. Ask questions. Read a lot.

Investing in crypto is stressing sometimes, but, at least to some, it pays off.

If you can't invest much, don't worry. Invest what you can and when you can.

Be easy on yourself. Not everyone is paid in dollars or euros or pounds. Some currencies are weaker, but hey, that's not your fault! You do you.

Just be easy on yourself and remember that taking profits is not a bad idea as well. Take care of your mental and physical health. Godspeed to you all!

Pros: 

* Active development team with daily updates
* Proprietary NFT Marketplace just released
* **Currently in First place in Binance Most Valuable Builder, the winner of which get a Binance listing or direct Binance Support.** 
* Very early, low market cap that will definitely go up once they win the competition.

Cons: 

* New Project. Earnings subject to change. 
* Mobile version available but could be more user friendly
* Only on BSC

**Case Study:**

Purchased 12 Characters and a decent sword for $150 (you can start with as little as $5 if you want though) Made $1.81 per character for $21.72 per day or 7-day ROI

# Metal War - 30 Days

Pros:

* PvP and PvE modes with boss and 3D units coming soon
* Great discord and great 'customer service' -&gt; I encountered few bumps on the road and there always was someone to help me.
* Even with a single unit, you can mine shards of expensive units that you can further sell for crypto. So, it's up to you which strategy you want to develop : make an army, make some $$$.

Cons:

* Very expensive entry fee to achieve best ROI (\~$500 currently)
* Still pre-alpha and subject to change
* Repetitive:  you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat. 
* Repetitive: you just click mine and wait 1 hour to repeat (see previous point)

**Case Study:** 

Purchased on sale for $500, making $16/day playing the game. Could play more technically but that is all the time I am willing to spend on 1 game especially with lower ROI.

# R-Planet - 60 Days

Pros:

* WAX blockchain space
* No gas, just staking CPU
* Passive income. Buy a rig, make money over time

Cons:

* Price of Aether needs to be stable to earn
* If Whales sell their rigs, it will tank the resale value of the drills, making ROI harder to achieve 
* Dated and not updated nearly enough

**Case Study:** 

Played since the beginning, rigs are far less profitable now than they were when I bought them. If I purchased an equivalent rig for the current price (\~$1200) I would make \~$20 per day. This is completely passive as well. In my personal opinion, I would not do it at this time until they perform some updates.

# Conclusion

Overall, any of these will continue to grow and I am playing all of them. Not included in CryptoBlades or R-Planet are that you can sell back the NFTs you create on the marketplace for additional Return on Investment. Also with CryptoBlades, the Character NFTs level up as you use them and many of them are going for $100 when they were purchased for $5 just 2 weeks ago.

The fees seem to be very low, and the exchange rates seem to be fair.  

I really like this approach because it reduces the cost and time I spend, and it also immediately places the coins in my own wallet, so they aren't sitting on an exchange.

Just as an example, here's how I bought Nano using Swapswop:

 Step 1) Buy XLM on Coinbase or some other site that you are comfortable with.

Step 2) Go to [swapswop.io](https://swapswop.io/) and where it shows BTC in red, click it and select XLM (or if you are sending a different crypto to Swapswop then select that crypto)

Step 3) Type in the total number of XLM (or other crypto) that you will be sending to Swapswop (make sure you have the minimum required, which is roughly 32 XLM)

Step 4) Select Nano where it says ETH in blue (or a different crypto if you want to buy a different one)

Step 5) Click on Exchange

Step 6) Enter the Nano address for your wallet (as always, double check that you copy and paste correctly)

Step 7) Click Exchange

Step 8) Copy and paste the XLM wallet address as well as the XLM Memo line into your wallet you are sending from. So, if you are using Coinbase, choose to send your XLM and add in the XLM address shown on Swapswop and then add the XLM Memo information. Be sure to add the memo data! If not, you will lose your XLM and not receive any Nano in your wallet.

Step 9) Send XLM from your wallet to the Swapswop address, then just wait a few minutes and it should show up in your Nano wallet.

TL;DR To avoid transaction fees, I used XLM to buy Nano.  I sent the XLM from Coinbase to Swapswop, and then received Nano in my personal wallet a few minutes later.  

Hope it helps someone else as much at it helped me!",CryptoCurrency,"LPT: If you are looking to buy coins that are not found on Coinbase or other major exchanges (Nano, VeChain, Secret, etc), try using Swapswop.io"
