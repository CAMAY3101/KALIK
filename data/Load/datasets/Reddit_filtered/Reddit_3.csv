As someone who has been invested in Fantom since early 2019, I will explain below what makes me excited about the project. This is not financial advice and, of course, DYOR.*

[Fantom](https://fantom.foundation) is a layer 1 smart contract platform that has recently received a lot more attention, with an astronomical rise of 14x in the last month.

**Why? Read below.**

Fantom is fast and cheap. Fantom confirms transactions in less than 2 seconds, and they cost a fraction of a cent, or $0.00001. 

**Andre Cronje built it**

[Andre Cronje](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech), the genius developer behind [Yearn](https://yearn.finance) and many other DeFi products, coauthored the consensus algorithm of Fantom, called Lachesis. He’s still involved in the project and speaks to the team daily, overseeing the major updates and releases.

Moreover, he confirmed multiple times that when the bridges are ready, he will port his most popular dApps on Fantom since it’s faster and cheaper than Ethereum.

Even better, the other [he tweeted about what that will look like from a user experience standpoint.](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1362263811386839043?s=19) Holy fuckballs this will be awesome.

**Fantom isn’t an Ethereum fork**

Unlike many other blockchains, Fantom is not a fork of Ethereum. It’s built from scratch using an innovative consensus algorithm designed for high performance and scalability.

**Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum**

Fantom supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

What does it mean? Developers familiar with Ethereum can deploy their dApps on Fantom just as easily, using the same tools such as Truffle, Remix, and Metamask.

Their dApps will be much cheaper to deploy, maintain and interact with. The user experience is therefore drastically improved, also thanks to the almost instant confirmations.

**Fantom is interoperable**

The full Ethereum compatibility makes Fantom interoperable with Ethereum. Ren is building a bridge between the two networks to allow a seamless flow of assets back and forth. 

Fantom is a layer 1 platform that can serve as a layer 2 for Ethereum. In other words, it can help Ethereum scale, among many other things. 

Just the other day Andre [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1363983480674115584) that FTM was never meant to be an ETH killer, but ETH simply needs some load balancers to help out. What FTM is doing for ETH is going to be huge. 

**You can stake it to earn rewards** 

Fantom is a Proof-of-Stake network. It means that you can participate in securing the network by staking your FTM. But it doesn’t end there. You can choose for how long to lock up your tokens for and get rewarded accordingly; the longer you lock your FTM, the higher the rewards.
Furthermore, Fantom is the first network to introduce Liquid Staking. You can use the value of your staked FTM within the ecosystem. Massive. 

There is also a governance system where holders can vote on the changes of the protocol.

*Humble brag: I've been staking for almost 2 years and have earned over 100K FTM passively.*

**It has an all-in-one DeFi suite**

The team didn’t just build an incredible blockchain platform that is fast, scalable, and secure. They also created an all-in-one DeFi suite, [Fantom Finance](https://fantom.finance). DeFi users are used to jumping across different protocols and websites to trade, lend, borrow and farm. Fantom Finance solves all that.

Users can mint synthetic tokens (like on Synthetix), trade on an AMM dex (like on Uniswap), and borrow and lend tokens (like on Aave), all in one place, directly from the wallet. How cool is that?!

**It has already partnered with many recognized crypto projects**

Fantom partnered with:

-Chainlink

-Ren Protocol

-Band Protocol

-Injective Protocol

-Waves

-The Graph

-Ethereum Classic Labs

-Api3

-Ontology

-V-id

-Coti

And many more

**It is still undervalued in my opinion**

Fantom is sitting around a $2 billion market cap with a token price of $0.78. Despite its recent rise, Fantom is still vastly undervalued. Avalanche offers a similar tech, without the integrated DeFi suite, and it’s valued higher at $2.4b. Solana, a fast blockchain yet not compatible with EVM and slower than Fantom, is above $4b. Aave, a dApp on Ethereum that would represent a part of Fantom Finance (so a part of a dApp on the Fantom ecosystem), is valued just under $5b. The proper comparison should be made with Ethereum, valued at $188b. In my opinion, the potential growth for Fantom is another 3x in the short term and the sky is the limit long term.

**It has a passionate community and strong social presence**

The Fantom Marines are one of the best communities in crypto. They’re organized like a proper army. They’re knowledgeable, and their Twitter presence is a force of nature. They’re similar to the Link Marines. They act as one. Memes, articles, videos, gifs, you name it. They can do it all.

**It has multiple government pilot programs and partnerships**

If you're still with me, you made it to one of the most exciting parts. 

Fantom is reshaping the country of Afghanistan. They have not one, not two, not three, but **four** government live pilot programs with Afghanistan. The first one, launched in July 2020 with the Minister of Health of Afghanistan, leverages [blockchain technology for pharmaceutical supply chain tracking](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-blockchain-launch-smart-medicine-103000039.html) to combat counterfeit drugs. More recently, Fantom [partnered with DABS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fantom-launches-blockchain-pilot-afghanistan-100000458.html), the national energy company for Afghanistan, to build blockchain-based ERP and CRM systems. Another program involves [the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce and Investment to implement blockchain tools for auditing and authentication purposes.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/acci-fantom-pilot-program/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=fc807837d997e590f21b20adb6972d65aa0369a9-1613695821-0-AQmeswbGk2HLX3Q8Q-7BSdgfFzEERILHjQwfIjI_4ThPyuotouz1gTAB1GkQzXnc37yf8Upy1dcT-QIq2o-DC_A8AqWg1bTnzpKA4fid5uMuF10xwOYNkEIbjtd3p8kWz_1jQKPJbaWuUqNeS5THXMsFuxLq4maJeXz0IRIujOIzYz9L_rv7j-aFwmhnYzSFGP57JC49WQTTmbc6Gk0Gl4aAcYqsb3zTtsEpKB_lWtDXZvCdOZXGFcv0BwfNKokJVb90SwSkYdILQjkYAwvTU-No_anIiZ9bvXnIu6dBM4MPZGIoV2NItRtwyQpcZcB6dIww7_VDu2T6_8jvO_iwiQUBKk2KotrDKTDtDuOz6DWU) The team aims to digitize the whole country of Afghanistan and ultimately build a national stock exchange on the Fantom blockchain. The latest pilot program is [with The Afghanistan National Standard Authority to use Fantom technology to issue national certifications.](https://fantom.foundation/blog/ansa-fantom-blockchain-issuance-program/) 

Also the announcement was very recently made that [The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine has signed a memorandum which provides for cooperation in creating a platform for the exchange of intellectual property based on the Fantom blockchain](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayinska-delegaciya-pid-golovuvannyam-volodimira-zelenskog-66549)

**It has a transparent and humble team**

The Fantom team is very transparent and humble. They communicate promptly - they have one of the most active [Twitter accounts in crypto](https://twitter.com/FantomFDN), they’re hard-working and as clear as they can be with the community. It almost feels like the team is part of the community. Besides their [official chat on Discord](https://chat.fantom.network), they also offer a support chat on their website, unheard of in crypto. Their Github is updated frequently, almost daily, and it’s easy to see what they’re working on at any given time.

**It’s getting integrated everywhere**

Besides centralized exchanges like Binance, Fantom is taking over the DeFi space. It’s listed on Uniswap, Sushiswap and 1inch. Just this week, Binance integrated FTM Opera Chain for deposits &amp; withdrawals. It’s just the beginning. We can speculate that once the Ren bridges are in place, there will be more integrations on Ethereum. We can think of Yearn, Curve, and all the biggest DeFi money markets.

**It’s on Coinbase Custody**

Coinbase Custody is the most important crypto custodian in the world and [it supports Fantom](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto/status/1354563754713903110). Institutions and funds can now safely store their FTM with a trusted third party. It’s the first step to getting listed to Coinbase.

**Etherscan has built an explorer for them**

The Etherscan team has recently built [FTMScan](https://ftmscan.com), an explorer for Fantom. Previously, they only made Etherscan and an explorer for Binance. If that doesn’t tell you something, my friend, it’s on you.

And there you have it. I hope this helps paint a picture of why FTM has been shooting up the rankings. I still think there is a lot to come, but again, this is not financial advice. Good luck to all!",CryptoCurrency,I've seen a lot of people on here recently asking what Fantom is and why it's taking off. I hope this helps.

1614325787,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lssskt/dont_leverage_trade_please/,505,425,"So.. I'm a bit embarrased to write this, but if it prevents a single person from not losing money, it's worth it. Here goes.

I'm a student who had a bit of spare money which just kept sitting and depreciating on my savings account. I don't really need that money and it isn't anything lifechanging (I couldn't even buy a car with it), so I decided to go all-in in crypto. I picked DOT for sensible risk-reward ratio. Things have been going great, when DOT peaked I doubled my money. I wanted to sell something to buy a new laptop at that point but my DOT was locked in staking and, more impornantly, I had a huge exam coming.

When things were crashing for a few days I finally decided to unstake a third of my holdings - unstaking period on Binance is 2 days, my 60 DOTs arrived yesterday. After I passed (hooray!) the exam, I was really exctasic, and so was crypto, for that matter. I was convinced BTC was now safely above 50K USD. I hade prior experience with leverage trading, It always went like this: **made money -&gt; got greedy -&gt; increased leverage -&gt; lost everything.** Total amount lost is like 150 USD - so nothing terrible - but my potential profits (if a pulled the trigger) were in 1-2K USD area. That sucked but at least it wasn't my money.

I didn't really like the idea of selling my DOT as I truly believe in it's future - but i found something called futures. Didn't realy understand it but aparantelly there is also a possibility to leverage trade with your tokens (instead of USD) as collateral. That sounded great, were finally recovering from the crash to 45K USD, why not make a bit of extra money?

I started with 3x leverage, nothing crazy and plenty of cushioning if shit hits the fan. In a few hours I made profit made a profit of 10 DOT or 340 USD - that's crazy, I'm from Europe and this is more than I made at my part time job for all of February! I was really pleased with myself, I passed the exam, my girlfriend came over and now this.

This all happened after 4 sleepless nights, I was really nervous about that exam and couldn't sleep. Finally, I decided to go in bed - and my stupid ass opened another leveraged trade, after all, BTC was now stable, right? I woke up 9 hours later, BTC meanwhile dropped from 51 do 47K and my long trade lost value from 70 DOTs to 30. I could have swalloved it and cut my losses but I didn't, of course.

In the next few hours I opened and closed many long/short trades with increesing leverage, just trying to save what lost. That didn't work. It never works - especially when greed and panic takes over. During the course of writing my post a lost last 12 DOT on overleveraged trade in the final attempt to break even. I didn't even care about it - despite 12 DOT being more than I make in a month.

I'm feeling like shit right now, called my girlfriend who is really awesome and managed to improve my mood a bit. Also I still have 2/3 of my DOT holdings, I'm not in a loss - but my P/L is really close to 0 now. Decided to withdraw the rest from staking and will concider selling some of it if the market rises again. That said, I can't imagine how this possible feels when you loose your family savings or even take a loan to trade crypto.

I guess the bottom line is this: **Don't be greedy**. It's not that hard to make more money out of it but you get in a never ending downvard spiral - always wanting more, more, more... Also, there are more important things in life than money - one of them is mental health. If you get severely depressed as a result of investing in crypto, it isn't worth it. I don't care what you say, it just isnt.

I'm sorry for a chaotic post but I really wanted to get it out of my self. Leverage trading is shit. Market will recover, your losses won't. Please, spread the FUD about leverage trading, I'm going to go for a walk now. Also, I'm sure there are far worse stories than mine - I'd be happy to hear them if you got over it and want to further encourage people not to do this.

Stay strong.

1614798922,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lx1w6t/im_starting_to_think_pos_ethereum_might_be_better/,230,64,"First of all, downvotes instead of explanations prove that I am right (yes, I just came from r/bitcoin). 

So as the title says, I've been doing some reading into Ethereum and comparing what I'm learning to what I know about Bitcoin.  I will admit I don't have a programmer's understanding of crypto (my knowledge comes from books [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Gold-Bitcoin-Millionaires-Reinvent/dp/006236250X) and articles [like this](https://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/)).  

But this proof of stake (and honestly, all of Ethereum 2.0) sounds really powerful.

So this is what I understand about bitcoin.  You have a spreadsheet of ""coins"" called the blockchain spread out among tons of different computers.  If I want to send a bitcoin to someone else, I sign a transaction with a private key (which is basically what my wallet is) and broadcast that transaction to the miners.

The miners, when they receive my broadcast, can signal that my transaction is valid.  But they can only signal that my transaction is valid if they first solve a cryptographic puzzle called proof of work.  It is only when 51% of miners signal that my transaction is valid that the blockchain is updated to reflect my transaction (hence, to double spend, you need 51% of all computing power solving the proof of work).

But here's the thing.  The primary thing proof of work does is to make it costly to validate transactions and thus make taking over the network too costly.  But it is not **logically necessary** that proof of work require solving a cryptographic puzzle.  To give an absurd example, in an alternate universe, proof of work could be making the miners lift rocks, and if you life enough rocks then you can signal that the transaction is valid.  An attacker would have to lift 51% of all rocks in the network in order to attack the system.  And if the system was big enough, well, that would be lots of rocks!  

The big idea, the **insight**, behind proof of stake, is that it's arbitrary to link solving a cryptographic puzzle to network validation.  Anything can be linked to network validation as long as it makes validation costly.

In proof of stake, if 51% of staked ethereum signals a transaction is valid, the transaction goes through.  To get 51% of the ethereum needed to take over the network, you need to put in the work to accumulate and hold 51% of all staked capital in order to hack the network.

So in staking, what substitutes for the energy used in mining is something more abstract, namely, social consensus.  Human beings buy and sell ethereum for energy in different forms, namely, money and goods (and also for use in smart contracts).   Also, holding ethereum requires work and energy because there are opportunity costs associated with this hodling.  

So to 51% attack Ethereum, you would need to do all the work necessary to convince the Ethereum community to hand over their representations of work and energy.  This is much more abstract work than solving a cryptographic puzzle.  **BUT.... as long as it makes validation difficult and costly, then it doesn't matter, it's no different than proof of work.**  As I said, the key insight is that solving cryptographic puzzles for proof of work is arbitrary.

I also don't buy the arguments that Proof of Stake would lead to an oligarchy.  It seems like it would be easier to stake Ethereum than to mine bitcoin, which is better for small hodlers.  And in addition, the currently staked Ethereum seems highly diversified, so there is a real life counterpoint to those arguments.

Alright, this post is too long already, but if Ethereum 2.0 works, then it would seem be a better store of value than bitcoin.  Unlike bitcoin, you would actually get paid to hold Ethereum.  Unlike bitcoin, there would be no halvings, which means the price of Ethereum would not fluctuate wildly.  And Ethereum would have a lower inflation rate than Bitcoin after Ethereum 1.5 comes out.  On top of this, we would not have to worry about lack of miner rewards destabilizing the network in several decades.  These are all huge advantages and that's on top of scalability.  

Alright, that's my case for Ethereum 2.0.  Where am I wrong?",CryptoCurrency,I'm starting to think PoS (Ethereum) might be better than PoW (Bitcoin). Talk me out of it.

Until now I've thinking influencers own a bag of their 'favorite' crypto that is according to them the next big thing with brand new tech or maybe just a shitcoin that would moon so they could shill and pump their bags up. But most of them don't own any and just ""advertise"" them.

Don't fall for these ""advertisements""

1638887086,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rb0b5c/a_brief_history_of_banano_a_coin_seemingly/,110,82,"Direct quote from the first shitposter Reddit User Anemonean

“I can give some history.

It was a cold and dreary February. February 2018 to be exact. Nano had just been rekt by one of its two major exchanges, Bitgrail, which was hacked and shut down (at the time only 2 exchanges listed Raiblocks which had recently been rebranded to Nano) . Nano's price went in the dumpster, many people lost everything regardless of the price. Around the same time the 2018 bear market had just started after a major crash in January, the whole market was a sea of red.

Many users who had lost it all in Bitgrail took to the Nano discord to figure out what was going on and to commiserate with fellow rekt users. I was one of those users.

But then something started to happen. Instead of wallowing in sadness many users started to make memes to process their grief... and other users started to tip them Nano for their effort. Nano tips flowed like water in those days, and I found that by making memes I could slowly rebuild the Nano I had lost. It was that culture of humor and giving in the face of being completely and totally rekt that the banano usecase began to nebulously form.

A few weeks later I made a meme that imagined a fake meme currency named Banano. I spent abt 5 minutes drawing up a logo (two bananas 69ing into the shape of a Nano ""N"") and came up with a couple punchy slogans like ""Not a shitcoin until digested."" It received a positive reaction from the community.

A few days later a fellow user from the Discord, Ceefs (chocolatefudcake), got in touch with me asking where the meme came from and If I had made it. I said yes. Ceefs told me they were toying around with the idea of forking Nano with another user, RQ, who had built a bunch of Nano tools and asked if I'd be down to let them use the name and logo for their freshly minted forked coins. Ceefs had apparently asked RQ if he knew how to fork nano and RQ had jokingly asked him ""are you about to make Banano?"" Anyway, They seemed pretty serious and understood the protocol in a way that was mind boggling to me- so I said sure, the logo is all yours, and what's more, I'll be your ""chief shitposting officer"". Ceefs and RQ did the work of forking, copying Nano's open source code on GitHub, changing max supply to be higher, lowering proof of work threshold slightly, changing prefixes to Ban and a bunch of other small changes that would make the coin unique but close enough to the source code to easily allow adding future nano updates to our own network. We deployed that code on our own nodes and the network was born

Within a few weeks we were successfully running a testnet and making the earliest memes. We got a small group of nano users to come test it out. By April of 2018 we felt sufficiently ready to switch to mainnet and we announced the birth of the coin on April 1st 2018 (Reverse April fools).

The rest, as they say, is history. Various people joined the team and committed their skills and talents to the community, 2 users built Kalium from the ground up(later forked to Natrium to give back to nano) and designed the MonKeys, in a fit of creative genius we set up the website banano.co.in which would eventually be replaced by banano.cc and gave it the classic particles.js background that every shitcoin uses. One user came up with a novel game distribution method called Banano Runner which ran during those early months. Another pioneered early ledger integrations. Between artists and programmers and shitposters we had built the core of what is the banano community today.

From the very start we tried to foster that same tipping culture we had seen back on the Nano discord in those weeks after the Bitgrail hack. Microtipping for meme content seemed an appropriate usecase for a feeless and instant coin and we wanted that culture of generosity to define our coin. During those days when every shitcoin was doing an ICO we thought it would be ironic to do the opposite, give it away for free. Irony was always very important to us, the subversion of expectation is the ultimate shitpost. So while we were a ""shitcoin"" and referred to ourselves as such we wanted to have the best possible wallet experience we could create, to rival these billion dollar projects. And we wanted to buck the trends of the crypto space, giving rather than lambos, free distribution rather than ICOs.

And don't get me wrong we WERE a shitcoin back in those days, hell we still are now. The whole distribution process has been pretty centralized. But because of that centralized process, and because we weren't afraid to be called a shitcoin it allowed us to be super creative about the ways we could distribute the coin. By not being beholden to serious investors we were more free to create a coin that wasn't just about generating value but was about building community.

3 years on id say it's mission success so far. Very excited to see how far we can go. I don't want to take the credit though, nor do I think anyone on the team could have made banano what it is today alone. Banano is what it is today because of the community that grew around it, from the lowliest shitposters to the artists, the shills, the whales, the community devs and faucetmasters, everyone has an equal stake in Banano's ongoing success.”

This is posted in **30 Jun 2017**. They were in the middle of bull run and this guy is angry that the sub only talk about price action. Which I feel the same thing happening now.

He mentioned coin with good tech like Ardor, Ubiq, and NEM. Let's see where they are now:

||Price at the time|Price now|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ardor|0.224 (peaked at 2.04 on 15 Jan 2018)|0.278 (+24%)|
|Ubiq|1.56 (peaked at 6.82 on 03 Jan 2018)|0.197 **(-87%)**|
|NEM|0.16 (peaked at 1.79 on 03 Jan 2018)|0.1383 **(-13%)**|

Ardor and NEM actually perform well if you bought at Jun 2017. But I'm guessing a lot more people are buying in December to January.

# Conclusion

With the data shown above, we need to remind everyone again that **we don't know shit about fuck**.

Don't solely use this sub to find out what altcoin you should buy. Cross check from various sources!

**Build your conviction**. If your conviction is strong, you will keep buying that coin even when it dipped hard.

**How to build conviction?** You need to fully understand what your coin does.

Not a financial advice.

# Extra Fun Fact

Long story short: No!

If a crypto appears cheap like ADA / cardano at $1.5 check it’s market capitalization (calculated by multiplying the volume of coins with the price). In this example ADA has a market cap of $50 billion. This means that for its price to double and go to $3 an addition $50 billion has to be invested!

Put differently if people invested an addition $700 billion in Ada now it’s maker cap would be the same as the market cap of Bitcoin and ADA would be worth only $22,5! Nowhere near the current price of Bitcoin at $40,000! This is due to massive differences in volume of coins between Bitcoin and ADA.

A good exercise would be to calculate the market capitalization of Doge and compare it to the one of Bitcoin if Doge was worth $40,000.

So please be careful when buying “cheap” coins, check the volume and market capitalization.

Edit: as rightfully pointed out in some comments my example is over simplified as coin volumes are not all necessarily made available for purchase or listed on exchanges and that is also the case for ADA. However it is still important to look at price Vs volume and market cap.",CryptoCurrency,If you think a cryptocurrency is “cheap” because of its price check the market capitalization.

Hi all! For those who didn't see the post yesterday (not a lot did!) I have been compiling a list of terms that are used in crypto with some basic explanations of what they are. The purpose of this is to have a way to explain the terminology without scaring people off. I've watched many people try to explain crypto in real life to have the recipient start to gloss over - usually right around when the word blockchain, or decentralized, or mining for hashes come up.

I've copied the list so far below. Please comment a few things.

1. Is this worth updating and continuing (I'm happy to do so!)
2. Are there any explanations you could provide feedback on so that they could be better, more accurate or easier to understand
3. Would you see value in a website being hosted to promote some of these ideas to help with newcomers to the space? I'd be happy to purchase and maintain said website (no donations or anything needed, just happy to do it).

thanks for checking it out

For the definitions that start with an asterisk (\*), they are not complete and may not be included going forward. In fact, a few of these may not make the cut as I tried to avoid words that had a negative connotation, and also any terms that may make people question the legitimacy of cryptocurrency in general.

# Cryptocurrency - what is it?

Cryptocurrency is a currency similar to any other that you have used or heard of.  Quite simply put; it’s a value associated with a digital coin, or token.  When you purchase cryptocurrency \[crypto\], you have purchased the ownership of a token that exists on the ‘blockchain’.  This will be associated with your digital wallet until you sell your token, purchase an item using your token, trade for another token or move to a different digital wallet.

# Blockchain

Blockchain is a ledger or record of all the transactions that have taken place with the crypto that it is associated with.  For example, if you purchased Bitcoin, then you would own the digital token at a particular location on the blockchain.  This transaction (the purchase of coin, and storage of said coin in your wallet) would be recorded at a particular point on the blockchain that would remain forever associated with the transaction forever.  A blockchain does not erase transactions when there are sales, transfers, or usage of tokens.  The blockchain stores that information and blockchain ‘workers’ validate that transaction indefinitely.  This validation of transactions is what makes the blockchain secure and cryptocurrency extraordinarily safe from malicious attempts to gain control of your cryptocurrency.

If you have ever kept track of your own purchases either through an accounting software, or even balancing a chequebook, this is similar to how blockchain works.  It records each transaction and when a new transaction takes place, the original ‘block’ will then point to the new block with an updated balance.

Because the blockchain is not stored in a central location (think: bank), it is decentralized.  This is a very common word and explanation in the digital world.  Decentralization shifts control away from one single person or company and gives that control to the people who own the cryptocurrency.  Because the currency is decentralized, it is less susceptible to manipulation from a higher level (government, corporations, etc).

# Wallets

As mentioned, cryptocurrency is stored on the blockchain. The wallet will hold the keys (or reference) to the coin and that is then associated with your wallet. A wallet is something that you will download to your computer (or store on a digital exchange), and like any wallet, you can look at it to see how much crypto you own.  It is important to note that you can not see all of the different types of cryptocurrency in one wallet.  You will need to get the wallet that matches the currency you have purchased, or are going to purchase.

A comparison to traditional money is your debit card.  You have a debit card that has money associated with it, but that money is stored in the bank and referenced to your account number.  When you log on to your online banking, you see a balance that is associated with your account and debit card when you want to spend it.  Although blockchain, crypto, wallets, and keys sound a little more daunting; it’s very similar to what you have already experienced with a debit card.

If you wanted to purchase Bitcoin, you would go to the official Bitcoin site and choose the wallet that best suit your needs.  Wallets will typically have light versions and regular versions. Don’t be surprised if you download a wallet and it takes a day or two to ‘sync to the network’.  What’s happening here is that you are downloading every single transaction that has ever happened with the cryptocurrency and storing the ledger (records) on your computer.  This can sound like a scary thing for sure, but you’re actually becoming part of the secure network as mentioned before.  Because you have all the transactions, and everyone else has all the transactions this is what makes the blockchain secure.  To change the records at a particular point in time, you would have to change the records on every single computer hosting that wallet, at the same time.

A light wallet gives you the ability to store the information at the current time for your own records.  It does not download all of the transactions in history to the computer.  It’s faster to get going on your own computer, which is always nice!

A third option is using a digital exchange and letting this exchange host your wallet.  This is explained below with some other details about exchanges.

# Digital Exchange

A digital exchange is a place where you go to purchase cryptocurrency.  Depending on the value of what you would like to purchase, you *should* need to register yourself, using government ID (this depends on the regulations in your country) and answering a set of questions to validate who you are.  Picking the right exchange is very important.  An exchange that requires no information from you to proceed might sound good, but it might also be a low-budget operation that is susceptible to fraud, malicious intrusions or other issues where you might end up losing your cryptocurrency and any investment that you may have on the website.

Before you sign up with an exchange, you will need to do some research for your particular area and see what has a good reputation, proper security measures in place and also the ability to buy/sell the cryptocurrency that you are most interested in.  If you want to buy Bitcoin, just about any exchange will service this.  If you wanted to buy another coin like Dogecoin for example, not all exchanges offer this ability.  There are usually ways to figure this out by purchasing a currency that is available and then trading for another currency (purchase Bitcoin, then trade that for dogecoin either on the same website, or transfer to another website) but this can be subject to exchange fees which you will want to research in the first place.

If this sounds daunting or complicated, it’s best to think of it just like exchanging for another currency when travelling.  I personally live in Canada and when I vacation in Florida, Mexico or Cuba, I always change my Canadian dollars to US Dollars.  I either go into the bank and do this, or visit an exchange booth in the mall or airport.  Then I get my exchange done and enjoy my vacation.  Sometimes on vacation, I’ll end up with local currency which I exchange while on vacation to USD and then when I return home I can either exchange back to CAD, or leave in USD for the next vacation.  That’s not too dissimilar to cryptocurrency exchanges.  I can leave in one currency or exchange to another depending on what my goals are.

At this point, you’re best to establish what your goals are before you start purchasing and exchanging back and forth.  This is when transaction fees or exchange fees can start to add up.

# Transaction Fees

As mentioned above, there are transaction fees on digital exchanges, just like if you were moving money in a traditional bank.  It would be impossible to cover specifics as each exchange will have a different setup for their transactions, but this is something that you will want to be aware of and make sure that you have factored into your own calculations as you start to invest into cryptocurrency. 

At the time of writing, I pay a 2% transaction fee on my exchange.  Because of this, I try to do less trading and more investing.  I don’t want to be paying that fee continually as it will eat away at my investment.

# Security

The safety and security of the blockchain and cryptocurrency in general is extraordinarily high.  Because of the things that we have already listed above with the blockchain and how it is constantly validated by a large number of sources, we can be confident that the transactions are secure, next to impossible to ‘fake’ and we are able to confidently store our cryptocurrency without worry of attempts to steal our funds.  Like all things in life; you are only as strong as your weakest link.

This is where the onus falls upon us as the users to protect our own information.  You may have heard of people being scammed for their digital currencies in the past; perhaps their computer was hacked, or something else happened where they lost their investment.  This is a possibility, just like it would be if I didn’t have a strong password for my online bank.  If I were to write down my password for online banking and someone was to see it, I could have a problem.  If I were to install a program on my computer that had a virus, I could be open to a malicious attack for my online banking as well.  Just like with traditional banking, you must secure your computer and your funds to take care of your end of the crypto transaction.

From what we have talked about already, downloading the digital wallet is an area that could leave some people open to issues.  It is extremely important that you don’t download a wallet that was sent to you by someone on the internet.  Always download the wallet from the proper source, whether that be the official site for the cryptocurrency you are thinking of purchasing (bitcoin.org if you wanted Bitcoin, for example) or another trusted website such as Github.  You will want to ensure you have an Antivirus program running on your computer, and it’s up to date.  Again, if this sounds scary, this is what you should already be doing considering the amount of information that’s typically running through our computers from online banking to personal EMails, to working from home.

One basic piece of security that I would suggest for cryptocurrency is installing the official wallet for whatever currency you hold, and then sending that currency from the exchange where you have purchased it to yourself.  Store this on your  personal computer and make sure that you are secure (good password, antivirus, etc).  

# What is “mining”?

First, we will want to think of mining in the traditional sense.  Someone (typically) with a large machine is boring through the earth looking for minerals.  This machine will do a great deal of work, pushing away rock and sediment to find the ore, gem, or whatever it has been tasked to find.  A group of miners uncover earth that carried ancient waters and pushed gold sediment into pockets.  They sort and sift that earth through large machines to find gold deposits.  Tiny little specks of gold that after some processing become large nuggets or bars of gold that are then sold into the open market and eventually processed to become pieces of jewelry for purchase by the end user.

Mining a cryptocurrency is not too dissimilar from the explanation above.  This process is how new ‘blocks’ of information are created or discovered for the blockchain.  These blocks are then tied into a value of the cryptocurrency that is being mined (a Bitcoin, for example) and this new bitcoin becomes part of the ledger and records that are associated with all of the pieces of bitcoin available to the world.

But what is the machine mining?  The computers that are mining for cryptocurrency are solving complex math problems.  These problems get increasingly more difficult to solve as the cryptocurrency gets older, which helps regulate supply as new coins or tokens are created.  But what are the computers solving?  For us; they aren’t solving anything of value.  The computers aren’t solving specific problems (i.e. a cure for a disease or an equation for automated investing!)  but rather just incredibly difficult equations that are designed to make the computer work to get a solution.  Although there is a lot more to what the computers are trying to solve in order to unlock a new block, we will leave this definition as is.  In a future document, we can cover this in more detail as to what the computers are trying to solve (or in fact, guess).

As you can imagine, a large amount of computational power is being used to solve these problems in order to release a new coin onto the blockchain.  This is one of the areas of concern with cryptocurrency; so much energy use and for what purpose?

Once the block is solved however, the coin is released to the computer, or team of computers, who solved the hash problem and then that coin is stored in a digital wallet, or sold on a cryptocurrency exchange for profit. 

The above example of mining is what is called “Proof of Work”, but as discussed below, this is not the only way to mine a cryptocurrency.  There are three other types (Proof of Stake, Delegated Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority), the most popular are covered below (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake)

# Proof of Work (PoW)

Essentially, proof of work is when a computer or group of computers work together to solve an equation to unlock a new piece of the blockchain.  Bitcoin uses proof of work to validate transactions, create new coins and continue to grow as a currency.  Proof of work is considered to be a high consumer of energy and has been in the news for some time regarding this.  As more miners join the network, the energy use continues to grow.

When computers solve a complex mathematical equation (or riddle!) this is considered proof of work.  “I solved your puzzle, here is my proof!”.

# Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of stake is a practice where mining happens not just by solving huge computational problems using powerful computers, but rather where mining or validation takes place based on how many digital coins you hold.  The more coins you have to use for mining, the more power you have.  Because of this, PoS mining is typically done in pools.  Similar to PoW, there is mining and hashing involved, but instead of being able to purchase more and more hardware, drawing more and more energy, users ‘stake’ their own cryptocurrency to mine new blocks.  Again, this is typically done in a pool to provide more changes of unlocking the block and therefore receiving a share of the newly created currency.

PoS is extremely secure.  Staking your coins is also practically risk-free with reputable coins and servers as you still maintain full control of your coins in whatever wallet you are using (you can stake coins on an exchange, or even from a wallet stored on your personal computer).  Because you would need to increase your share of the cryptocurrency in order to increase your chances of winning the next block, there is a lot less chance of someone trying to manipulate or ‘cheat’ their way to new coins/tokens.  If someone were to try and break the system, they would devalue all of their own coins in the process.

# Mining pools

A mining pool is a group of computers who have joined together to increase their computing power and therefore increase their chances of solving a block through hashing.  Mining combines the power of all computers, increasing the speed at which the hashes are created in an effort to solve the hash (string of information) to unlock the next block.  When successful, the cryptocurrency is distributed throughout all the participants in the mining pool.

As a single miner it will either be very costly to get enough hardware to put together a system that generates a high enough hash rate (speed) to have a good chance of solving a hash and getting a reward (cryptocurrency payment).  This simply means that solo-mining has a low chance of getting any reward.  You could try to solve the hash for years without reward.  Joining a pool let’s the average user utilize their existing processing power (it’s still recommended to have a good graphics card) and increase the chance of receiving at least something for their efforts.

# What is “staking”?

Staking is a very interesting part of cryptocurrency that helps solve some of the challenges around power consumption through Proof of Work systems.  To stake your crypto, you would be holding a Proof of Stake coin and therefore, you could join a staking group to try and unlock the next reward on the blockchain.

Staking is defined as the act of ‘locking’ up your coins to help validate the network (blockchain) and in turn, keep the network secure.  There is little to no risk while staking (no risk when you are using a legitimate coin and software that was downloaded from a reputable site as mentioned before).  Although it sounds like you are giving your coin to someone else to use as a proof of stake, you maintain full control of your coins during this process.  That said, if you use an online wallet, then you are at risk if the exchange site has a data breach.  With many coins however, you can stake directly from the wallet on your personal computer.

When we discussed Proof of Work, the chances of solving or unlocking the next block were increased by the sheer amount of processing power you were dedicating to solving the hash.  In Proof of Stake, the blockchain assigns a particular coin the ability to unlock the next hash.  The person with the correct coin gets to unlock the reward.  The more coins you have staked, the greater your chances of being selected.  So, joining a staking pool is the best way to increase your chances of winning.

Have you ever played the lottery?  A number will be chosen to win the lottery at each drawing.  If you have one ticket, you have a low chance of holding the correct numbers.  If you have 1000 tickets, you have a better chance.  This is the same as staking your coins and trying to win the right to unlock the next reward.

# *Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are a very interesting part of cryptocurrency’s development over time.  They have been available at least back to the early days of Bitcoin, but they have been more popular (or simply discussed more) in recent years.  A smart contract is an agreement between two parties to do a particular thing when conditions are met.  In basic computer speak it’s like saying “if this happens, then you need to do that”.

One basic (and very useful) function of a smart contract is that they are immutable.  This basically means that they can not be changed.  If you enter an agreement with someone with a particular arrangement, it is not subject to change.  You will get what you agreed upon.

One basic (and very practical) example of a smart contract would be a retail transaction.  If someone agrees to purchase a product from you, a smart contract can be set in place to pay the seller upon receipt of the product.  Another example would be if you had agreed to pay someone $500 / week for work complete, you could have a smart contract set to pay the employee at a specific interval of time.

# How many cryptocurrencies are there?

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence. One count in early 2021 put that number at over 5,000.  This is one thing to remember while looking at the different currencies and thinking about which ones you might want to purchase, or research.  You can research the different coins on popular sites with  \[reddit\] , or you can find a listing of the top currencies at \[coinmarketcap\]

# How do I know the price at any given time?

For general information, you can use a site like \[coinmarketcap\] to see the most popular and most valuable cryptocurrencies.  You will be able to see prices for all coins listed here.  One thing to remember is that you may not be able to actually purchase all of the coins listed here.  It would be important to remember to check your cryptocurrency exchange of choice to figure out which coins are available to you, and how much they are at any given time.  For example, if you were to use \[binance\]  as your exchange, then you would be able to purchase any of the coins listed on the site, and therefore you would be able to find the most recent prices on the market listing or trade execution screen.

# How do I sell cryptocurrency?

This will depend on where you have signed up for your cryptocurrency exchange.  Typically it’s as easy as logging in, finding your wallet or holdings and then executing a sell order.  You should keep in mind that depending on where you live, you may be subject to income tax, capital gains tax or other legislation around cryptocurrency.

# What is DeFi?

DeFi is a term that you will hear a lot about during research for cryptocurrencies.  It simply stands for Decentralized Finance and covers a wide range of ways to invest in coins.  Being decentralized, it simply means that a number of entities will hold the information about the transactions at hand which gives no one person or corporation control of the transactions.

DeFi can be used in a wide variety of applications, such as loans.  Through different exchange servers, you can take out loans of cryptocurrency, or even put your own crypto into the server to be loaned out and make some interest on your funds.  DeFi can also set the platform for sports betting (using smart contracts).  For example; if you wanted to bet on a hockey game it could be as simple as if team XYZ beats team ABC, then payout at the following rate.  

# Is cryptocurrency legal?

For the most part, yes.  However, you will need to check with your local and national government for clarity around the rules and regulations for your specific country.  In most places, cryptocurrency is completely legal and subject to taxes.  However, new rules and regulations do come about frequently due to the infant nature of cryptocurrency (it’s not ***that*** old compared to traditional money).  

# Why is blockchain considered a transparent record of sales?

Because you can see all of the transactions back to the beginning of the blockchain, then you can actually follow coins with relative certainty in many cases.  With all of the miners, owners of digital wallets, stakers, etc. being on the blockchain to validate every single transaction (including transactions before the wallet joined the network, for example) then you can not modify a transaction in the past.

Imagine a government running on blockchain.  You know that $1,000,000 was allocated to a project and it was then associated with wallet XYZ.  You could follow all transactions associated with that wallet, and see where those transactions were sent to.  You know that part of the project was tendering a bid to companies in the local market for refurnishing an office but where did that money go?  With blockchain, you can see where it landed, how much was spent at that time and if something looks ‘off’ or a mystery charge shows up, then the proper people can be held accountable.

Not everyone would necessarily know where the money went (the address isn’t typically plain english), but someone on the oversight committee (for example) would be able to follow the transactions and quickly hold people accountable if needed.  Potentially; not more $50,000 toilet bowls being installed in an office just to use up some funds. 

# *Gas Fees

Something that you will start to see as you begin to research cryptocurrency and explore different forums on the internet, watch different investors online, etc. will be “Gas Fees”.  This term gets thrown around a lot as if everyone knows what it means immediately; which is impossible for a new investor in crypto.

Gas fees are specifically part of the Ethereum network and are a fee that is associated with the work that is required (computational power) to validate a transaction.  This is paid to the computer/computer pool who is working hard on the network to validate the work done on the Ethereum network.

# *How is a new cryptocurrency created?

Before we start this portion; I am not advising anyone to start their own cryptocurrency.  Rather, provide some basic answers to what really goes into creating a cryptocurrency and to provide some clarity in the differences of the two main types of currencies (coins and tokens).  So far, I’ve only used the word token, but there is a distinct difference between a coin and a token that can be explained easily.

So, if you were following the creation of a cryptocurrency, a new coin would be built on a new and distinct blockchain (such as Bitcoin or Etherum were created) and a token would be built to use that same blockchain to validate their own transactions (such as Litecoin or Dogecoin, for example).  In many cases, these new tokens are designed to enhance the original blockchain technology, but sometimes they’re just designed as an alternate coin that exists distinctly from the other, but with no real enhancements or long term technology planned to support future development.

The main point of this explanation is to provide some caution about getting into the next big coin.  You can create your own cryptocurrency in minutes just by copying to code from an existing coin.  On the plus side, you get a lot of security features and benefits (all the original benefits from the coin, including even Bitcoin), but on the downside, there’s no reason to purchase or use a coin that has no new features or enhancements.  To get a new cryptocurrency to grow and be properly promoted, you need extensive programming knowledge to ensure you can develop and add to the features already in existence - otherwise, what’s the point of the new currency?  With this in mind, you must do some research into a coin before adding it to your portfolio or collection.

To create a token, you will utilize the blockchain of an existing cryptocurrency (such as Ethereum) and you will benefit from the development team that is already in existence.  You wouldn’t need as much programming experience or know-how.  

# dApps

A dApp or Decentralised Application is an application that is developed on top of a decentralised platform. You know how there are iOS developers that are trained in specific languages and frameworks so they can develop apps for the iPhone? Or Android developers trained to develop apps for the Google Play Store? Well just like that, we have dApp developers who create applications for a decentralised platform like Ethereum.

The front end of a dApp (the bit that you, the user, interacts with) can be on a website, in a mobile app, or any other system that can interact with the backend. The backend (what's 'under the hood' so to speak) runs on the decentralised platform of choice (like Ethereum) and the records are stored on the blockchain itself.

You might think that it's simply a matter of platform - like choosing to develop for an Apple iPhone or a Google Pixel. But it actually goes beyond that. dApps are often open-source, meaning developers from around the world can contribute. This means more ideas, quicker fixes, better testing - and an all-round higher quality app. It also improves security because dApps come with the security benefits of the blockchain baked in.

## BAT Rewards can now be transferred into users’ Uphold accounts

With today’s updated Brave browser for desktop (0.69), Brave users can choose to transfer Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) out of their Brave Rewards wallet and convert the tokens to many digital assets and fiat currencies, after completing a verification process with digital money platform Uphold. Previously, the Brave browser wallet was unidirectional, and its sole purpose was to anonymously and securely contribute to online publishers of the user’s choosing.

As always, Brave users are not required to sign up at all to use Brave as a browser, nor are Brave users required to sign up anywhere to use Brave Rewards. The option announced today is for users who wish to take out tokens or to add their own.

Brave users who opt into viewing privacy-preserving Brave Ads earn BAT on a monthly basis (70% of the ad revenue), which is in turn donated to the user’s favorite online publishers and creators by default. There are now over [280,000](https://batgrowth.com/) [Verified Publishers](https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/) on the Brave platform. With the new Brave wallet, users have the option to connect to their Uphold account and be directly rewarded for their attention while browsing with Brave. They can otherwise store BAT earned from Brave Rewards in the wallet.

Once a Brave user is connected to their Uphold account, they can also add BAT they already own to their wallet, or purchase additional BAT from Uphold in order to further reward their favorite content creators on the web.

“Brave’s goal to reconnect users with creators and advertisers in order to fix the broken online ad system is now complete with the new Brave wallet, and we’re thrilled to have partnered with Uphold for this crucial development,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “The Brave browser offers unmatched speed, privacy, and most importantly an integrated wallet that rewards users and supports content creators, removing intermediaries that thrive on surveillance and fraud.”

JP Thieriot, CEO and co-founder of Uphold, underlined the importance of Brave’s mission to address the invasion of privacy that has grown with the evolution of the Internet: “Brave has become the first crypto ecosystem to jump the chasm into mass market relevance. Nobody is even close. It’s a huge, noble and wildly relevant mission to take back an Internet that has made all of our proclivities, susceptibilities, and private information the central products of a few dominant players. Taking on the juggernauts might seem quixotic, but for the fact that Brave is driven by the inventor of JavaScript and the incredibly creative and talented team he’s assembled.”

“At Uphold, we are at the fore of developing a new paradigm for portable, self-sovereign financial identity, and the intended outcome is as close to Brave’s privacy ideals as is legally possible,” he added.

*How the wallet works*

Users simply need to click on “verify wallet” in Brave Rewards to initiate this process. They will be redirected to an authorization page at Uphold. Once the user has registered with Uphold, a Brave-branded BAT “card” will be created in their Uphold account and they will be directed to connect their Brave browser to their Uphold BAT card. Brave does not store any identifying information about its users.

If a user wallet is verified, it will allow the user to:

1. Add BAT via fiat or other cryptocurrencies
2. Take out BAT earned via Brave Rewards and convert to fiat and other cryptocurrencies
3. Take out BAT they previously deposited in their Brave wallet
4. Store BAT earned from Brave Rewards

1612123763,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/l9kqtk/for_investors_who_got_burned_with_doge_heres_some/,159,261,"So I recently got back into reddit after taking a break from crypto in general. I started investing in cryptocurrency around 2017 while I was still in university as i was fortunate enough to be making money while studying.


I initially only invested 1 btc and after scouring the forums and reddit, I decided to invest in this coin called Confido. TBH, i cant remember now what the coin was about as I've actively suppressed my memory of that event ever since it turned out to be a scam and I cant seem to make myself go into my telegram or google to remember it again.


This was when I just entered the space and judging from what everyone who invested in the coin was saying, it was going to be the next big thing. As a clueless and young investor (I was 20 at that time), i decided to buy another 1 btc and bought more confido tokens. My interest in crypto was increasing by the day as I started to research more into other coins and learned how blockchain worked. Ethereum intrigued me, as it seemed to have more real world usage than bitcoin, and more importantly, a lot of ICO seemed to be running on that. As interesting as crypto was, my main goal was to make money and ICO seemed to have really good returns, and for that I needed ethereum. So I bought another 1.5 btc this time and 0.5 btc was put into ETH and the rest was put in confido (typing this part hurts as it always makes me remember the grief I experienced when that coin crashed as I watched it on my laptop in my empty dorm). I think I was one of the top 10 holders of this coin after that point.


Anyways, with a good chunk of ethereum, and with better knowledge about this space, I began to research more into blockchain technology rather than just coins and started to figure out which coins would have actualy usage. Got into a few ICO and was lucky to be in the pool for the intial investment. It was at this point, i knew I shud diversify my portfolio so I only spent 1 ETH on all the ICOs I liked.


Just as I was getting into all of this, the Confido coin I had invested 3 btc in turned out to be a scam and there were posts about it all over reddit. It was a frenzy in telegram as everyone started to panic sell. I decided to keep holding as I thought there was some mistake and its not a scamcoin. I was simply in shock watching my thousands of dollars investment plunge into nothing.


I dont think I've ever been this emotionally struck by anything in my life (maybe my first rejection from a girl in 6th grade would come a close second haha). I sat there in my dorm as I wondered why this happened. I was angry at the people who shilled it, I was angry at the ppl who made the coin, and I was angry at the community managers of this coin in telegram. However, I was most angry with myself with how naive and careless I was with money. I was hoping to save that money to buy a house for my parents in future and watching all of that disappear, I would never wish for anyone to go through that.


At the end of the day, it was my fault. I put money into something not understanding how it worked and how investing in general worked as well. ""Always invest what you can afford to lose"" I wish i went with that mindset when I started.


I tried everything to get something out of that coin but it was too late to sell as it was worthless. I had other coins as well as I was starting to diversify my portfolio but it was too late as majority of my investment was in that stupid coin. I tried to see if my ICO coins would help me recoup my losses but the market had entered a bearish run. I gave up and left everything related to crypto and decided to focus on my degree and job. I lost more than I could afford at the time, but i decided it was better to learn at this stage than later when I have a family to support. I have become a smarter investor after that incident and I learned how to better manage my finances.


Here's my advice to ppl who got burned by Doge coin. Take it as a learning opportunity of how the crypto space works. Yes, money is lost and the feeling of pain and regret is overwhelming especially if you put a lot of money in, but know that time heals. A costly mistake always prevents you from making a similar one in future. As much as ppl like to roast others who are getting burned from the Doge PnD, sometimes its hard to know what's going through the other person's mind when they bought the coin. Maybe they were just stupid and wanted to make money for a better life, but didnt have any information. Telegrams and reddits of shitcoins are usually an echochamber of people convincing you that the coin will raise in value. For someone who is new to the space, they dont have the info as the people who have been here for years have.


Seeing so many Doge memes roasting the people who bought at the peak made me recall the time I went through and I have sympathy for them. Some of them are delusional, yes, but that doesnt mean they're bad people, just lacking in information and crypto experience. Although I do have to admit, some of those Doge memes made me crack up, only because the face of the coin is an adorable chubby shiba.


So, don't dwell on the loses and just take it as a learning experience. Crypto space is wonderful once you are familiar with it and there are so many people here willing to help others out.


On the bright side, I came to see that some of my ICO coins are doing fantastic, especially Kyber Network and REN :)",CryptoCurrency,"For investors who got burned with Doge, here's some advice from someone who lost 3 BTC on a scamcoin in 2017."

This is a huge discrepancy not seen in other top subreddits. I analysed this below:

[Top 50 subreddits \(by subscriber count\) + 3 subreddits offering crypto rewards. Subreddits typically have a karma ranking similar to their posts per day ranking \(a value of \~1\) - or a higher karma ranking \(value of \&gt;1\).](https://preview.redd.it/5rb5az6d7oi71.png?width=1330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2f6fad6f74f86087e6e3613ff23700a93c9f5f)

The other 2 subreddits that offer crypto rewards (fortnitebr, ethtrader) are also low - but nowhere near as low as r/CryptoCurrency.

This is either because (i) users are reluctant to reward a post (ii) users are spamming low-quality posts (thus raising the posts per day count) in an attempt to farm rewards. **Or, in reality, a combination of both.**

Whatever the reason, we are now at an all-time low:

On Jan 1st 2021, we ranked #87 for posts per day and #121 for post karma. By May (BTC's $64k ATH), the gap had widened to #4 for posts per day and #345 for post karma.

We love Smile Train because each $250 donation helps a child with cleft palette lead a normal life.  

[Smile Train] (https://www.smiletrain.org/)

We will determine how much to donate after this post has been up 24 hours and post proof of our donation.  It will be easy to count since we just activated our vault and have 0 Moons.  We love what this sub is turning into - lots of positive energy lately.

**UPDATE**:  We know not everyone has Moons so we are going to count every comment and upvote as a virtual ""Moon"" toward the donation total.  You all have been so kind!

**CLOSING UPDATE**: With 171 comments, 358 votes, and 313 Moons we have a total of 844 contributions for Smile Train.  At 15 cents per contribution that puts us at $126.60.  My wife and I agree that this does not quite match the level of kindness and support everyone showed.  One surgery is $250.  This community showed a lot of genuine kindness so we are going to support three procedures for some wonderful kids that deserve to smile for the rest of their lives.

1. Coinbase is doing a direct listing of their stock in Feb or early March. This will be seen as bringing legitimacy to the biggest US crypto company and it's already being touted at a $50 to $75 billion valuation. With how other IPO's have been exploding in the market like door dash and air bnb and the recent GME/short squeeze craze, this could drive alot more institutional investment and hype to crypto.

2. Michael Saylor's Microstrategy Bitcoin conference on Feb 3. During this event, Microstrategy will outline why bitcoin is the best asset to buy going into the digital age to other companies at the conference. Although this will likely not immdediately up the price, it will bring awareness to other companies interested in investing into bitcoin and have a positive effect in the long term. Stone Ridge which is another investment firm that got into bitcoin last year is also co hosting the event with Microstrategy.

Secondly, dont buy stocks of crypto and that's basically what doge is....its fucking usless. I'm sure I'll catch neg karma for this but buy coins you can DO SOMETHING WITH

I get these stock bros see $BTC and think you missed the rocket ship. You have not. I bought my first coin at 340 something. I'm still buying today

Thirdly, doge is good pricing grounds yea, you see if mad people run it price goes up....then what? It drops because it's useless. 

You really wanna stick it to the suits look at what real crypto can do. $LTC $BCH $XRP and so forth...You can fucking buy it use it! and decentralize your currency...no regulation, you hold yours I hold mine....except in the case of exchanges....that brings me to my last point get yourself a fucking wallet. 

I'm so happy to see what reddit and WSB have done to the stock market but it will be stopped it will be regulated....crypto is a true revolution

Very very very lastly $BTC ain't anywhere were it could be 30, 40, 50 is still a great place to get in on if you dont believe me buy 50$ worth and sit on it for 3 months.

This is really no longer possible in my opinion. Can you imagine Bitcoin selling for $10,000 in 2021? I can't either. Even in the worst possible scenario, I realistically cannot see Bitcoin being priced at anything less than $25,000 for an extended period of time.

Moreover, the SEC might also allow an ETF. That will funnel at least a few hundred billion dollars into the Crypto market per year once it's done. The amount of money flowing into Crypto is insane. Couple that with the number of people that now know about Crypto.

Crypto is now an asset that almost every professional investor holds. This was not the case even just one year ago. There is absolutely no way that Crypto will ever go down to the levels we've seen in 2019 or even 2020. We've seen 2 bull runs and one upcoming bull run in just one year alone.

I worked for one of the founding BP's, made videos explaining how to register for the genesis block, was featured on EOSRad (before it was sold), and actually was paid in EOS by the BP. Essentially what I'm trying to say is I had DEEP involvement with EOS since about spring 2017, and I've lost all hope it will recover.

In my opinion, the first blow came when the arbitration governance failed. It failed because it was poorly thought out, but was needed to prevent BPs from vote buying. If there was an outside entity stronger than the BPs it could keep them in check. Unfortunately what happened was the BPs took power and then with nothing to check their power but votes, the exchanges voting with other peoples deposits used their votes to set up voting cartels that ousted even the best BPs who contributed such incredible value to EOS (EOSNY, EOSCANADA, EOSDAC, EOSCAFE, and more that I'm probably forgetting).

Once the BP voting cartels took over, they used the BP rewards as a money printing machine and created sell pressure. Not only that but all the airdrops seemed to create little to no value for either the holders or the projects and many of them died out. At this point, things were salvageable if Block.One came in with their 100m votes and voted back in good BPs and also fixed governance so vote buying couldn't happen. However, Block.One ignored the EOS mainnet problems, and the final nail began to drop, the slow, eroding of the community. Once community started to lose energy, excitement, and eventually hope, the slow death began and is still going on. I don't think EOS will go down in a blaze of flames, instead it'll be a token that slowly goes from a top 10 coin, down to a struggling top 20 coin, then to a depressed top 50 coin, and then into a ghost town top 200 coin. Some people will hold onto the dream but most will leave, just look at bitshares and steem if you want examples of what I believe EOS will become one day.

It's extremely depressing to have to face reality, but this is where things have been heading and where they still are.  Anyone holding EOS is just eroding their wealth hoping for a dream that will most likely never come. Snap out of your false hope, cut your losses and get out whatever you still can.",CryptoCurrency,Former EOS veteran loses faith in EOS.

There's really no science to this guy's life.   He's my age but looks double , but when he wants something he goes balls to the wall. 

He always said crypto was stupid.   

Anyway this guy calls me out of nowhere, says ""IM COMING OVER, I want you to show me how I can buy doge"". 

Sure.   He comes by.  First thing this guy does is slap 2 grand in fresh 100s on the table next to me and tells me to buy doge for him.   

NO PATIENCE AT ALL.  Like I have a stash of PKs on a hard drive waiting for him. 

I'm thinking most my shit is in wallets and I'm not parting with my shit coins either. 

So going through the process of setting up his account, I was trying to explain to him coinbase, his account, transfers, binance. Before I could finish half of a sentence... He tells me. ""I don't have time for this, just buy it"".

I bought Btc for him but there was a problem with his card. Only limited $1000 so we tried bincance.   Finally evil to get him to deposit 2000 I had to transfer BTC over for doge.   He said, ""I want you to sell it in 8 hrs whatever the price is and I'll be over tomorrow to pick up the money""  

I said.. woo wait a minute...you need to wait for the cash to transfer back to your bank account.    

 He starts fuming and says, ""NAH I can't wait, And I don't want BTC don't buy me that , there saying doge will hit $1"".   I told him I need btc from coinbase and he didn't understand. Just kept saying"" btc isn't going anywhere ""

Anyway, I bought doge, sold in 8hrs when It was down 60%.  He calls me up afterwards all pissed and then tells me to keep whatever is in there that he wants nothing to do with crypto ever again.

I get the frustration of having slow downs or crashes during peak times, I get it. But for people new to buying crypto it really is the best option. You can earn free coins by learning the basics about crypto which is cool.

Yeah they don't have 500 coins to choose from but for the beginning or novice crypto buyer/trader that's a very good thing. They introduce you to staking and converting currencies etc.

I'm not saying that people should only use coinbase but for beginners it's a great platform. Telling new users it sucks and they should go somewhere they can buy using leverage, convert to 500 shitcoins etc does more harm than good imo.

I started with coinbase, moved to coinbase pro and will eventually try other exchanges as my crypto knowledge expands. But coinbase was my entryway and helped get me going to where I'm much more comfortable looking at other options should I choose to do so.

There are far more scams associated with the dollar or fiat currency. I'm sorry if you got scammed by these and do not like the way I am talking about them.

Again, I'm doing this kind of post to get some focused discussion in this sub, so please sound off in the comments!

u/huskernatchamps2020 **‘s top 5 biggest scams to ever happen in crypto**

1. **Mt Gox-** Now if you are new to the cryptocurrency space you probably haven't heard of Mt Gox yet, as it happened in 2014 (what feels like 50 years ago). Mt Gox was a japanese based exchange and back in 2014 they were handling nearly 70% of all bitcoin transactions. In February they suspended trading and months later began liquidating their assets. Claiming that over 850,000 of YOUR bitcoins had been “stolen” or “hacked”. NOW I bet you're thinking, “hey dumbass how is an exchange getting hacked a scam?!” Well it’s a scam because in order to get ALL your bitcoins hacked you have to leave a glaringly obvious hole in your security system. This company gave the illusion that your bitcoins  were safe with them when in reality they were safer printed on paper and given to your grandma. Mt Gox users got scammed by the exchange with the illusion of safety.
2. **BITCONEEEEEEEEECT-** Holy hell I am so old I remember when this happened and I thank Satoshi everyday that I was too stupid to figure out how to invest in Bitconnect. This one is my favorite and I know the most so this will be the longest one. Bitconnect was released in 2016 with the goal of allowing users to lend the value of Bitconnect coin in return for interest payments. The marquee program was the so-called lending platform where users traded Bitcoin for Bitconnect Coin and could lock in the instantaneous value of the coin for a set period of time while earning interest calculated daily. The shares went from .17c to around $436 when they went full Ponzi and disappeared with everyone's coins after the feds sent a cease and desist. How in the world did they scam so well? They got influencers to promote their referral links to earn more money, simple as that. They got people you trust to give you their money, and in return the people you trust got paid.
3. **OneCoin-** OneCoin is probably the most insane scam on my list. These bumbling fucks managed to promote a cryptocurrency that didn't even have a blockchain. IT LITERALLY WAS NOT EVEN A CRYPTOCURRENCY LMFAO. OneCoin is said to have scammed anywhere from 9-19 BILLION DOLLARS from it’s users in the form of an education package disguised as a cryptocurrency. Their CEO went missing in 2017 and their backup CEO got arrested right after! Yet somehow they managed to pump this coin again in 2018-2019. HOW?!?! My god. This scam should be used as an educational package of DYOR and don't be an idiot.
4. **PinCoin and iFan ICO scam-** what kind of human would I be if I didn't include at least 1 ICO scam. After all, some people say that up to 70% of ICO’s fizzle out and disappear with your funds. But holy shit Pincoin and Ifan are damn near the biggest ICO scam in history. They made away with almost 700 MILLION DOLLARS. PinCoin and Ifan were ICO’s run by the same company Modern Tech. These fucks were masters of marketing and advertised 48% return in 1 month, and 100% after 4 months. They also offered 8% return on referral codes, and ran marketing campaigns all across Asia. Modern Tech seems to be a greasier unfunny version of Bitconnect, but at least some people made money on Bitconnect. NOBODY profited on this scam. SAD
5. **Elon Musk Scam-** Take a look at any Elon Musk tweet and you’ll see some people pretending to be him promising that “if you send X amount of BTC to this address I will send you back 2X Bitcoin in return for your trust.” This scam is all over the place and if my memory is right Elon’s twitter even got hacked and the hackers were able to scam Bitcoin from his verified account. It is estimated that millions of dollars have been scammed by fake Elon Musk alone, not including the other fake celebrity BTC scams. Jesus fuck, this is the new Nigerian prince scam that we all made fun of our boomer parents for getting scammed by. PEOPLE NOBODY WILL EVER GIVE YOU 2X BTC IF YOU SEND THEM X BTC!!!

LTO Network and Dusk Network will provide Dutch companies with lifetime access to blockchain benefits.

Last year, we publicly announced the partnership between Dusk and LTO to enhance the Dutch digital share registry and tokenize the share ownership of thousands of companies each year. With the recent release of the Digital Share Registry, the collaboration enters its next phase: tokenization on Dusk Network.

**3 major updates to share**:

1. The Digital Share Registry launched on February 16th, 2021.

2. The joint initiative increasingly enjoys regulatory agreement, as Europe and the Royal Dutch Association of Civil-law Notaries (KNB) express their desire for a digital share registry.

3. The collaboration will enter the next phase: from Digitization to Tokenization.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v6vwap8x21l61.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42037f4e1676a645cbfad891fb084f66c582557b

 The Digital Share Registry has been in the news frequently. In fact, European laws are currently being passed to mandate the inclusion of digital incorporation for the Netherlands. The Dutch Government has until the 1st of August 2021 to pass this law into effect. The Royal Dutch Association of Civil-law Notaries (KNB) has also confirmed their desire for a digital share registry.

Now, LTO Network and Dusk Network are collaborating to enhance the recently published Digital Share Registry with their blockchain solutions. In other words: the companies are jointly creating a Tokenized Share Registry.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g1n4au3y21l61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba0cf88cd02ed248be70508f4d3f1d8f9b754a59

In a Tokenized Share Registry, the company and its shareholders can seamlessly use other blockchain applications, such as trading infrastructure, or smart tools to quickly pay out dividend payments, organize shareholder votes, and more. And the best part is that companies are set up for a lifetime on blockchain with an ownership structure that grows alongside their company. This allows all kinds of businesses to access the benefits of blockchain, without requiring in-depth technical knowledge.

&gt;*“When we talk with clients about the possibility of tokenization, they can hardly believe that at time of incorporation, they can already secure a way for themselves to attract growth capital down the line. Whether equity, debt, angel investors, with friends, or on a public exchange, they are in control to choose whatever best suits their needs, at a fraction of the costs.”* ***Rick Schmitz, CEO LTO Network***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“Thanks to LTO Network, we are able to append the companies’ on-chain smart contracts with mandatory off-chain notary approval. This means we can bridge the gap between the physical and the digital, opening up a whole ecosystem of new possibilities for companies on the platform, and add thousands of transactions to the Dusk Network.”* ***Jelle Pol, Business Director Dusk Network****.*

The Tokenized Share Registry is an essential part of fulfilling our ambition of a modern and fair financial ecosystem. Together with partners like LTO Network, as well as [stock exchange NPEX](https://dusk.network/news/dusk-network-becomes-shareholder-npex-stock-exchange), and [Business accelerator Investor Ready](https://dusk.network/news/security-token-financing-investor-ready), we bridge the gap between the traditional world and decentralized finance. Companies in the Netherlands are blessed with their early access to a fully tokenized value chain, and the competitive edge it provides them.",CryptoCurrency,Why the Digital Share Registry is a major signal for blockchain adoption in the Netherlands

An airdrop, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. This ‘donation’ can be done either for free, or in exchange for a small promotional service.

Every once in a while, an airdrop can be hugely profitable. The best example was the Oyster Pearl airdrop. Even though this crypto is now dead, back in the time, the users could receive up to 2400 PRL, which eventually went up in value to over $5 per token.

But, as you can see on the following table (adapted from the excellent post by u/mortuusmare), 90% of the airdrops (or even more) are scams. At best you will never get your tokens. At worst you will end up in a scam costing you money :

[Out of 15 airdrops, 13 are scams, 1 is probably also a scam and 1 delivered less than promise.](https://preview.redd.it/x3ppui86u0l61.png?width=2589&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=290e8117d4ba98e4c91a90c4d13a5cc071935e5a)

People always mention that DYOR (Doing Your Own Research) is the key to avoid those scams. Let’s take a look at the last name on the list: Initiative Q.

Back in 2018, this project (founded by 2 famous ex-Paypal guys) coming out of nowhere and claiming that it will become the future of currencies became famous after being advertised by big crypto names. The only thing that you had to do was to register (thus give some of your infos) and invite as many friends as you could. Kind of attractive for people that want to earn without spending money. Then, depending on how many friends you successfully invited, you could lock some of their currency that you will later receive. The mainet was supposed to be launched end of 2019/beginning of 2020. 3 years later, nothing is done, and the project is probably dead.

I can hear you thinking: 1) Why should I care? I never spend money. 2) What was the point? Why did they do that?

So, never forget that Airdrops are not so harmless as they seem. And creating a specific e-mail with a particular password just for this task is always a good idea.

Nano is fast and feeless. Both fantastic and useful attributes.

It’s only slight faster and cheaper than other options. Take XLM - a transaction takes less than 5 secs and is basically feeless (.00001 XLM). Sure it’s a tiny bit worse on both cases but XLM also has an extensive roadmap and a lot more use cases.

With the influx of people new to crypto or perhaps even trading for that matter, I decided to share here my perspective. I often use a spreadsheet to mess around with various prices to see various scenarios (DCA, profit/loss, etc.)

Each coin I put in it's own tab. This allows me to play around with whatever I've purchased to see if I were to buy in at another price how that would affect my DCA and/or profitability. I try to enter previous transactions as close I can but not so detailed that I need to have 100's of rows. Once I've have past trades (and average costs) calculated. This allows me to enter the current price at bottom of spreadsheet (or using the live price from googlefinance function) and then enter the number of coins I want (or tweak the line to allow me to enter how much I want to spend) and see how it changes my DCA, profit/loss, etc.

Then as my first tab I have as a Summary. This pulls in the COUNT and COST for each of the individual tabs and then allows me to mess around with the current price to see how some scenarios may play out. I don't use this one that much honestly. Usually used merely as porn to make me fantasize how rich I could be if something goes crazy.

Feel free to check out a sample spreadsheet with some notes and examples on it:

NOTE: I tried to use the google function on some to pull in live prices but others are not available so require you to enter them (or a value you are wanting to see profit/loss for, etc.)

I assume I'm not alone in using something like this?

EDIT: /u/air_plant_cat_treats suggested I change the formula in E3 of each coin's tab to =SUM(D$2:D3)/SUM(B$2:B3) - notice the addition of the dollar sign - which would allow it to be dragged down and not have to individually change the formula. Cool tip...never knew that.

I thought with myself that, even thought he had lost it, he would not have invested if he had no trust in what he was doing, as I considered (and still consider) him a very smart guy.

I finally entered the space short after this conversation. Like most people here, in the beginning I tried to trade and lost a few bucks. Then I decided to hold but put a small amount into BTC first. I was extremely sceptical but eventually put a fair share of money (compared to what I had at the time) into BTC and ETH. I went through the March/2020 crash with my hands sweating, but did not sell. I decided to buy more instead, just in case. Of course, at the point I was investing an amount that I was OK with losing.

Surely you have noticed the XRP pump&amp;dump that took place two days ago. I am posting this as someone who completely fell for it. I hope that by sharing my experience I may gain some resolution and prevent someone else from doing the same mistake.

I am relatively new to crypto and went in way over my head. My strategy was to take most of my savings and put it on bitcoin for 5-7 years. Originally, I used €45k or $54k.

I went in when BTC was a little over 20k. But when it dipped to 30k, I threw my own strategy out the window and thought that I could time the market. As I lacked strategy and patience, it resulted in a loss that brought me down from 2 BTC down to 1.55 BTC. This was a lesson for me, which I should have paid more attention to.

Then on the first of February the XRP pump happened, so follow me for this ride (time in UTC):

https://preview.redd.it/be5aztpfq9f61.jpg?width=1486&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a433c4bee9b5dda80294d6cd09865051722f3b

1. **(05:00)** Early in the morning, I notice the rise of XRP, because it was promoted in various subreddits. A huge rise was promised because of some arbitrary reason (ripple filed its defence towards the SEC).
2. **(08:54) Buy order:** At this point, I thought it was a good idea to switch about 50% of my BTC (0.77) into XRP.
3. **(10:37)** **Sell order:** It started to work. It went up and I sold it for 0.787 BTC. This small profit made me even more reckless.
4. **(10:44) Buy order:** I saw a larger dip, which happened before on XRPs way up. I thought that this was a good spot to get in again. My goal was now to swing back to 2 BTC to remake my loss. A huge gambling red flag – as I learned later.
5. **(11:14) Buy order:** It’s up again! I thought that I should accelerate the gain by moving the rest of my BTC (0.78) into XRP. I am almost there! Somewhere I read that there was a huge pump incoming at 14:30. I was adamant about holding until then.
6. **(12:14) Sell order:** I didn’t realize what has happened, but now there was an even bigger dip. I panicked and sold, but I am now down to 1.157 BTC.
7. **(12:15) Buy order:** Another irrational decision, as I thought that this surely must be the recovery. So I went all-in again.
8. **(13:33) Sell order:** Another panic sell. Now I only get 0.9 BTC.
9. **(13:36) Buy order:** I thought that the loss is unacceptable and that this must be the recovery before the big pump! I go all-in into XRP again.
10. **(17:11) Sell order:** My final sell order. I am now down to 0.66 BTC and finally realizing that I got scammed and that I was left holding the bag.

Here is my transaction history from Bitstamp:

https://preview.redd.it/wm8as0598cf61.jpg?width=1269&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ae6cc3cd6af34e4685141d79d1b052de35c281

My worst mistakes besides not sticking to my HODL strategy were that I invested more than I could afford to lose, that I did not accept the losses, and that I fell for the obvious pump&amp;dump signs:

* The many posts that were advocating the XRP recovery.
* The speed as XRP gained significant volume over the course of a few hours.
* The rumour of a huge pump on a specific time.

Now there is a great guide out there on pump&amp;dump schemes by u/Anhowa123 that I wish I had known earlier:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4zsv/with\_the\_recent\_influx\_of\_new\_users\_i\_decided\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4zsv/with_the_recent_influx_of_new_users_i_decided_to/)

Apparently, everything was organized via a telegram group. I lost about €25k or 0.9 BTC in the pump&amp;dump. This is more than I can take to lose. Since then, I am devasted. I am feeling physically sick and stressed. I can barely eat, and I am too ashamed to tell anyone in person what I have done.

The worst part is that I have invested money that I inherited from my grandmother, who worked hard for this. I feel that I have let her down and I do not know what to do anymore. It would take me many years to earn it back.

Please don’t make the mistakes that I did.

**Update:** Thank you all for your kind words and/or the stern advise! It really helps me to process what happened and how I can prevent me from doing this in the future. After all, I live in my own apartment, have a good-paying job, and I still have some funds left. I still have 0.66 BTC, bought some ETH with stock profits (I actually managed some good long-term investing here) and will put my keys to my ledger so that I cannot access them so easily whenever I should feel the impulse to daytrade again. My plan is to HODL for 7 years and maybe DCA once I rebuild the stock money that I invested in ETH.

I learn this the hard way. 

I'm fairly new to this crypto madness, but what I've learned in the past months is that constantly checking your portfolio value and coin charts can by very misleading and ultimately make you do the wrong move.

Constantly checking my portfolio made me panic sell multiple times, jump from coin to coin, and stress about nothing more often than not.

Even when the market was green all over I manage to make the wrong moves and switch coins or sell at the worst possible moment.

I know that at first glance it might sound stupid, or maybe I'm just dumb, but for me, it was definitely a challenge to stop doing that, and since I stopped I actually made a profit.

I can answer three out of four:

**How did we get here?**

We pretty much had a perfect storm of conditions all aligning at once:

\-Grayscale announced the reopening of it's ETH trust. This is one of the biggest factors, as it causes a massive influx of institutional investors.

\-VISA announced additional partnerships and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

\-Introduction of ETH futures trading.

\-Volatility in traditional markets due to the short squeeze of GME, among other market factors.

\-Introduction of new investors to the crypto space due to the dogecoin pump and dump.

All of these things together caused a skyrocket in demand from day traders, retail investors, your boomer parents, and institutional investors all at once.

**Could we have predicted this?**

Absolutely. Take a took at this 1 month chart and see if you can identify any patterns:

[oh yeah you like that don't you](https://preview.redd.it/h5qid9480bf61.png?width=2635&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36df1c69790b25b46e158b0554be267b47f06bfe)

That's right baby, we're in the classic ""Vitalik's Dong"" formation.

From the moment the rally breaks $1k at the taint, you can see a clear pattern form. The price hits alternating higher highs and higher lows, forming the ceiling and base of the shaft, respectively. It starts to condense as we reach the tip and then splooges out into our current rally. Our current price point leaves us at an interesting spot: we're just lightly stroking the top of the shaft. If we can break through, we can expect to see a higher climax to our current rally. If we just edge that top, we may continue back down to the base and see a retraction to $1350. I think our most likely scenario, however, is that we continue somewhere in the middle: along the ""golden stream.""

1612399348,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lc32m7/understanding_market_cap_circulating_supply_max/,161,937,"Hello everyone! 

I've realized that a lot of people, specially new ones in this community don't really have a lot of knowledge about these terms and what each of them mean, so I decided to try to make everything clear so that people don't expect completely unrealistic things(like doge is going to reach 1000 USD)

So first things first what does each of those words you find in websites like coinmarketcap and coin gecko mean? Let's understand one by one:

**VALUE**

The value of a coin is the last price someone paid for that coin, note that it doesn't need to be a ""whole"" coin you can buy 0.0001 coin but the value is always stated as a whole coin. 

EXAMPLE: 1 BTC = 37.791 USD this is how much the last BTC transaction cost to the buyer corrected for 1 BTC. ( So if he bought 0.1 BTC he paid 3.7791 USD)

**CIRCULATING SUPPLY**

This is the amount of a coin that can be exchanged at the moment.

EXAMPLES: 

BTC = 18,618,562 
ETH = 114,525,091

Note that BTC circulating supply is way lower then ETH which means there is less bitcoin in existence now than there is Ethereum(this is very important)

**TOTAL SUPPLY** 

Total supply is the amount of a coin that can be exchanged + the amount that is locked(but already exists). NOT the amount that will be available in the future.

**MAX SUPPLY** 

This is the total amount of a coin that will ever exist.

NOTE: some coins DON'T have a max supply as there will always be new coins generated. Ex:. Dogecoin

**MARKET CAP** 
Market cap is a simple multiplication of the value of a coin with its circulating supply

Example: BTC: 37,791 USD x 18,618,562 = 703614076542

As you probably already know Bitcoin is the number one Cryptocurrency in existence today and that is NOT because it has the highest value, but because it has the highest market cap.

That is why 62% of the crypto value is in BTC, because that's the amount of money that is invest in that coin considering the amount of coins in existence.

so for Ethereum to surpass bitcoin its value DOESNT need to go 40k it needs to go to 6143 (at the current supply)

Just so you guys understand how absurd is the idea of doge reaching 100 USD, were that to happen at the current circulating supply (note that doge supply is always increasing quite faster then BTC and ETH) it would have a market cap of 12.8 trillion dollars which is 12 times more than all money invested in all cryptocurrencies at the moment. Oh but how about 1 dollar? Then it would be 128 billion.

**Conclusion** 

DON'T BUY A COIN BECAUSE THE VALUE IS LOW, check the market cap for growth but also check the technology and how other people might be interested in buying that coin as well.

Once you've done that, save yourself a potentially MASSIVE headache in the future and backup your 2FA. Ask anyone who has lost their primary device how much of a pain in the ass it was to get their access back to all their crypto accounts and you'll realize why. Most authenticator apps allow you to either enable multiple devices, export a token or generate a QR code to regain access to your 2FAs on another device. This is particularly important if you keep your authenticator app on your primary mobile device, which you're more likely to lose/break than a device that doesn't leave your house.

Those will not be full tutorials, just the steps needed. For a full tutorial you can use [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/j104px/how_to_setupuse_the_xdai_network_buyingselling/).

# Easy, fast, usually cheaper route:

* Go to [https://moon.nano.trade/](https://moon.nano.trade/)
* Press sell and fill in anything it asks you
* Send moons to the wallet shown, press ""done"" and receive nano instantly in your wallet

**Pros:**

* Fast
* Easy
* Simple

**Cons:**

* Prices are usually 10% lower for sell and 5% higher for buy but they vary. For example, at current rates, if I wanted to cash out 1000 moons, worth $158 on HoneySwap (holy shit!!) I would earn $124 instead. That's a HUGE fee of $34, and since it is a percentage, it would be $340 if you traded 10k moons.The same goes for buying, acquiring 1000 moons would cost you $158 on HoneySwap but doing so through this site would cost you $173.
* It sometimes has low liquidity. Right now the max amount you can sell through the site is around 4000 moons. Of course, if anyone buys, giving more Nano to the site, that limit would go up.
* **Important:** It is NOT a smart contract or a dapp. It is a centralized app that could be hacked, corrupted or bugged at any time. This is unlikely to happen because the dude is probably earning a fuckton from maintaining it functioning properly but of course, **that could change.**

# Long, not-so-fast, usually more expensive route:

First of all: moons are on a test network, not on the main ethereum network. Since it's a test network, you can get free ethereum (which is worthless, of course) to pay the gas fee. That said, the **simplified** process is:

**Only-once steps**

* Get free Rinkeby ETH from a faucet or by other free means.
* Add the xDai network to Metamask and swap some Dai for xDai to pay for the transaction fees

**Actual exchange process**

* Use a Moon - xMoon bridge to swap Moons for xMoons via smart contract. I like to use [http://moon-exchange.herokuapp.com/](http://moon-exchange.herokuapp.com/) for this.xMoons are on the xDai chain, so you've moved out of the test network already. xDai, just like xMoons, are swapped at a 1:1 rate with their regular counterparts in other chains (Dai and regular Moons)
* Go to [HoneySwap](https://app.honeyswap.org/) and trade xDai for xMoons. You're still on the xDai chain, which uses xDai as a substitute for ETH, so the fees are absurdly low, things like $0.0001 and such for a swap.
* Once you get your xDai, you can go back to a xDai - Dai swap and swap back your Dai and **there is the issue.** Let's discuss first the pros and cons.

**Pros:**

* Fully decentralized process! Every trade we do there is done via smart contract so there's no chance that the owner takes your moon bags and runs with them because **there is essentially no owner**. Pretty cool!
* Exchange rates are actual rates. It's a swapping decentralized app so there is no way to artificially inflate or lower the price.

**Cons:**

* Biggest con: two of the swaps have to happen in the ETH main network. The first one is the initial Dai to xDai swap. If you buy Dai from an exchange and send it to your wallet, you also have to pay a huge fee. Currently, swapping Dai for xDai costs a whooping **$40**.The second main network transaction happens when you, after selling your xMoons for xDai, want to swap back the newly acquired xDai for regular Dai. This process costs **$40 again**. Of course, you'll also have to pay the fee if you want to send it to an exchange to cash out, so make it $10 more.
* Unintuitive for newcomers
* Lots of steps
* Bridges are sometimes slow and get clogged up

# Important edit!

**There is a cheaper method that totally unfucks this mess!** Brought to you by u/VCGS on [this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lsg4z5/moons_are_in_a_bad_position_currently_when_it/gortvw5/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), there is an exchange named BitMax that features xDai on it!

Why is this so important? Well. The long method sucks because you have to go through an Ethereum main network swap. The fees on that are insane!

However, **if we can just send the xDai to an exchange, the transaction fees are zero**, or nearly zero (fractions of a cent).

The only fees with this method are the exchange fees. I don't know BitMax and of course, the downside of this method is that you need to go through a centralized exchange. However, I feel like this is totally fair and seems like the best method currently, letting us circumvent both the initial need for xDai (you can buy it already xDai instead of having to go through the swap) and the need to swap it back to Dai once finished. I'll try it and let you know how it goes!

___

So, back to the main topic of this post, buying or selling moons right now is very fucked up and we have to pay huge fees no matter what way we choose. I would love to end the thread with a proposed solution, however, I can't think of any proper way to solve the issue other than just holding your moons or stick to the huge fees.

Of course, you can either wait for a new way of exchanging to come up, or you can wait a few years for Ethereum 2.0 so the fees disappear.

1614759856,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lwowyw/my_take_on_lto_network_the_ultimate/,73,52,"I’ve seen LTO increasingly being mentioned in the daily discussion but I haven’t seen many posts talking about it so I thought I’d share my thoughts. **This is, however, not investment advice, just my conclusions from reading about LTO, watching webinars, reading AMAs and generally being involved in the community. As always, DYOR.** I’ve included a TL;DR at the bottom for those of you feeling lazy. 

-

LTO has some of the highest adoption in crypto. It is the top #197 by MCAP but it’s a top 10 blockchain by number of transactions (120k per day, with a steady 25% growth MoM).

The reason why it has so many transactions is because they already have quite a few clients using it, and some big ones (for example, the UN, with land registry projects in developing countries like Afghanistan) are yet to start properly anchoring transactions on the network, something which will only increase the number of transactions especially as similar solutions for more countries are rolled out. 

Before you accuse me of this being yet another shill of some ‘great tech’ destined to flip Bitcoin or Ethereum, I’m not specifically talking about its tech, actually. I’m talking about actual adoption and clients and a money-making business that does not rely on speculation to provide value. Txs on the network and their fees are paid by actual clients that are getting BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service) out of LTO. There’s enough ghost chains with ‘great tech’ and ‘potential’ and negligible number of transactions/usage valued at billions of dollars. A lot of projects get built in hopes that they will attract customers. LTO has done it the other way round, focusing on business and adapting the tech to meet the needs of its clients.

-

**But why buy LTO tokens?**

You might be wondering what these do and how they are used in the ecosystem. 
LTO tokens are used to pay for transactions and smart contract fees. So far, almost 100m have been burnt, what makes LTO deflationary. In fact, 11,000 tokens are burnt on average every day, since txs cost a fee of .35 LTO, of which .25 is for nodes and leasing rewards, and .1 is burnt. This translates to about 3.4 million tokens being burnt every year at the current rate, out of a maximum supply of less than 400 million. You can stake the tokens by setting up your own node or lease them to an existing one (since it’s a proof-of-stake blockchain), and contribute to decentralisation and the security of the network, thereby earning LTO tokens. The staking currently earns you 7% APY, but this could go up based on tx growth and it is done through the LTO Network wallet. Tokens are also used for governance, allowing node operators to vote on network proposals. 

-

**But how can investors benefit from buying in - would a high token price be good for clients? Surely the team would want to suppress the price so that they don’t lose business?**

Let’s say, for instance, that the price of LTO goes up a lot in a short period of time. Nodes can then vote to lower the transaction fees to accommodate for a higher token price to keep the price low for customers. Customers can, however, just run their own node to contribute to the network and get a share of the rewards or use a validator to handle all that and not be impacted much by a rising price since that’s all factored into their business agreement - paid for in fiat for a flat amount. A lot of clients do not want the hassle of dealing with tokens or nodes - and that is perfectly fine since they don’t have to for LTO to provide their services and for us to benefit from their transactions. The team, in fact, has a portion of the total supply locked until the price reaches an acceptable (I.e not undervalued) level and they can use the funds for mergers and acquisitions with/of other great projects to add value to customers. Recently, VIDT was acquired in order to provide verifiable identities as part of the LTO product offering.

-

All of this, if anything, leads to the logical conclusion that LTO is criminally undervalued, especially when you compare it to other projects that are basically ghost chains with zero clients or adoption, and just promises and price rises tied to speculation, hype, and FOMO. LTO’s mcap is currently $105 million, currently trading at about $0.38, and its ranked at #197 by mcap. To put it into perspective, at HOT’s (Holo) market cap, top 100 on coinmarketcap), LTO would be worth $1.66. At VGX’s (Voyager Token), top 50 on cmc, it would be worth $5.39. At BCH’s (Bitcoin cash), top 10, it would be worth $36.20.

LTO just needs more exchanges and more recognition, but you can currently buy it on Binance if you have access to it. People in the US can also buy it, it’s explained [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/LTONetwork/comments/lhuxys/buying_lto_in_the_us_cheap/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf). This is not ideal, but the team is actively working on getting more listings and we should get some updates on that soon. This should only lead to more buying pressure and visibility. The fact that the Binance LTO wallet keeps getting drained day by day is a great indication of where LTO is going and destined to be.

I’d be interested to hear about any FUD/concerns about LTO because I haven’t found any since I started investing. I would also be interested to know about other undervalued projects with so much going for them in a way that would compare to LTO.

**TL;DR** - LTO is a b2b blockchain that already works and is being used with growing txs every day by big clients. It has a lot of growing potential due to a small market cap and it not being listed on a lot of exchanges yet, good tokenomics due to its deflationary nature, staking rewards, and an actual use case for the token.",CryptoCurrency,My take on LTO Network: the ultimate criminally-undervalued alt

It's popularity and use has grown ever since its release.  It seems however to be suffering an unfortunate side effect of that success.  Recently the high levels of activity on Ethereum have caused transaction fees to rocket to over $20 on average.  Many users are reporting being hit with fees several orders of magnitude higher.  Ethereum 2.0 is in the works to rectify this however no clear launch date has been set.  What are your thoughts, can Ethereum's popularity weather these high fees?

**1000 Moons** *or* **$4.99** doesn't make any sense. Even at the lowest moon value *ever,* at $0.0092, thousand moons were worth nearly twice as much as the membership cost in USD. Not to mention that at the current price, **1000 Moons = $81.05**, which is more than enough money to cover your subscription for **16 months!** ^((and not only that, you're left with a few moons after all that time as well))

Changing the price of moons according to their value, so that subscription in moons would cost $4.99, was already suggested in this subreddit and I hope we get a change in that direction soon. If that would happen, currently, the **subscription would cost 62 moons**.

But, this post doesn't just highlight this idea one more time. I think we should **reduce the price in moons even further**. Doing that people would be encouraged to use the cryptocurrency of this subreddit, and this is the ultimate goal - **making the MOON cryptocurrency more useful**. It doesn't have to be much but a 5/10% discount for payments made in moons should do the trick.

On the other hand, we can keep subscriptions in moons to cost $4.99, and **raise the price in USD** a little (to let's say $5.99). That way, the **subscription would still cost the same ($4.99 in moons)**, but people would more commonly use moons because they would become the best deal.

Whatever the final decision would be, it only makes sense to **adjust the subscription price to the live moon value**. 

For anyone wondering where to **check the current valu**e of your *hard-earned* moons, you can do that on **Coingecko**.",CryptoCurrency,4.99$ or 1000 Moons for the subscription doesn't make sense

**Tldr**: Crypto taught me about how to be a financial adult in a world where financial freedom means a whole lot of confusion and moral ambiguity 

Just like covid I can see my life as before crypto and after crypto. Honestly, its how it feels. I feel like learning crypto isn't just learning about bitcoin and alt coins and mining, its about understanding how you as an individual handle and manage your financial personal sovereignty.

I grew up with the attempts of being taught to save my money. Poorly, but they were attempts. Financial classes at school about 401k's and retirement plans roth whatevers. It never sunk in. I thought I was lazy or dumb or maybe something was wrong with me because I wasn't caring or couldn't understand these things that were supposed to secure and protect my future livliehood. Not just for me but for my family as well. Financial responsibility is a heavy weight and I just couldn't integrate it into my life. The same with college, it just didn't get me. College lacked luster, I had no passion for it. I blamed it on this and that and everything inbetween. It wasnt until later in my life that I began to dissect where ""college"" truly was for me, where that experience was for me. It wasn't in a university, it was within my curiosity. At another more recent point in my life I began to dissect where my financial investments were too, and so Crypto entered my life.

I've been just sucking in so much info; reading, learning, practicing, taking risks for the sake of experience, podcasts. It's not work, it doesnt feel like it. It feels liberating. It feels so filling and freeing. I feel a strong pull of purpose in my life and I feel like I finally am beginning to understand concepts from my financial classes that were weighed down and drenched in stupid politics and jargon. I don't mean to come off as I am putting down college or 401ks or anything, I understand they have their place in peoples lives and have done good. I am saying though that crypto is what touched me and made me really begin to take back my life and what my money means to me. College didn't touch me, and neither did learning about stock trading and cd's.

Learning about blockchains and mining and the ins and outs of all this stuff has impacted soooo much of my life that I want to just talk to everyone about it. And if im being honest its brought some sadness. People don't want to hear about it it seems. Even if they listen they aren't invested and I totally understand that cause I was just the same. Yet the resistance hasn't halted my excitement. This is going to wake people up to a new way of being, I do believe that. Cryptocurrency will be a tool in helping people see how their money interacts with the world around them in a personal way. I don't mean to come off as culty or holding up crypto as this sacred thing cause who knows what the future holds and what new technologies it could bring but from my experiences and how its affected me it has changed my life undoubtedly. To everyone who took the time to read this I wish you the best and im glad to see you here",CryptoCurrency,Learning Crypto has fundamentally changed me

I don't come from a wealthy background. enough to get by and to have some luxuries, but very much working class. I first heard about Bitcoin in 2012 and passed up on buying 10BTC at $10 each because the exchange required ID and I couldn't be bothered. I've lived with that regret ever since, and have foolishly kept to the sidelines observing crypto from a distance. recently I decided to invest for the first time, for the reason that I don't want to live with that regret for the rest of my life. I'd rather lose money I can recover than wonder ""what if?"" for the rest of my life. 


anyway, after lots of research on crypto I settled on a split of Cardano, Nano, and Bitcoin. I've been mining banano using at folding@home, lending out my processing power to help advance medicine and earning the banano cryptocurrency in doing so. I feel like I'm a part of something much larger than myself. if you're not aware of banano or folding@home for crypto I highly recommend checking it out: /r/banano. It's a great concept with a strong community and it's a great way to get people into crypto, as banano (it's a fork of nano) transfers instantly, no fees, it's kid-friendly and laid-back. lots of fun. btw, if you're new to banano and are interested in it send me a message and I'll send you some banano :)


anyway, what started as a small investment turned into a second savings account. the benefit crypto has had on me is twofold:


1. If I had the money in my bank account, I would feel tempted to spend it if I had a higher than usual amount. By locking away crypto in a wallet and treating it as a long term investment, that money won't be spent on a whim. as a result, my crypto wallet after 3 weeks has more in it than my savings account did at its peak (profit aside)


2. cryptocurrency in general gains value over time. instead of just having a savings account that I don't touch and whose value decreases over time due to inflation, my cryptocurrencies gain value. a 5-10x price increase over the next several years is not unreasonable. 


I've never had hope for my future, financially. I resigned to living a poor, working class life a long time ago. I never thought I'd have any money. with my increasing levels of chronic pain, I've begun to worry that I may not be able to work for much longer.


Crypto has changed all this. I now have so much hope. I have a savings account that is decentralised and isn't through a corrupt bank (always hated banks, so crypto makes sense). and that savings may well 10+x over the next however many years. if it did that, I may never have to work a job I don't want to ever again. I'd be able to rest easy, not worrying about getting through each work week with chronic pain. 


crypto can change my life forever. but more importantly, it can change the world forever. it's exciting, and a privilege to be a part of this. it truly is a once in our species opportunity.


thanks for reading this long, pretty self-centered post. feel free to share your own experiences/give any input, I'd appreciate it.

He is known for being one of the early investors in Yahoo (bought in 1995) and Alibaba (1999) as well as the man behind the Vision Fund. The Vision Fund is the biggest tech VC fund in the world and has been an early investor in Uber and DoorDash.

Son is also known for being the man that lost the most money in human history (roughly $70 billion out of 76 billion of personal wealth in the 2000 dot com crash); Softbank crashed from $180 billion to 1.1 bil during that time as well. Now that the high flying Vision Fund has soared this past year (which 99% decrease in profits year-over-year in early 2020), it's obvious to see who Masayoshi Son really is.

Son is the OG HODL-er, the real diamond hander, and the first ""this guy fucks.""

2 things to learn about HODL-ing from Son.

1. If you're going to HODL, you better believe in what you're HODL-ing. Son was a huge believer in the future of the internet. DYOR and HODL only what you completely believe in. This helps you mentally prepare and commit to a reasonable investment plan. For example, my friend committed himself to buying XX dollars of ETH every $25 dollar drop in ETH price during the 2018 downturn.
2. You can only HODL what you can totally throw away. This is the good old ""don't invest more than you can lose."" Masayoshi Son could HODL so much only because he was already rich and could risk a lot.

# 0. Staking and methodology

Staking cryptocurrencies is something that may interest a lot of retail investors who do not wish to participate in active trading. Staking allows a coin holder to receive passive income through a reward or forging system.

The number of coins or tokens that you have or the amount you are willing to stake will affect the quantity of staking rewards. It’s a bit like a savings account but with much greater freedom and a decent profit.

Staking is in its essence basically a form of mining, that rewards the users of the blockchain network, because the users of the specific project chose who their Node operators and ultimately Staking providers are. These operators are called miners for coins like Bitcoin. However, staking uses fraction of electricity and computational power that bitcoin mining needs, while still keeping the network running. Poetry of blockchain engineers.

I decided to make a comprehensive guide that will cover a glossary regarding staking and other blockchain terms. The main take-away should be a closer look at a list of projects that I will compare based on how profitable, prospective and user-friendly they are.

The choice of projects featured includes popular, innovative and original projects. I have either direct experience with these projects or I have researched and tested them out. In my opinion, these projects are relatively low risk.

I studied 40+ projects and eventually limited my choice to 9 blockchain networks. This journey was actually really interesting.

Before starting it, I was staking in 2 projects and I thought the market was flooded with projects covering insane staking rewards and incredible possibilities. I went to the opposite end of what I know from my experience and researched ERC20 staking – realizing it is complex and risky.

Therefore, I focused on user experience and risk mitigation. This led to a rabbit hole of discovering new and amazing projects. I slowly started to realize one very common denominator for the best staking projects. All of them are focused on creating technology for block-chain interoperability, deploying their own blockchains and parachaining. Each has its own unique take on how to solve this crucial factor for adoption (covered in Chapter 4). This reasoning is clearer when you understand the difference between Proof-of-work and Proof-of-stake.

The foundation of the tech behind the projects should be a major point of interest when comparing these products over their profitability. One of the deciding factors was also the development activity behind these projects ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub)). That is why extreme profit projects with 0 tech are not listed here.

To make this guide a bit more interesting I had a couple of crypto beginners try out this selection of projects and noted their opinion in the evaluation part of this guide.



Important notes:

* Any project with less than 3% annual rewards is not included (eg. EOS, NEO, TRON, VET, LSK, XLM).
* As mentioned, sometimes there is a risk associated with staking (usually very high-profit types with 20% and more yearly interest). This means that any project that has a risk of losing the staked amount or significant rewards is also excluded.
* ERC20 tokens are also excluded as their staking is more complicated and riskier. DOT and KSM are exceptions because their slashing is negligible for users (not validators, however).
* Exchange staking is included briefly as it also carries a risk but that is mainly in the concept of not your keys, not your coins axiom.
* I decided not to include ETH 2.0 in this guide, because it means locking a large number of assets until it launches (so do your own research after you finish this guide).

# 1. TLDR: Summary for Staking in Native Wallets

I decided to start this post with a summary, because there would be a wall of text before the “good stuff”. I hope this summary will motivate you to read through the rest of the post and find the logic and reasoning behind it. I decided not to give any project an overall rank and listed them alphabetically (there is no best to last, that is for you to decide). Instead, I summarized key features, profitability and evaluated UIX (from crypto-beginners) and tech aspects (by studying whitepapers and roadmap completions).

Some projects have grown in a way that staking was always available only in third-party wallet and since that is their native environment, they deserve a place here.

Staking in native wallets will always be the most secure way to stake your coins. Never forget to back‑up your seed phrases.

**If some terminology in this table is not clear – head down to the glossary in the next chapter. Every single evaluation category in the table is explained in project overview of Chapter 4.**

Table 1: Native wallet - profitability

|**Project**|Coin|Native Wallet|APY %|Lock-up period|Pay-out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Algorand|ALGO|Yes|6.5 %|None|Transaction claim|
|ARK EcoSystem|ARK|Yes|8-9.5 %|None|Daily|
|Avalanche|AVAX|Yes|9.2 %|14-365 days|After lock|
|Cardano|ADA|Yes\*|4-5 %|None|5 days|
|Cosmos|ATOM|3rd - party only|10.5 %|Variable\*\*|Claiming with fees|
|ICon|ICX|Yes|13 %\*\*\*|5-20 days|5-20 days|
|Kusama|KSM|Yes|14 %|7days|Claim (21 days expire)|
|Polkadot|DOT|Yes|9-12 %|28 days|Claim (84 days expire)|
|Tezos|XTZ|3rd - party only|5-6 %|None 20 days to confirm|3 days**** |

\*ADA native wallets are developed by third-party but they are exclusive to ADA

\*\* ATOM locking period depends on user but to switch delegation you have to wait 21 days.

\*\* ICX interest changes a lot, can be from 6-30 %, overall is about 10–16 %

\*\*\* Tezos requires to initially confirm assets for about 14-20 days. So PoS rewards kick in after time, then rewards pay out every 3 days.

|Coin|Consensus|Ease of staking|Tech|User experience|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ALGO|PPos\*|Easy|7/10|8/10|
|ARK|DPoS|Easy|10/10|10/10|

|DOT|DPoS\*\*|Hard|9/10|4/10|
|XTZ|PoS and DPoS|Easy|8/10|7/10|

\*PPoS is a form of PoS where anyone on the network can decide what to do with blocks –achieving great decentralization level

\*\*Dot’s and Kusama’s DPoS is called NPoS, but is just DPoS with possibility to punish bad delegates (slashing)

# 2. Glossary

Table 3: Essential blockchain terms

|**Term**|**Explanation**|
|:-|:-|
|**Blockchain**|Immutable or permanent ledger (registry) maintained in multiple locations known as **nodes**.|
|**Node**|A software instance on a Blockchain network responsible for participating in consensus, maintaining the ledger, servicing or relaying transactions, or all of the above. A node is the most basic unit and critical part of a blockchain infrastructure.|
|**Node operator**|Person or group of people responsible for maintaining a node. A network refers to all nodes in the operation of a blockchain at any given moment in time.|
|**Network**|Collection of nodes that communicate with one another to form a system.|
|**Transaction**|An exchange of data or value between Blockchain addresses or networks.|
|**Consensus**|General agreement between node operators on the state of the Blockchain and/or ledger. In decentralized systems, which are composed of a multitude of node operators the decisions are made collectively.Consensus is needed to provide the state of the network.|
|**Finality**|Property of a Blockchain network that determines how well the consensus mechanism can render new blocks immutable (permanent)|
|**Consensus mechanism**|Method by which consensus is reached, which can vary drastically based on the protocol. Examples include Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, and Delegated Proof-of-Stake.|
|**Proof-of-work**|Prime example where this mechanism is used is Bitcoin network. Where miners race to solve complex mathematical problems, adding new blocks and generating new coins to validate transactions. Miners consume large quantities of electricity to do this.|

Table 4: Staking Glossary

|**Term**|**Explanation**|
|:-|:-|
|**APY %**|Annual percentage yield|
|**Ease of staking**|A metric considering the difficulty of set up to earn rewards via staking. Either explaining how hard is it to get your assets to start staking, how much is the minimum amount of tokens for staking and how much attention you have to bring staking.|
|Easy:|Very fast setup, No fees and extremely small minimum stake, none or small lock period, fast payouts and very occasional attention to status.|
|Moderate:|More hassle when setting up staking account, minimum stake required, lock up periods, payouts take longer or require unbonding, can require claiming rewards.|
|Hard:|Abysmal user experience, high entry point, long lock-up periods, payouts after lock-up periods, payouts with long unbounding or claiming, expiration of rewards.|
|**Native wallet**|Wallet developed by the team behind the blockchain project. First functionality of it is built exclusively around the native token. Provides highest amount of security for staking. Many native wallets are expanding beyond and depending on project development allow holding new assets through interoperability, testnet tokens or even top crypto coins.|
|**Third party wallet**|Well known multi-asset wallets like Exodus or Atomic wallet that started to allow staking within their interface.|
|**Exchange staking**|Locked staking on an exchange, there is some risk but can be profitable.|
|**POS**|Consensus mechanism where all coin holders enter a lottery to add new blocks and receive new coins, weighted by the holdings within each address. Consumes far less electricity than PoW.|
|**DPOS**|Consensus mechanism where Staking providers are voted in by coin holders are reponsible for maintaining the ledger, adding blocks, and generating new coins. Since DPoS is a form of democratic governance. The Staking providers share their proposals of how they will share rewards and help the network.|
|**Staking pool**|Pooling funds together with other investors for staking is similar to the concept of pooling hashing power in mining pools.|
|**Staking provider**|Ensures consensus on the network for providing staking rewardsGeneralized name for the terms: Delegate, Delegation services, Delegator, Generator, Producer, Baker, ValidatorSome networks can utilize 2 or more of these specific examples to differentiate roles if needed.|
|**Staking hierarchy**|You are a Voter – You vote for Staking pool or Staking provider – Staking pool or provider are Node operators (validators) that confirm transactions on the blockchain network and that share the rewards with Voters|
|**UIX / UX**|User interface experience, User Experience|
|**Stake**|The number of coins or token that **participate** in staking.|
|**Vote / Voting**|Transaction type that assigns your tokens to a Staking Provider and determines your Vote Weight. Most common cases. A small fee transaction to choose Staking provider that assumes all assets on the address you vote from as voting power (Flexible) OR Requires committing assets as Stake voting (Not Flexible)|
|**Flexible Stake / Flexible Balance**|You only have to vote from your address to stake pool or a delegate and all assets on your address are assumed to participate in the voted pool. You can move your tokens anytime and proof-of-stake is calculated from minutes to hours.|
|**Stake Voting / Stake Lock / Staked Balance**|Where one token represents one vote in the network. The total number of coins that have used the voting right to indicate preference for a Staking Provider. A vote where you commit an amount of tokens through a transaction to your staking pool (Quite often requires locking, bounding)|
|**Vote Power / Vote Weight** |Quantifiable amount of influence that a voter could assign to Staking Provider. Determines your staking reward among other network-specific things based on the project you are supporting. In Flexible Stake it is usually all the assets you have on your address. In Staked Lock you usually chose how much vote power you have specifically.|
|**Slashing**|A form of punishment for delegated in DPoS that are not working properly and are trying to game the system.|

# 3. Native wallet vs 3rd-party wallet vs Exchange staking

Native wallet summary was already included above in Chapter 1 and is the safest form of staking where you own your private keys. I advise to always make good research on how native wallet staking is available for the projects you research.

Third party wallet staking is a good option if you find a reputable wallet. The choice of third party wallets are included in Chapter 4 project overview. In general: Exodus, Atomic, Huobi, Guarda

Table 5:

|**Project**|**Coin**|**3rd party wallet**|**APY %**|**Lock-up period**|**Pay-out**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cardano**|ADA|Yes\*|4 %|Yes and no|5 days|
|**Algorand**|ALGO|Yes|6.2 %|Yes|After|
|**ARK EcoSystem**|ARK|No|\-|\-|\-|
|**Cosmos**|ATOM|Yes|10 %|Yes|Claiming with fees|
|**Avalanche**|AVAX|No|\-|\-|\-|
|**Kusama**|KSM|No|\-|\-|\-|
|**Polkadot**|DOT|Yes|8 %|Yes|After|
|**Icon**|ICX|Yes|10 %|Yes|After|
|**Tezos**|XTZ|Yes|5.4 %|None|3 days|

\*More wallets beyond Daedalus and IOHK

&amp;#x200B;

Exchange staking can be useful for some, but dreadful for others. Never forget, not your keys not your coins.

Table 6:

|**Project**|**Coin**|**Exchange staking**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Cardano**|ADA|Yes|
|**Algorand**|ALGO|Yes|
|**ARK EcoSystem**|ARK|Yes|

|**Pay-out**|After unbonding||

# 4. Project overview and useful links

## Algorand (ALGO):

Algorand is a decent staking project considering profitability and ease of stake. It is so easy that all you have to do is move your Algo to their wallet and you are staking. There is no lock-up period for receiving rewards. They are calculated to your address in a pending form just by being part of the network. To claim them however one needs to send or receive a transaction (even if it is a 0 Algo message over blockchain). Their main goal is to work with banking institutions.

## ARK Ecosystem (ARK):

Very nice profitability and extremely easy to stake in native wallet. Requires only to download their easy-to-use native ARK wallet and vote for a Staking Provider (delegate). The wallet has downloadable plugin for rewards calculation to help chose a delegate based on your voting power.

Ark staking is risk-free. Your assets are never committed or locked and rewards are calculated and paid out daily. So you can see your balance rising everyday and the daily rewards are calculated towards your new staking reward the next day.

ARK has been one of the pioneers in blockchain interoperability solutions since 2017. The team behind ARK has been delivering everything on their yearly roadmaps and has some amazing products lined up for Q1 of 2021. They are very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub))

## Avalanche (AVAX):

Fairly new project that had main-net launch in Q4 of 2020. As usual around main-net launches the price rocketed and is now consolidating. The staking rewards are decent for AVAX, however, setting up staking accounts is a bit more tricky for beginners. There is a variable lock-up period that the user can freely choose from and rewards are received after this period. They have yet to prove what they promised in whitepapers, but the ambitions are interesting.

Their main net is pretty interesting though: [https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/why-avalanche)

## Cardano (ADA):

Also a project from 2017 that probably will have the biggest recognition on this list. They never failed to deliver what they promised and should be considered one of the most solid projects in this list.

Their might have one of the lesser staking profitability on this list but they make up for it with the great ease of staking. Rewards are paid out automatically every 20 days and the assets of the addresses are never locked. Calculations are done daily so it considers your transaction history during the 20 days. Therefore it is risk free. Their “native” wallets Daedalus and Yoroi are easy-to-use.

Some great news are coming from Cardano in the upcoming months so be sure to have them on your watch list. They recently hard-forked to allow more interoperability with chained tokens. They are also very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub)). They are a Top 3 crypto project for a reason.

## Cosmos (ATOM):

Cosmos has generous profitability and decent ease of staking. The coin can be staked in many wallets due to integration of their SDK in them in order to vote for Staking Pools. The only tricky part is the fact that you have to claim your rewards with a fee to the network.

Cosmos launched in Q1 of 2019 and they just recently finished their first whitepaper and launched their new road map of Stargate. This proves that they can deliver what they promise. They are also very active in development ([https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub](https://twitter.com/ProofofGitHub))

## Icon (ICX)

This Korean based blockchain that started of as an ERC20 has very genours profitability and moderate ease of stake. They are deeply embedded in Korean strategic partnerships and seem to be delivering on their roadmap.

They separated from ERC20 base to their on blockchain during 2018. They are now one of the most profitable staking projects.

## Kusama and Polkadot (KSM and DOT)

Kusama is a canary network of polkadot and works on the same principles so I put these together. Both have one of the most profitable stake value in their native wallets and exchange staking. However, the ease of staking in their native wallets is pretty hard for beginners. This coupled with lock up periods and claiming rewards and their possible expiration does not create a good user experience. One could compare that the profitability makes up for that but having it on your mind all the time is a negative experience.

However, they are backed by huge VC and have very ambitious tech lined up. They have yet to prove what they are capable of.

## Tezos (XTZ)

Tezos has an acceptable profitability and moderate ease of staking. There are is an confirmation period of 14-20 days where you commit your adress to a baker and when your assets are confirmed by the network the pay outs roll in every 3 days. You are free to use them and get pay outs very regularly. They are a liquid network so you will have to vote for Staking providers. 

You vote simply by delegating funds to a baker they agree with while bakers(validators) actually cast a vote during the on chain governance process.

Tezos uses a variation of a Proof-of-Stake system that differs slightly from established models in that block producers are not selected by token holders and anyone can participate as a baker (validator) if they hold a specified amount of tokens. Token holders that do not meet the minimum threshold can delegate their tokens to a baker without needing to relinquish control of their tokens.

If you’re still not “sold”, here’s some interesting points.

1) The class is taught by professor Gary Gensler.  You may (now) know him better as the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 

2) Sitting in the class is Silvio Micali, a computer scientist and founder of Algorand. 

3) Also making visits to the class is Larry Lessig who is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the former director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University

Test them and try to restore so you know the software is legit. 

2. The exchange only seems like a good wallet til they are hacked remember the term ""Not your keys, not your crypto""

3. Dollar cost average to minimize losses.

4. Always buy the dip and hold or have an exact game plan for stop limits if you are a trader. 

5. Take profits but never sell the whole bag. I ditched 200 solana for 1g. Yes im an idiot. 

6. Low transaction count is easier to keep track of and always keep track! Will make tax time easier.

7. Dont try and hide it your not doing anything wrong. 

8. Do hide it from friends and family, if your not married why does the SO need to know. I know it's exciting but they will expect same results and will most likely not put the effort in and get pissed.

9. Stake stake stake.

10. Think about the next 3-6 years and how many boomers will be scammed because they gave away their seed. We haven't even got started on the loss porn. Gonna be tragic. Don't be one of those ppl. 

11. DONT ever send crypto to anyone you don't expressly know no matter how legit. especially exchange support. I was scammed out of 1000 ADA. Yes im an idiot. 

12. Know your investments and research or when it dips you will not believe in the project and want to sell. 

13. There is no get rich quick scheme, time is the only thing that will grow your portfolio. 


14. Btc and Eth are without a doubt the safest long term investment...don't expect your eth shitcoin to be there long term. 

15. Eth gas fees are super high don't mess w those transactions unless you like lighting a match to hundreds of dollars. Token Metrics recommends  at least 25k in Eth to make the fees worth it. 

16. Always send a little amount first to make sure everything legit- one rule I follow is when copy pasting checking the first three and last three letters of the TX address. 

17. Secure your moons there is a vault phrase for them.

I had him make a wallet and sent him some ETH from my profits because it was just a small amount of my holdings. Then he bought me a drink and he continued to do research.

Now that the big dip is happening, he's still asking me for advice, but he's not angry because it's not his money that's being affected. Now he sees that this kind of fluctuation is normal, so he has a better idea of getting into the game.

So far, he hasn't bought any more, but this would be a pretty good discount sale to go in on.

I would like to share some of my tips and knowledge here, hope you like them! 

Guides:

Stick to your personal trading rules and ignore noise/hype. 

Don't FOMO into a coin. Price always pulls back so never chase the pump and never buy at the top. If there's nothing to buy. Wait for a good entry. Let the pump come back to you. 

Expectation: you won't get rich overnight. After buying a coin, don't expect it to double overnight. Just be very patient with a coin before considering selling it. Just remind yourself why you bought the coin in the first place! 

The crypto market is unpredictable, anything could happen. 

I wouldn't recommend leverage trade/ shorting now - We're in a bull market now so it's not wise to take extra risk to leverage trade or short the market. 

Remember: most traders lose money, and the richest people in the world you know are long term investors, not traders. 

I have made much more money by investing mid-long term than going 20x on trades thinking I'll get rich overnight. 

We're in the middle of a bull market now and I don't think we're at the top yet. There's still money to be made but don't expect you can 100x your money, though I believe 10x is still quite possible. 

On that note, just focus on finding your 10x coins rather than aiming for a 100x moon coin, it's just unrealistic now. The time to make 100x is gone. Prepare to buy in the next bear market to prepare for the next bull cycle, that's how people make 100x.

Exit strategy:

While it's fun and exciting when we're in the middle of a bull run. But remember, this bull market won't last forever. While it's good to take advantage of this opportunity to make life changing money, don't forget to plan your exit strategy. Always remember to take profits. 

For example: if you're lucky enough to make 10x. Take some out and put it in Btc/ Eth for long term investments. Take some out to a stable coin so you can rotate the profits into another 10x coin. Take some out to fiat so you can enjoy your money. Leave 5-10% in the original coin in case it will still moon. Have a plan! 

Know when to sell:

Write down your price target when you buy a coin so you can ignore noise, FOMO and emotions down the track. When the coin is approaching your price target then start shaving off the profits. Remember: you don't have to sell the whole thing, you can always sell 10%—20% to take some profit out. 

You can dollar cost average in, and you can always dollar cost average out.

Above is not financial advice.

No you’re not looking out for anyone. You’re mad because people are making money off of something that you dismissed.

No, people who hold SHIB aren’t stupid, no matter if it dumps. Millions of people have made tidy profits off SHIB, and some of them talked about this back in January when we saw the devs behind SHIB were smart as shit.

SHIB, Doge and every other meme coin is not a shitcoin. A shitcoin is an altcoin which is any coin other than Bitcoin. Meme coins are advertising for crypto and good for hyping the currency as a whole and to make money off of if you play it right.

Paying attention to meme coins have changed my life, but be warned that If you first hear about a meme coin on Reddit it’s almost always too late. Researching each project, ICOs, following trends and getting in insanely early by investing a few bucks is the way to make huge gains without risking real money.

Patience, open mindedness and attention to details.

Meme coin investors are not stupid unless they are.

Some people here think the world owes them guaranteed profits. You have invested in a project you believe will reward you with something bigger in return, yet you lose your cool every time you see red or it has been a *“stablecoin”* lately. I think this bunch of people either bought when lumens was at .40-60.

I believe that the people who have the largest holdings don’t even moan about this price. They have a strategy instead. They don’t constantly check the price and complain about how XLM is dipping or not pumping up hard lately. They are probably buying this dip more, or they have cashed out their initial investments and let the profits ride. They are probably more interested in learning what Stellar does to check if its mission is still being actively developed and upheld by SDF, so they’ll have the assurance albeit **not guaranteed** that they have put their money in the right project. They are probably the most patient ones cause they are secured by the fact that Stellar has gained more adoptions, and it has been around since 2014. It has survived the harsh crypto winter by developing more projects.

Cryptos have definitely caused a lot of “investors” (might as well say speculators) to have short-term memories and expect numbers to go up instantly. When they don’t, they think the coin is a shitcoin and jump into another one.

It is funny how we even call it cryptocurrencies when people don’t treat them as currencies but assets.

I get that it is highly frustrating knowing how XLM still hasn’t reached its ATH while some coins did. What this just shows me is that the market is irrational.

Consider Doge, a memecoin but went parabolic; XRP with Ripple being sued for selling XRP for profit yet it is still soaring; CAKE and BAKE which rose to a high price because of the DeFi hype; ADA with no real projects built yet but future speculations; ETH with congested network and high gas fees; and BTC which has failed to become a digital P2P currency and is now branded as a store of value.

If we talk about fundamentals, Algorand (I don’t hold any) and Stellar are at the forefront. The Marshall Islands used Algorand to issue their national digital currency called SOV. LTO has also gained partnerships with UN and the Netherlands Government.

We can say as well that Ethereum is at the forefront(heck even Bitcoin as it has the institutional backing), but until now it hasn’t fixed its scalability issues and the high gas fees. Sure, Layer2 exists like Loopring but majority of people still use Layer1 and using Layer2 solutions is actually not user-friendly. If Cardano can indeed deliver, then I don’t think Ethereum will be the main player in the long run.

If you look at CoinMarketCap though, most of the projects in cryptocurrency space are either a knock-off of Ethereum or trying to be the next Ethereum.

You have Binance launching its own DEX and taking opportunity of the crazy yield farming hype. You also have ATOM launching its own interconnected blockchain which sounds really cool, and you earn some sweet stakes at 10% APY, but the question that always crosses my mind is this: *what important problems are they trying to solve, and have they really solved at least one thing?*

Because all I see when it comes to these projects are: GREED. GAINS. SHORT-TERM. *HYPE.*

You can even earn 30% APY on some. How sustainable is this?

**It’s clear. The market is irrational.**

When all this hype goes down, I hope projects tackling important problems like Stellar will rise up, and maybe just maybe, XLM will be valued fairly.

**We know that XLM is undervalued.** We know that many traders use it as their bridge currency for exchanging their cryptos or moving coins between exchanges. We and they know that XLM has a great potential.
Just a day ago, a leading mobile operator in Turkey, Paycell, announced support for buying and selling of cryptos and guess what? [XLM is supported again next to ETH and BTC.](https://www.coinkolik.com/turkcellin-paycell-uygulamasi-ile-artik-kripto-para-alim-satimi-yapilabilecek/)

*[Ever heard of the gas station in Croatia accepting XLM, BTC, and ETH too?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/croatia-tifon-gas-stations-hope-161428643.html)

*[Buying rums in Bermuda with a digital dollar issued on Stellar](https://www.coindesk.com/bermuda-to-pilot-digital-dollar-for-rum-sales)

*[Getting cashback rewards](https://paymynt.money/#blockchain)*

*Have you also heard that you can send absolutely send remittances now to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Tanzania, South Africa, and Nigeria using Stellar?* You can. Just use a Stellar wallet like Lobstr.

*What about creating NFT on Stellar without paying huge fees? You just need 2 XLM at most.*

*Do you even know that Stellar has an in-built DEX? Right. What does that mean? Well, if you download or use any Stellar Wallet, you can do P2P trades (buy, sell, or swap) for a fraction of a cent. In a simple word? You have instant access to a decentralized exchange. Stellar is a payment and a DEX platform at the same time.

The most famous Stellar tokens gaining traction? Well, Smartlands (SLT) with 7 million total supply tokenizing assets like real estate and agriculture and has a fee-pool incentive of 33% going to SLT holders holding €1000 of SLT as well as AKON which is being adopted in Africa.

As you can see, the tokens listed on Stellar are actually solving different purposes. They are not just a knock-off of Uniswap.

Listen. All major exchanges have stellar lumens (XLM) too. Another news? Coinbase will be launching their own debit card with 4% XLM cashback.

Lumens can be moved easily fast and cheap. It fits the most crypto of crypto as a currency.

Stellar is not all about hype and future speculations. They have the products working already. I believe if we value XLM based on fundamentals? It is easily a top 3 coin.

Its founder Jed McCaleb is also not a shiller. Some might say Stellar should up their marketing game, and they are working on that now. But I appreciate Jed for not being like the rest of the founders and devs who participate in Twitter shilling.

It’s clear. You can’t really call it a *failing crypto* or mock it as a *stablecoin.* I’ll wait till this underdog rises up. If I lose money, so be it. I have principles even in investing: I only invest in projects that solve important problems and do the work diligently without building so much hype than putting my money in projects fueled with hype but can’t offer anything tangible on the table.

To hotdogs and rums. *Only Lumenauts will probably get this.*

I'm very bullish about this, because it hints at actual adoption, speculation, market viability, and true tokenomics outside of shady / grey-market goods. Even the most common purported coin - Monero - which might be used for illicit activities, represents a very small share of the total crypto market cap, and further demonstrates that the true value in crypto is not grey or black market, but truly above board investment, speculation, value storage, and adoption.

I started to educate myself and been reading about crypto in late August to gain rudimentary understanding. I then got serious about investing in crypto and started to buy BTC and Algorand in  September. Some in ADA and LINK thereafter. I still don't know shit about all the intricacies and all the tech involved, but the potential for returns is off the charts!  Oh, sending crypto is so quick and easy!

I started to do even more search and signed up for additional exchanges and soft wallets to take advantage of their unique benefits.

1623669530,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nzkidz/personal_story_about_a_metamask_scam_going_around/,196,84,"*Good morning, everyone.*

This is a personal story that really hurts, and hits home, hard.

I hope to bring awareness and attention to all the scams and scammers in the ecosystem. I am tired of people being conned and overall, just over all the bad actors/players in the space. Again, I hope my story helps people pay attention and just double check everything and anything, anytime you send a transaction or load up your wallet.

I was an early investor into the company called Telcoin. I had been one of the first people to really dig into what they were doing, and I started sharing all that information to everyone that was willing to listen. One of those people that decided to listen to me was my father. I would like to give a little back story about why this hurts me, so please bear with me.

I grew up in a broken family at a very young age and I would move back and forth between my parents. As I grew older, I decided to live with my mother because all of my family lived in the immediate area, (even my dad’s side). So, me and my father never really had that chance to bond, as a normal father and son would. It wasn’t until I left for the military and grew up a little bit, before my father and I started to really have a best friend bond.

Now that I have given a little back story, you can see why this is emotional and again, one of those people that believed in the research that I did, was my father. Back in October he finally took the plunge and invested $2,000 USD into Telcoin. He was able to amass about 5.5 Million Telcoin at that time. The price started to climb higher and with that, we would talk to each other every day. Whether it be about the price, news, speculation or even announcements from the team.

We started to bond more on something that I was truly passionate about and dedicated a good portion of my time to. We were sharing information back and forth and were trying to find ways to help the ecosystem grow.

The time finally came for me to make sure he was set up right and that he finally got access to his assets. So, I created a separate wallet and put the tokens in there for him. It wasn’t until his recent visit that I gave him the ownership to the wallet. I gave him his seed words and he was able to successfully load his wallet up on his mobile device. I had told him about Metamask and how it was a safe reputable wallet that offered many options to help hold or trade digital assets. However, you need to make sure to keep your *seed words / private keys* safe. Write them down and put them in a safe. He was very adamant about keeping them safe, so I had no worries. The very next day, my father ended up leaving and heading back up north.

A couple days had gone by and I get a message about his tokens not showing up in his wallet. Me being confused, I called him and asked what was going on. He said he had downloaded Metamask on a new computer he had bought from Best-buy the day prior. Long story short, it was a fake Metamask browser extension. Whenever he loaded it up, it functioned exactly like Metamask normally would. However, this one asked him for his seed words / private key, 2 times. Once he put those words in again, he received ETH directly to his wallet *(Because he only held Telcoin in the wallet)* and all of the 5.5 Million Telcoin was sent to another address and swapped on Uniswap.

*Here is all the information I could come up with –*

Then they swapped it on Uniswap 2 times.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tell this story because the scammer didn’t just take $182,000.00\~ USD away from my father, they took away that bond we were building through something I loved and enjoyed. That is what hurts the most.

I hope you all never have to go through something like this. Please be aware that we are very young in digital assets / cryptocurrency and many new ways will be conceived to try and scam you.

Lesson, always be on your toes, double check that send address and most importantly, NEVER GIVE UP YOUR PRIVATE KEYS!

- A survey by S&amp;P Global found that only 26% of American women have money in the stock market. Even less in crypto market. And even less in the European Union since it’s less common here. I would say 10-15% of European women has crypto investments. He meant that it’s nice that I belong to this small percentage. He did not meant that because “I have a small brain”, it’s a big deal.

I know I could probably get a slightly higher rate if I had more money and was a more important customer but that’s besides the point. 


Even if you help 100k in this account, annually you would get £10 annual interest. That’s ridiculous.  

Even using the most basic of methods you can earn much higher rates with crypto. Coinbase offers 2% on DAI, which is a stable coin, you can get 5% on COSMOS, 5% on XTZ. 

This is with no effort, if you really look further into staking you can get even higher percentage returns. 

I’m not saying you should put everything you own into crypto, however it’s hard to ignore the much higher interest rates, even with the risk factor.

Here, I'll explain why all of these chains might be ticking time bombs. I try to keep my posts as simple as possible, but this topic is very important to me and very few seem to be talking about it, so I'll go into more details. It's very hard to be succinct here because there's just so much so wrong with delegated-type proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Please note that this is still a personal rant, rather than a research piece. I don't expect anyone to read this or do anything about it, and delegated-type proof-of-stake chains will continue to be the norm, but I must get this off my chest.

But first, a bit of personal context. I debated about including this bit, but I thought it'd be interesting. One of my interests in this space was I always believed proof-of-work to be unsustainable long term. This is why I first got interested in BitShares (the first dPoS chain), and later was heavily involved in the Steem community (the second dPoS chain). I always knew this consensus mechanism was highly centralized, but it was a straight up trade-off. They used a fraction of energy, silicon and other resources, enabled 3 second block times and 1,000 TPS in 2015, all of which is something most chains still can't do today. Some may recall Steem was the #3 project in mid-2016 and in the top 10 for most of the year.

In 2016 I co-founded a DAO (shout out to Curie folks, still going strong!) that went on to run a consensus witness (top 20) on Steem. While no one knows about it, I'd claim Curie was one of blockchain space's first successful DAOs (ironically, it was formed right after TheDAO melted down), and had built up seven figure holdings within a year or so (a lot of which evaporated in the bear market...). In 2017, I walked away from Curie and Steem when I realized that, actually, delegated proof-of-stake was not the solution. The trade-offs were not worth it. Indeed, the eagle-eyed might find hundreds of comments from me in 2016-17 heavily criticizing Steem and its consensus mechanism, on Steem itself. I wasn't the only one, of course, but our criticisms went largely ignored, to devastating consequences.

In March 2020, Justin Sun acquired Steemit Inc - chief developers of Steem - and his first action was to get CEXs to collude and take control over Steem. He succeeded, and to this day, as far as I'm aware, Steem remains under attack. There has never been a greater failure of consensus mechanisms in blockchain history. I'll note that the original Steem community forked away to Hive, but this is not a solution. What was once the #3 project behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum is ostensibly split up into two (and actually, multiple other smaller forks) at #220 and #260. Anyway, my point is that I'm probably the only person in the world that ran a consensus validator on a delegated-type chain and voluntarily walked away from it, so I do think I offer a unique perspective here. I know Vitalik has commented on the Steem attack multiple times, but he wasn't an integral part of the Steem community, and missed some of the nuances that I observed.

EOS and Tron were the last chains to share the Graphene-lineage from BitShares and Steem. Starting with chains like Cosmos and Tezos, they significantly improved on the dPoS concept. Of course, due to the stigma associated with dPoS, they started calling them just ""proof-of-stake"". Call it whatever you will, the fact is these remain delegated-type proof-of-stake chains. I'd rather just call them delegated instead of delegated-type, but I'd rather avoid the ire of shills of those chains. As an aside, correct me if I'm wrong: Binance can take over the Tron blockchain and its $30B in USDT at any time they want.

Anyway, here are the improvements made by modern delegated-type chains, and why I contend it's still a terrible idea:

# Plutocracies and cabals - not trustless or permissionless

The first thing was to increase the consensus validator count from 20-30 to a few hundred or perhaps removing limits entirely. This is definitely a big step forward, but it doesn't really address the issue that delegations are nothing but popularity contests or plutocratic elections. Whether you have 20 consensus validators or 1,000: the most popular few dozen to a hundred validators will always garner the most votes. And these validators can absolutely collude to form cabals. In most (but not all) delegated-type chains, They have nothing (or relatively very little) at stake and nothing (or very little) to lose - they are just abusing stake delegated to them from others. As such, this is not actually PoS, but more like Poos - proof-of-others'-stake.

The average validator has no chance, few if any would vote for them. If you run a CEX, are a popular influencer, or know a bunch of whales, you win, everyone else loses. It's absolutely not a trustless and permissionless system: you're trusting the whales to elect the right validators, require their permission to validate the network on an even playing field, and the whales are then trusting the validators. Granted, as the token distribution decentralizes, the first bit becomes less problematic, but at this point most delegated-type chains also have very centralized token distributions where a supermajority of validation is undertaken by a small cabal of validators and whales.  Given that many of these chains have very centralized token distributions, all you need is a few validators to convince a few whales, and the chain is yours.

This gets worse and more centralized over time, as the top validators and their delegators grow their relative holdings. Cardano has a bizarrely naïve mitigation for this with the saturation limit, but this has proven to be utterly useless. You can't prevent sybil attacks. Case in point: Binance runs over [70 fully saturated validators](https://adapools.org/pool/caf8502f66536e95138fbf23c14abde1d13090d4aef52b9287f682e8). If anything, this just makes things more centralized as regular stakeholders have more cognitive overhead to figure out which validator of many held by a single entity to vote for; while centralized entities like Binance can easily automate this process, spinning up as many validators as they want, self-voting for themselves. Fortunately, other chains have avoided this trap, but my above point holds: plutocratic elections where the winners are paid to consolidate their dominance is plain abysmal.

# Bribery markets

One of the biggest issues with earlier dPoS chains were that validators could just bribe delegators to vote for them, creating a market of bribery. The second innovation these newer chains made was to ""pre-bribe"" delegators. It's been marketed nicely as ""staking rewards"", but make no mistake: it's merely just a bribe to keep you in check, so you'd not accept bribes directly from validators. Of course, validators are free to create a secondary bribery market over and above this, from their own rewards, but it does help. The other problem was that there was limited incentive to delegate your stake. With incentivizing delegations, much more of the stake is now delegated. This makes newer delegated-type chains significantly more secure.

# Harsh recovery from attacks

It's definitely much more difficult to attack a modern delegated-type chain for the reasons stated above, but it's still possible. Now, different delegated-type chains have different methods and I'll acknowledge some which do things better than others later, but let's consider the typical delegated-type chain like Cardano. If you do manage to attack a typical delegated-type chain like this, it's lost forever. The only recourse then becomes a massive social coordination effort.

# High inflation, economically unsustainable

For a delegated-type chain to operate sustainably, you have to both keep your stakeholders bribed, and your validators incentivized. This means very high inflation rates, typically above 10%. Talk about crypto being an inflation hedge to fiat - these delegated-type chains are even worse. They'll claim that the plan is to reduce inflation rates over time, but actually, that's not how it works. Delegators will stop accepting the pre-bribes if the inflation rate falls below a certain level. Worse still, if the high-TPS delegated-type chains actually gain the activity they claim, it'll be very expensive to run validators over time, as state bloat bites hard. Validators would need serious incentives over a long term. Of course, the token's price will also appreciate, but it's not clear where an equilibrium can be found.

# No culture of verification

Another drawback to high-TPS delegated-type chains are they are not actually trustless. The high system requirements means the average user or developer will never be able to run a full node or verify the chain - so you're trusting the validators, over and above the fact mentioned above that they are elected by plutocracy. Consider this perfect quote by Hasu: [""You defend against malicious protocol changes by having a culture of users validating the blockchain / Not by having PoW or PoS""](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1376998067040366593). Of course, not all delegated-type chains are high-TPS. You have low-TPS chains like Cardano and sharded chains like Polkadot that this particular critical issue doesn't apply to as much. However, even these chains require validators to be online 24x7x365 and could have high system requirements anyway.

# Potential solutions

Frankly, there are many more related issues that come with the territory of plutocratic cabals, but I'll stop here.

Am I being paranoid? Yes, absolutely. The probability of a modern delegated-type chain being attacked is low, but it's possible, and when they stop being ghost chains and have substantial value, there might even be an incentive to do so. Only the paranoid survive, as Grove said, but even beyond that, we should strive for better solutions. There's no reason not to.

So, what are the solutions? Clearly, proof-of-work has its own issues. Potentially, ""true"" proof-of-stake without delegations might be it.

Chains like Polkadot include hybrid solutions, where they take the requirement for validators posting a significant bond with slashing mechanisms from ""true"" proof-of-stake, while continuing to be a delegated-type consensus mechanism. The advantage here is that unlike most delegated type chains, if its attacked, the validator and delegators will be slashed, so the chain will be able to recover. Another interesting solution is Algorand, which randomizes its delegations, so that mitigates the bribery attack vector from validators to delegators.

But the best solution, so far, is to simply remove delegations entirely. This is easier said than done, as we needed new tech like weak subjectivity and signature aggregations to make it happen, which didn't exist before 2020 or so. Currently, there's only one chain that does this, and that is Ethereum beacon chain. (Yes, I know there are older chains that don't have delegations, but beacon chain the first one that mitigates some of their issues at scale without succumbing to delegations). Beacon chain eliminates a lot of the risks mentioned above, and is a fully trustless and permissionless system where each validator has an equal and predictable responsibility to validate the chain, and only needs to be online \~60% of the time to turn a profit. You don't need to ask whales for votes, you just stake and are just as relevant as any other validator. Economically, this is much more sustainable, with Ethereum's issuance rate for validators being 0.5% currently, up to a maximum of \~0.85% when the proposed active validator cap hits. There's no need to bribe anyone. Needless to say, this is an order of magnitude improvement over the typical delegated-type chain. However, it has its own issues:

\- It's still a plutocracy, and whales can run an arbitrary number of validators. Unfortunately, this is simply an inherent flaw of proof-of-stake. What works in Ethereum's favour is that its token distribution is significantly decentralized already, after 6 years of high inflation proof-of-work mining. I'd say this is the best mitigation possible: run your network as proof-of-work for several years before transitioning to proof-of-stake.

\- 32 ETH is too much. Even if Ethereum has a culture of users verifying the chain, and the system requirements are reasonable for the average user, very few people can afford to stake 32 ETH in an experimental platform. This in turn leads to delegated-type pools form on top of beacon chain.

Now, one line of thought would be that delegations and staking rewards are natural, and it's what people want. I'd argue that everyone wants free money, but whether it benefits the network in the long term is an entirely different question. No, we don't need delegations, and the goal would be to eliminate them as far as possible. I'm hardly a cryptographic researcher, so please don't take my solutions seriously, but here's one possible way we can overcome all of this and finally make a sustainable consensus mechanism, once and for all:

\- Start with beacon chain.

\- Introduce an active validator cap. Ethereum researchers currently propose this at 1.048 million, but it could be much lower than that given what comes next.

\- Introduce a smart, dynamic rotation mechanism, while dramatically dropping the staking requirement to 1 ETH or so. There can be 50 million validators, but only a small fraction of those are active at any given time, managed pseudorandomly by the rotation mechanism. It makes it nearly impossible to co-ordinate any form of attack. It's still not 100% perfect, and there'll still be delegations, but we'll get to a point where its so massively decentralized that it wouldn't matter.

\- Minimal viable issuance: Lower the rewards to the bare minimum. Like I said above, you don't need incentives for non-validating stakers: just enough so the network is secure, and has enough non-delegating validators on board. On a related note, mitigate MEV. Rollups will take the lead on this, and the best solutions can then be adopted on L1.

**To summarize**, delegated-type proof-of-stake chains are by their very design plutocratic cabals that centralize over time, exposing a multitude of security vulnerabilities, and are very expensive to sustain with high inflation to mitigate some of those. Some delegated-type chains are more secure than others, but Ethereum's beacon chain proof-of-stake marks a giant leap forward, but still has its own issues fortunately with potential solutions. As an industry, we can, and must, do better.

Lastly, I see one usecase for delegated-type proof-of-stake where it might be viable. Ironically, on chains that make almost all of these delegated-type chains obsolete: rollups. On rollup chains, because security and decentralization has already been contracted out to L1, sequencer decentralization only need to perform the task of liveness and censorship resistance. Delegated-type proof-of-stake can do this, without any of the security compromises mentioned above because it doesn't actually have to provide security, though even in this case I can see rollup developers adopt better solutions.

PS: For those requesting, I'll now be cross-posting on Medium: [https://polynya.medium.com/why-delegated-type-proof-of-stake-is-unsustainable-f18cf42e6112](https://polynya.medium.com/why-delegated-type-proof-of-stake-is-unsustainable-f18cf42e6112)

PPS: Please don't ask me for my thoughts on XYZ project. I tried, but I can't keep up as most of my responses are ""It's yet another delegated-type chain"". I'll say that Ethereum beacon chain does not have any concept of delegations, Algorand randomizes delegations, Zilliqa uses proof-of-work, and Lukso is adopting Ethereum's beacon chain consensus mechanism. To the best of my knowledge, every other smart contract chain is a delegated-type chain. Of course, you have rollups which are smart contract chains, but they leverage the L1's consensus mechanism. Yes, they all have their own variations and differences, but this is not a comparison of delegated-type consensus mechanisms. This doesn't matter - my beef here is with the concept of centralizating validation to a plutocratic election, which is something all delegated-type chains do in some way, to some extent or another, except the ones mentioned above. Indeed, even the above mentioned chains feature this to a much more limited extent, as I pointed out, and brainstormed some solutions to mitigate this.

Please understand this is not a your chain versus other chain thing. I just want to point out some flaws that should be improved upon, that's all! I know you're angry that you're angry I criticized your chain unfairly or wrongly, but please take it easy.",CryptoCurrency,Why delegated-type proof-of-stake is unsustainable

These are not only counterproductive and naive arguments but also distracting from real reason why these people are so much against crypto. The real reason why all these people against crypto is not their age (or being part of previous generation). In short, these people are so against crypto because they are statists to the core.

For example, Nouriel Roubini, Paul Krugman and Janet Yellen are followers of New Keynesian economics. It's even in their bio in Wikipedia (check ""School or tradition"" section). The only way for them to accept crypto is to completely throw away their Keynesianism because it's inherently statist. That's not going to happen and it has nothing to do with their age or generation but with their desire for state controlled economy.

Furthermore, one of godfathers of crypto is actually Friedrich Hayek who wrote famous book called ""The Denationalization of Money"" in 1976:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Denationalization\_of\_Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money)

Here is a short video with quotes from Hayek:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-uo-KfnkhI)

By the time, he gave this interview (1984), he was 85 years old man and he was way ahead of his time!

Cryptocurrencies are just modern embodiment of almost century old debate - Keynes vs. Hayek.

Milton Friedman also predicted rise of cryptocurrencies (he called them - anonymous e-cash):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwxdyLnMXM#t=14m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwxdyLnMXM#t=14m40s)

He gave this interview (1999) when he was 87 years old.

Timothy May wrote his famous essay called ""The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" in 1988. This essay had a big influence on Wei Dai:

[http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt)

By the way, this essay is the first link in original Bitcoin whitepaper. Timothy May would turn 70 this year. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2018.

Even long before, Hayek and Friedman, Carl Menger wrote free market theory of money called ""On the Origins of Money"" (1892).

In short, crypto can't be inherently generational thing because its philosophical/economical foundation created by 100+ year old men (if they were still alive today). The real reason why all these modern ""economists"" oppose crypto is because they are statist to the core and they will never accept the idea that something can exist outside of state control (especially money!).

So real debate isn't between generations but between different schools of thought and free market theory of money is very old idea which found itself in cyberspace.",CryptoCurrency,"Roubini, Krugman, Yellen oppose crypto, not because they are old, but because they are Keynesians"

Saw a post just now and thought it'd be good to tell the community a little about what's going on under the hood, instead of just swarming around the problem (which is real, validated, and generally acknowledged; though, you will find a few gems if you look hard enough). 

I'm also running on like very little sleep so apologies if I don't sound coherent in advance :)

Web3 games is a topic that I've researched a lot with my close group of friends! For purposes of showing that I'm not talking out of my butt hole, I'm a management consultant that's worked with an Eth cofounder on some stuff at a globally known firm, and my friends looking into this space with me are from the valley. We also have gaming backgrounds!

There are some insanely street smart individuals that not only did their research, but started executing just this year. They understood that players will generally prioritize playing fun games in the long-run, but once you throw in the ability to earn significant wealth, the tactical short-term decisions made by players start to differ person by person. Due to this, devs in this space end up making a semi-mutually exclusive choice: quick win vs long win. This is why you are seeing such a large disparity in the quality of games, from AAA like all the way down to crappy flash clones haha... Nonetheless, the big winners will be the ones currently designing great games first, and then considering blockchain applications second.

In our opinion, it's only a matter of time before web3 games become mainstream. Although the models being implemented today don't seem sustainable in the long-term, the core principle is there. The agency (alignment of interests) is just too much better than the current system for both players and game devs. You can argue that there has been a tactical failure on proper economic design/application, but to say the overall strategy/paradigm shift is bad would probably be incorrect (just based on Axie data ttm alone). Keep in mind that I'm not even diving into interoperability of games/IP yet, or how on-chain systems are better from a psychology and ops perspective (some really revolutionary things have yet to be discovered!).

So what's the optimal play here? We were personally working on a deadass simple platform that would allow any game dev to create an open economy (whether on or off-chain, with choice of token, NFT, or both) in less than 5 minutes. Our hypothesis was that great games already exist, so it's a matter of creating a bridge and trying to deepen current player experiences, instead of having to spend a year creating a new one.

Of course, before we started building this, we tried to sell to a few game devs (as players will follow).

The main problem? Education.

The amount of time spent having to teach them about how open economics would help their game didn't feel presently scalable. There's too much they haven't been exposed to, so the timing isn't quite there yet (4 years too early). This is why we believe the (really bad) current platforms that try to do this will fail or be useless until properly implemented blockchain games start blowing the traditional models out of market.

So now we're starting up a blockchain game shop and aiming to build said properly implemented blockchain games that will beat traditional games! Along the way, we're going to be abstracting our infrastructure to offer easy bridging for existing games (for when the time comes).

If you plan to HODL it for like 5 years at a 5% rate you Will get 1.05x1.05x1.05x1.05x1.05 = 1.27 1.27x100-100 = 27% in those 5 years. This is Just with 5% there are coins with 10% which Will result in even more coins!

 Staking can make a huge difference if you HOLD long term. So dont forget to stake.
There are a few ways to get free coins.

A) Flexible savings, for most coins like BTC which arent proof of stake, 1-3% a year.
B) Staking, proof of stake coins like ADA which can get you 5-15% per year! Really important!
C) Staking in DeFi, higher % higher Risk.

Especially if you are in here for long term maybe pick a coin that is proof to stake to get those extra coins. ETH Will also become POS(proof of stake) so its looking good!
You can either stake on An exchange or move your coins of the exchange keep Them in a cold wallet/software wallet and stake Them. Cold wallet is always more safe! Not your Keys not your coins!",CryptoCurrency,"If you are in it for long term, dont forget to STAKE YOUR COINS!"

[ So there we have it, to earn $1 you need to receive 69 \(nice...\) karma. With the number of users on r\/cc growing with every month, the ratio of moons to karma is falling with it. As a result, with each month it is almost certain that the amount of karma required to earn a moon will increase. The big unknown however is price.

People seem to think that crypto will put an end to banks, and so many other wacky things like redistribute wealth.... 

NO!

***Banks are going nowhere!*** They provide amazing services that people want and need. These services *CANNOT* be replaced by crypto, because crypto is incapable of replacing them.

So, what are these services that banks offer?

---

**Custody**

""Not your keys, not your coins"" is the worst advice I see around here. 

Yes, there are risks to keeping your coins on a ***reputable*** exchange/CeFi/ETF/Bank. 

For ***most people*** the risks of self custody are far higher. 99% of people are incapable of securely/durably storing their seed - and we should not be encouraging them to do so. Most people on these subreddits have it written down on some paper and hidden somewhere, and as someone with a background in IT security, that knowledge makes me feel ill.

Plenty of people are willing to take the risk of self custody, and that's fine. That's their choice - and it's great that crypto has given them this choice!

However, most people need and ***want*** institutions to look after their assets for them. This is why banks were created in the first place. This is why people currently use banks instead of hiding money under their mattress.

This is not bad. It's just a fact of human life. 

---

**Loans**

""DeFi is going to put banks out of business"" is another recent one. Thanks, Mark Cuban. 

DeFi is great, but it is *impossible* for it to replace Banks.

Why?

Almost all people who get loans from banks get loans because they don't have money. 

To get a loan on DeFi, you need collateral. ***MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE COLLATERAL.*** They live paycheck to paycheck. This means they cannot borrow anything on DeFi.

You cannot take out a $1m loan from DeFi to buy a house when you only have $100k collateral saved.

DeFi will have almost 0 impact on Bank loans, because it cannot offer anything similar.

DeFi will have a small impact on credit cards, because it cannot offer anything similar.

You need buildings full of workers, and debt collectors, and so on... to be able to offer loans like banks do. Crypto CANNOT compete with banks in this regard.

---

**Insurance / Reimbursement**

Banks (US/Australia/etc) have government assurances on your holdings. FDIC insures up to $250,000 *per bank* per person. This is a big deal.

If your credit card is compromised, you will also be reimbursed for fraudulent payments.

Banks will offer crypto accounts with similar to FDIC insurance, and crypto credit cards with the same fraud protections.

Without banks, you're shit out of luck when you lose your money - and seeing as most people are incapable of storing their seed, it's going to happen to a lot of people... it already is.

I want to share with you a google spreadsheet tracker I made. To be honest I think this one really rocks and I am excited to share it with you. Best part of all is that I did all the work for you, so that it's easy for you to use!

Here are is a picture of the dashboard

**Characteristics &amp; strenghts of the investment tracker**

* Can track both stocks &amp; crypto. Any crypto listed on coingecko. Any stocks which google finance can find.
* Allows subgroup analysis of your portfolio for stocks. You can create two categories, for example 'short-term investments' &amp; 'long-term investments' and compare their performance with each other. You can also name them 'dividend' and 'growth' stocks. Be creative.
* Tracks not only your current holdings, but also precise information on your past holdings. So for how much did you sell your last stock? Howmuch loss or gain? This allows you to reflect on past decisions and learn from them.
* Provides you with great graphical representation of your different holdings, exchanges, sector/industry, cost basis and more.
* Has additional tools to help you form your future decisions. One is the ""newsfeed"". With this newsfeed you can stay up to date with the click of a button. It provides you with the top 20 stories of either yahoo finance or seeking alpha for any stock you own. Alternatively, you can check out general cryptocurrency news.
* Another tool added to tracker is a screener. It extract data from finviz. Can help you decide if a stock you have been eye balling is worth a further look.

**Limitations of the investment tracker**

* Currently tracking more than 10 cryptocurrencies will signficantly slow down performance of the spreadsheet. This is because of limitations of importhtml/importxml functions. I am working on a solution for this.
* There are no adjustments for stock-split.
* Dividends are taken into account, but there is no 'dividend analysis'. For example, howmany dividends to you expect next month, etc.
* Return is calculated over 'one holding period'. This does not take into account cash flows. Better would be to use money-weighted-average return and compare this for example with a benchmark like NASDAQ or S&amp;P500.

Plan on improving all of these limitations in the future as well as work on other features such as a rebalancing tool.

The project gathered significant attention from the GitHub dev community, and have helped to make significant improvements to the original codebase, and I thought you guys might like it as well.

The code was built with customisability in mind, where each user can modify parameters like:

* Define what % increase constitues a buy signal
* Time elapsed between price checks
* Trailing stop loss / take profit
* Stop buying when the market is bearish

In addition to the core functionality, the algorithm is now able to receive and act on external signals which are fully customisable.

It uses data from Tradingview, and this returns buy signals according to the most relevant indicators. BY default if at least 18 out of 26 indicators agree that it's a good time to buy a certain coin, this will tell the bot to go buy that coin.

The bot also has a newly-implement pause functionality. It essentially analyses 15 moving average indicators and if half of them show that's a bearish market, the bot will not buy during this period.

You can also choose and pick any number of custom indicators from oscillators to moving averages and more. Those require a bit of coding, and I'm hoping to make it more user-friendly in the future but the core functionality is there.

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Everyone’s a genius in a bull market. Real traders can survive and even thrive in bear markets or highly volatile markets.

2 - Don’t be a blind bull. ALL markets are cyclical. Don’t be afraid of pullbacks or market crashes – that’s where you can make the most money.

3 - There’s a big difference between a trade and an investment.

4 - Fully plan your trade before you pull the trigger on the entry.

5 - Entries are important, but risk &amp; money management is where you make or lose money.

6 - Beware of get-rich-quick gurus hopping on the crypto bandwagon over the past year.

7 - Decide which types of trade setups or investments you’ll take and ignore everything else.

8 - Don’t assume just because you’ve made a lot of money in crypto that you can just as easily make money in other financial markets. 95%+ of stock market traders LOSE money. The game is rigged. Stick to what you know works for you.

9 - The best way to day trade cryptocurrencies is – DON’T!

10 - The best way to profit in any market is to find something you think has big potential early (before the general public catches on), and invest assuming you’re going to lose 100% of your capital. It’s the “angel investor” approach.

11 - You can’t control the market. The only thing you can control is your entries, trade size, and exits.

12 - One market participant can completely destroy “good technical analysis”.

13 - Don’t blindly follow trade alerts from ANYONE, especially random people on social media or chat rooms.

14 - All financial networking marketing projects are ponzi schemes, period.

15 - If you make a life-changing amount of money, do NOTHING for at least 30 days.

16 - Trading isn’t about picking exact tops and bottoms in a market – it’s about catching the meat of a move.

17 - Don’t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.

18 - Don’t set daily profit target goals – set long-term performance goals.

19 - Learn to survive, then thrive.

20 - The best charting indicators are price action and volume. You can use others, but it won’t necessarily make you a more profitable trader.

21 - Trends can go way past what seems rational.

22 - Don’t try to pick tops in a market. Wait for the market to tell you when the trend is over.

23 - Don’t trade in front of big news events – it’s impossible to predict how markets will react.

24 - The biggest challenge for most traders is their ego, or the need to be right.

25 - You can lose 50% of your trades and still be profitable if you manage risk properly.

26 - The best entrepreneurs and CEO’s typically make the worst traders and investors.

27 - People with the best mindset for investing typically have a career in high-risk situations like firefighters, pilots, police.

28 - Avoid pump and dump groups like the plague they are.

29 - You WILL make every mistake in the book. Don’t beat yourself up when you make mistakes, just learn and try not to make the same mistake twice.

30 - Don’t treat crypto exchanges like bank accounts. You don’t own the coins unless you control the private keys.

31 - Crypto is a 24/7/365 market. You can’t catch every trade. If you miss one, don’t worry – there’s ALWAYS another trade.

32 - Don’t invest in a coin unless you understand it inside out.

33 - You can make money trading the momentum and hype in shitcoins, just don’t invest long-term.

34 - Stay away from coins with low trading volume and low market caps. They are easily manipulated and you can get stuck in a position.

35 - Don’t trade with money you need for living expenses. It’s called “risk capital” for a reason.

36 - Think of yourself as a hunter – save your ammo for the big game.

37 - Crypocurrency exchanges go down when there’s high volatility. If price hits a major target or buy zone, it might make sense to place some orders BEFORE everyone else.

38 - Trading and investing brings all your emotions to the forefront – fear, greed, hesitation.

39 - The hardest thing to do in trading is… NOTHING. This can also be the most profitable thing to do.

40 - Just because a market is in a “bubble” doesn’t mean it’s going to die. Bitcoin has been through over half a dozen big bubbles and increased in price after each one.

41 - Manage your trades in a way that would leave you with no regrets no matter what the market does.

42 - Learn to think like a contrarian. If you’re someone who needs to have your opinion validated by everyone around you, then trading and investing isn’t for you.

43 - The shorter the chart time frame, the less reliable the chart patterns are. The longer the time frame, the more variables affect price action and the harder it becomes to predict price. My sweet spot in the daily chart for trade setups and 60-minute chart for entries.

44 - Some market conditions are great for pushing the gas on every trade setup you can find, where other market conditions call for you to slam on the brakes and step away from the markets altogether.

45 - 90%+ of cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero. Invest accordingly.

46 - The mental side of trading is the hardest to master, the most under-appreciated skill, and will cause you to make or lose the biggest amounts of money.

47 - The 3 biggest problems for traders are over-trading, hesitating on entries, and closing positions prior to profit targets when the trade is still intact.

48 - You can make a career’s worth of profit in one year or one trade – don’t feel like every day has to be a home run. Play the long game. Be patient and wait for the best plays.

49 - Don’t trust anyone else to trade for you. Manage your own high-risk investments (like crypto trading) or don’t participate at all.

50 - Take the news for what it is – they’re trying to get views and clicks. They’re NOT looking out for your best interests or trying to help you make money.",CryptoCurrency,50 Crypto Trading &amp; Investing Lessons Learned Over The Past 8 Years

**REASONS**

The fundamental cause of the phenomenon of alt-coin season can be traced back to Bitcoin. It's massive market cap and dominance relative to the rest of the crypto market creates a high influence factor on alt-coins, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. This is where the phrase 'whatever Bitcoin does, alt-coins do' comes into light, because it's simply the market influence that causes such a likeliness in both Bitcoin and alt-coin trends. 

What causes these specific alt-coins seasons however, can be traced to momentum shifts within Bitcoin (Fig. 3). Everything was going well for Bitcoin for a few months, causing a sustained market momentum tunnel. However, once Bitcoin had broken the Wyckoff distributive pattern and fell off its market trend, due to market momentum lag as previously demonstrated in Fig. 2, the overall crypto market still followed its tunnelled trend for a few weeks. 

However, with alt-coins looped in a tunnel trend and Bitcoin down 45%, the usual market cash influx was disrupted. Instead of Bitcoin soaking investor money, most of that cash went to alt-coins instead due to a greater dominance as a result of Bitcoin correcting and the power void left from it. This shift in market momentum was why although market-cap still kept pace, many coins like Ethereum and Cardano (ADA) 2x'ed in a matter of weeks. For purely comparison's sake, Fig. 4 depicts such movement.

**AFTERMATH**

The aftermath of such alt-coin season was a ugly one to say the least. This pump was unsustainable because it relied on a power gap and a differential in Bitcoin dominance, not a more economically sustainable factor such as institutionalized interest or mass-adoption for instance. As a result, naturally, the power bubble collapsed, leaving many alt-coins in the dirt.

This being said, any further alt-coin seasons reliant on such an unsustainable factor should be perceived with suspicion, especially if it has to do with messing around with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is king in the market, not because of technology or use cases, but because of its inherent power it welds with such a large market cap, although in the later years, this might be subject to change. However, this is also why it acts like such a good hedge against short-term bear markets, because when the cash also flows *back into* Bitcoin in times of strife due to the reliance on such a stable market dominance. More of this on future posts though.

  
**TO CONCLUDE**

It is quintessential for any investor to realize such patterns. These trends inherit to cryptography and economic structure can become powerful tools when analysing different alt-coins. Although this isn't the most in-depth explanation of the economy behind alt-coins, I hope this has at least made a difference your understanding, or in what most retail investors now call 'tokenomics'. A jazzy term to say the least lol.

The move brings Yieldly Bridges to an estimated 600,000 Ethereum users

As denoted by their name, technologies like Yieldly’s build bridges between blockchains, and in this case allows them to utilize the Algorand Protocol and Yieldly’s DeFi products. The process begins with an ERC20 bridge, which connects Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)-based tokens and the ERC-20 ecosystem. Also on the to-do list are more bridges for ASA native token holders which the platform hopes will drive liquidity and adoption

This bridge facilitates cross-chain staking for ASA, ERC-20,  BEP-2, and BEP-20, along with other emerging cryptocurrency protocols, including Polygon’s POLY standard. It will also be a fiat on/off-ramp.
The bridge will also serve as a fiat on/off ramp, providing additional functionality for DeFi users. It will absorb YLDY in an ERC-20 wrapper which can then be transferred to Ethereum where it can be deployed in a number of ways.

“Our recent IDO with Trustswap really demonstrates that there is untapped demand for ETH holders to port tokens out of the Ethereum ecosystem and open up new opportunities in the broader DeFi sector,” Sebastian Quinn, cofounder of Yieldly, said. “In addition, the vast majority of people from the IDO — around 80 per cent — have staked their Yieldly on our platform, showing it’s not just being held to sell later, but to be used on the platform.”

You start a relationship after a few dates (maybe reading the relevant subreddit or your chosen token, seeing it in a discord). You start off small, a few dates (a little bag).

As you see each other more, you get more invested, you start to develop feelings and move into a proper relationship based off of your legitimate feelings and your hours of courtship research (due diligence). 

The longer you spend together (hopefully) the more assured you become. Having done your due diligence you know that this will be of long term benefit to you both and you have faith in your relationship (you're now a certified shill). You don't need it to be tested daily or show you that it's going well every day (you free yourselves from checking the graph daily, it's of no relevance to you now). 

When you're committed, you are sure enough of your conviction that through the bad and good you still hold firm. If you have a big row and they storm out (or your holdings crash 20/30%), you might get a bit upset but you know long term it's not worth bailing ship.

It wasn't simply the invention of the steam engine that started this - arguably - biggest shift in economy, society and politics of all times. Without two other major innovations it would have never had the chance to disrupt the way how we live, produce and consume.

In order for the really big changes to take place we need three ingredients:

1. A new way to produce stuff (i.e. the technological innovation with the invention of the steam engine)
2. A new way to exchange information about stuff (i.e. the information innovation with the invention of the printing press)
3. A new way to pay for stuff (i.e. the monetary innovation with the invention of paper and/or book money)

Last time, the information innovation happened first (15th century), then the monetary innovation (17th century) and last the technological innovation (18th century). This time, it's the other way around. First, computers helped us to automate tasks (technological innovation). Then, roughly 30 years ago the internet (www) helped us to exchange information at costs and a speed never seen before (information revolution). And since roughly 13 years, we have the digital money to pay (monetary innovation).

So, it seems like we have all the ingredients together again. I know humans are terribly bad in thinking in exponential terms. But just mentally travel back 20 years and imagine what live has been back then. And how different it is today. In just these two decades we have moved most aspects of our lives into the digital realm. What missed, however, was a technology that regulated ownership rights of digital goods without giving that power to a middleman who could take advantage of this trust.

This has changed now. Ever since the invention of Blockchain and its first major use case (cryptocurrencies) we can truly control ownership of our digital goods by ourselves. Cryptocurrencies were just the start. We're now increasingly starting to use that same technology to govern ownership rights for every kind of digital ""good"". Also our highly unique and personal ones (like music, pictures, art, texts, ...). This is where NFTs and the Metaverse come into the picture.

The next 20 years will be HUGE. Buckle up! We're in for a wild ride.

I dont have to go to a tropical paradise, even though I could afford to stay on one for a few years atleast. I have not cashed out completely from crypto, I dont plan to do either. The thought of not having any crypto alone makes me sick, also it would require me to give away 30% of my capital to the government for doing fuck all. The govt literally hindered crypto in every possible way, fudded it to death at times, called it a scam and other terms.... and now wants to get paid a nice chunk from the risk I bore entirely. Well they can get bent

I am looking forward to more countries accepting crypto as tender, removing capital gains and accepting citizenship with it. El Salvador is a great start, and 3 BTC for its citizenship sounds great, even though it could be considered a high risk country to migrate to. When another country like Trinidad &amp; Tobago decides it needs BTC, because it feels the pinch of inflation and economic slowdown.. a ton more people will migrate there.

To get the Moons to Karma ratio, I simply divide the Moons to be distributed this round by a value I see in a chart \[c01\] above.

Terms used:

* total\_daily\_comments: cumulative number of comments in all Dailies for a particular round
* total\_daily\_scores: cumulative score of all Dailies for a particular round

One post in particular argued that centralisation is needed from the start of a project's journey to encourage development. I believe that decentralisation is the **ONLY** point of crypto and should be sought out as a priority and not be a future promise. 

Crypto has so many comparable non-crypto centralised alternatives, which can provide the same features. Here is a small list of features that crypto can offer, and a centralised/non-crypto alternative:

* Store of Value - Gold/Silver/general commodities
* Transfer of money - PayPal/CashApp/Payoneer
* Yield products - Bonds/Some investment trusts/REITs
* Investment opportunities - Stock market/Private Equity/Fine Art
* NFTs - ownership papers
* Privacy - Cash (admittedly weak, I’m not an XMR shill I promise)

I’m sure I’m missing a few, but my point is that one can access all of these features in a centralised manner. What crypto offers is the ability to access all of these features in a trustless way. I.e. You no longer rely on PayPal to “allow” you to send and withdraw money, it is all done by the network instead. The only differentiating factor between these centralised options and crypto is that crypto does not rely on companies/middle men.

**All other features of a crypto, say fast speed, low fees, and any other great technical advancements, are just a means to make the decentralised product better, but are not the main feature by any means.**

Take BTC. It sits at #1 because it is the best store of value of any crypto, but the reason it has any value in the first place is because it is decentralised.",CryptoCurrency,Decentralisation is the ONLY point of crypto and should be a priority in any investment

Bitcoin has nearly a trillion dollar market cap and is the 9th most valuable asset in the world. I wouldn't call that being ""early"" anymore. Ethereum is #20. Large companies are now buying these assets. The days of 100x your money in a year is basically over. As for the shitcoins that do do that, look at the volume at the start. Barely anyone was trading back then.

Do I think there is still a lot of room for crypto to grow? Yes, but this isn't 2011 anymore. Most people who buy now aren't going to make insane gains and that's just the truth of it. There are \~18,000 shitcoins in existence now, back in 2011 there were maybe 5. And the industry just started back then, now it's been around for 12 years. Much different ballgame now than it was back then. I'd say we are somewhere in the middle. Big gains can still be made but don't make the mistake of thinking this is 2011 and expecting a 1000x in one year.

Edit: clearly people missed the point. We are relatively early, but the way some people are talking, they think they can turn $1,000 into $1,000,000. We are at a level where I could reasonably see most coins doing a 10-20X in 10 years.

1629499658,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p8fsp9/yes_ive_been_in_crypto_for_more_than_5_years_and/,670,260,"There is a post on the front page currently which states you should be rich from crypto if you’ve been in it for a few years. Let me tell you why you don’t understand. Some of have made many mistakes. The silver lining is that some of us learn from our mistakes. 

My diamond hands were forged in the fires of repeated failures to hodl. Us old timers can show you the way.

?2009 - I was hearing about crypto. Seems like people were using it for darkweb stuff. Not interested. 

2013/2014 - I have money enough to invest here and there (small amounts), looked into buying. I came to the conclusion that mining was too hard. Literally told my friend “the bitcoin ship has sailed”

It was different back then. This is a tech thing and it didn’t really have financial people in it. Not many people understood what the market might do. Those visionaries that did were people like Vitalik. Some of us are not on that level.  

2014 - been reading about it enough to finally invest something. Started with $1000. When I started you literally had to wire money to some shady bank account. Or meet up and swab USBs or keys with someone. It took days to get in and out sometimes. At various points, banks would close your account if they saw you sending money to exchanges. $1000 was more like $900 by the time I’d transferred to the US and then it was converted to usd was maybe 700. Enough to buy 1.5 btc roughly. 

I was buying it when a bunch of places were still calling it - from memory - XBT - naming hadn’t even been sorted out.

2015 I sold. $500 per coin, sure, but watch bitcoin NOT move in price after a year or two. Exchanges would collapse after not long ([Mt Gox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) - which was handling 70% of volume - imagine if binance and coinbase got hacked… yea you’d consider selling too). I went through old emails from me to friends and family after I found out about bitcoin and did my research, I told everyone. No one supported me. NO ONE. When you’re met with resistance from many different quarters from people you respect and who are themselves finically successful, who is a kid to stand up to that? I think if you’d grown up in San Francisco with flying cars and personal assistant robots maybe it would be easier to have lived and seen technology change the world, seeing saw start ups etc. 

Back to New Zealand, living in a country where no one ever spoke about this shit other than to deride it was a totally different time. Add into that you buy btc but it doesn’t appreciate in price for a year or two and you watch exchanges fail one by one… you start to say “I guess I could use the money elsewhere, like paying bills”. I wasn’t engaged with the Reddit community much then and there was a feeling you really shouldn’t trust magic internet money. 

So, after watching Mt Gox fail, seeing the US at the time taking quite a negative stance on crypto people were thinking it’s just dodgy internet money for the dark web. It was a very negative time. For those of us who were open minded enough to get in early there were many quite reasonable rationalisations as to why it would fail. 

History repeats. Come 2017 things went well for a bit, bought in just before it went crazy. Heard about Raiblocks (now called nano) and thought this tech could change the world. Then I bought Raiblocks/nano all the way up thinking it was an amazing technology. But I bought it on bitgrail. Then “we suffered a stolen”. I lost everything. Maybe not much if you’re a whale and I was investing spare money but I went in pretty aggressively. You had to buy the random tokens off some random sites as they weren’t on the main exchanges. Yes, shouldn’t have bought from that exchange - I know. Some of us lost big. Some whales were made. It hasn’t all been sunshine and roses. It’s been hard and lots of us have made many mistakes. Those who succeeded were also lucky. I just happened to avoid Mt Gox the first time.

It’s easy to see how crypto is the future now. But you’re using the current situation to judge how it felt back then. Loads of people lost keys, the bought and sold and used it for buying random shit off Silk Road. Not many thought it would be the future of money. I thought it had a future back then but didn’t really know about investing. 

Point is: if you invest when it’s risky you win big. If you invest once it’s a sure thing you’re going to have less potential rewards and less potential risks. Stick to the rules in crypto. Only invest what you can lose. Mistakes are how you learn. Cold wallets. Not your keys not your coins. Many of us are using this path as a way to potential financial independence, we should be helping one another and enjoying the ride.

Good luck everyone!

Edit: one thought I had after writing this was buying crypto for me back in the day would be like buying some random altcoin right now. Just pick one randomly and put your money on it. Pretty scary! That was how unknown it seemed to me at the time when I first was reading about crypto.

Second edit: I forgot about matic (polygon) - bought in 2019 at 2c, ran into financial difficulties with a project in the real world, had to sell, it mooned to 2.80 at one point. I’ve come to terms with it. Another one that would have made me a millionaire. Lol. Amongst my friends who invested early (started having crypto group chats 2017 or so) most of us have some horror stories like this. Nowadays, I buy and hodl. 

Tldr: hodling is hard. I’m pretty typical for those who got in early. Lots of us screwed up. Don’t worry, you have time.

In comparison, btc is up 38% and eth 67%. Overall, these coins have resulted in gains of 100.77%. However, this was mostly a consequence of PBR and GSWAP performing so well. Generally, I am quite surprised by how well most coins recovered after the crash in summer and am curious to see how they will continue to develop in a longer period of time. 

Most of these coins had a market cap smaller than 100 mil when I got them, but I think it would have been more profitable to get some 1bn+ coins instead. Anyways, quite a cool experiment that I think you guys might find interesting.

Have you gotten any cool small market cap coins after the crash?",CryptoCurrency,I bought 30 small market cap coins in June. Here are the results!

 My projecta are:


 1) OPCT Opacity Storage

 It's a private cloud storage provider.. they are focused on the protection of our Privacy. No e-mail and personal informations are required to use the service.
 ‌The goal is a mass adoption of the service (you can try it also for free and it is very simple to use)
 ‌The service can be used also as bridge to others decentralized service (for example Sia integration is near the corner.

 Tomorrow its CEO Jason Coppola will do AMA session with Polygon..

 News and Updates?
 - mobile App release.. For me this will be a gate for a mass adoption of the service, so I think this is a Milestone for the project
 - Siacoin integration... As reported Opacity can be be used also as bridge to other decetralized projects
 - and, I'm sure that a new CEX will be announced

 Project has still a low market cap...


 2) RNB Rentible - A first-mover dApp for mid-to-long term property rentals, where tenants and landlords can send / receive rent payments in different cryptocurrencies.

 Rentible is focused of mid to long rent and has an easy to use approach for a mass adoption of the platform.

 Team has already announced the launch of platform within end of year in Latin American Countries

 Other news and updateds:

 - platform will also have a marketplace for rent, buy and sell metaverse Properties
 - New local CEX
 - bridge for BSC Chain
 - partnerships with Real Estate Companies

 At the moment has only 5 Million market cap with a total supply of 3,5Million of RNB

A lot of people are saying: 'Take profits, take profits, you never know when the next dip is' but this is timing the market which I don't know how to do. I don't want to take money out which would exponentially make me lose profits on the way up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Others are saying: 'never touch your bags until your target is achieved' but I wouldn't want to empty everything as soon as my target is achieved. Yes I'd like to buy a house or a flat at some point in my life and I'm very very far from there right now BUT I won't empty everything as soon as I have enough for a house. This would be counter productive.   


When I'm in the red the solution is easy. Buy, buy, buy so you can average down. Nowadays the feeling of buying is different because I'm buying while already in the profits.   


The only solution I found is to think I'm averaging up so that at the next dip I can really average down but it doesn't make much sense. This is why people blindly dca'ing have a better time. The decision making is very complicated.

MOONs are the **community points** that you can earn by participating in this subreddit. Community points are a unit of ownership, they can be spent on premium features and are used as a measure of reputation in the community. Moons are distributed monthly based on comment and post karma, but you can also get them as a gift or you can buy them with Nano (see resources). 

&amp;nbsp;

###MOON stats

Current Supply | Price ($) | Marketcap ($)
---------|----------|----------
51501572 | 0.13 | 6695204


&amp;nbsp;

###Why are MOONs mooning

There are several reasons why MOONs have recently been going up in price. First of all, MOON are becoming more and more scarce. A month or 2 ago you'd still get around 6 MOON per karma, but with the latest distribution that dropped down to around 0.875 MOON per karma. Another thing that is causing the price to increase is a [recently approved proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kj2ij0/poll_bonus_karma_for_people_that_keep_moons_in/) that people can earn up to 20% extra MOON per distribution if they hold their MOON in their vault. A third reason for the rise in price is that MOONs were recently [ported to Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xe1ca72ff3434b131765c62cbcbc26060f7aba03d) and therefore increasing accessibility. One more reason is that [Reddit announced their partnership with the Ethereum foundation last week.](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l6c3kx/reddit_announces_partnership_with_the_ethereum/). This brings MOON closer to being on the mainnet, which is suppose to happen early this year. Launching on the mainnet would also open up the possibility for the exchange listing of MOONs. People have been speculating that such events could easily increase the price of one MOON to $0,50 or even $1, since that would still leave us with a small marketcap (not even top 400 on coinmarketcap). /u/Ovv_Topik also correctly pointed out that we've also had a huge influx of new members in the last week or two, just discovering MOONs, and wanting in!

ETH has enabled a few totally new things that really are revolutionary to the crypto space including:

1.	‘stablecoins’, or more generally 'tokenized assets', cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of another asset, like the US dollar. (eg USDT/Tether, USDC, Dai) This allows crypto users to easily exchange their more volatile assets such as ethereum or any other ‘ERC-20’ token (basically a token created using ethereum and exists on the ethereum blockchain), into one that reliably maintains its value, while still having all the advantages of having a blockchain asset (eg secure, global, permissionless transactions).
2.	Decentralized, smart contract-based trading platforms, allowing users to trade while still maintaining full self-custody of their private keys unlike on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. In other words you always maintain control of your coins, instead of needing to send your coins to the exchange to trade them. On top of that they never have any downtime during volatile markets like centralized exchanges. They also can't stop you from trading \*cough cough\* ^(robinhood)
3.	The development of decentralized, peer-to-peer lending/borrowing platforms. This allows users to earn interest on their cryptos or borrow cryptos. These loans are quite low risk due to them being overcollateralized loans, meaning that to take out a loan, you must post collateral, in the form of other crytpocurrencies that is more valuable than what you are borrowing. This means that people can invest in crypto in a low risk way, lending out stablecoins can yield &gt;5% annual returns which, while much lower than what is possible with higher risk crypto investments, is still quite high given the risk profile, easily 10x the annual return of a savings account at a bank.

These three things constitute a large part of what we call ‘decentralized finance’ or DeFi and right now they only really exist on the ethereum blockchain. Right now there is one major problem for both bitcoin and ethereum, scalability. Essentially, transaction fees are obsurdly high making it cost-prohibitive for most people to take advantage of these amazing new features. The good thing is, over the course of the next 1-2 years (potentially even in the coming weeks), we will be seeing the implementation of several major solutions to this for ethereum. Namely 'Layer 2' (L2) solutions (aka off-chain solutions),  these allow users to make ethereum based transactions off the ethereum blockchain and onto a platform that can handle more transactions. The other solution to the scaling problem is ethereum 2.0. This is an improvement to the ethereum platform itself, making on-chain (as opposed to off-chain, L2) transactions much more effecient. With these solutions in place, we could be seeing transaction fees at &lt;$0.01 and transaction speeds in &lt;1 second. Unfortunately, at least in my view, we don't have the level of concrete development in this area of bitcoin, making the prospect of bitcoin scaling less likely to be coming soon.

So as you can see, the future for ethereum is very exciting, and the things I mentioned really just scratch the surface in what is possible with ethereum.

There are quite a few users who have spilt over in to our subreddit from wallstreetbets and the dogecoin sub and god knows where else. After seeing this not only happen with a coin that was designed as a MEME and nothing more and then happening with XRP, I feel like there is an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed.                 

[please read this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kp6s43/inside_a_pumpanddump_group_the_deception_the_con/) on how a pump and dump group operates. If you don't have time, the TL;DR is - they buy tokens / coins anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the head of the group tells everyone to pump a coin. Then they dump their coins without telling you. They claim you get ""insider"" information if you give them 0.01 BTC or invite 30 people to the group.                  

#**Pay attention to these fundamentals:**                
1. It doesn't actually matter if there is a cryptocurrency that is more efficient, more secure, faster, or better in general because....               
2. You will not see people who mined bitcoin for nearly free in 2010, or bought it at 10 cents each, 1 dollar each, 10 dollars each, 100 dollars each, or 1000 dollars each dumping at 34,000 USD for a token that almost no one has heard of. Even if such a thing existed, you couldn't get everyone to agree on when / how to dump their bitcoin for ""something better"", this was tried with bitcoin cash and the market has spoken.               
3. Financial institutions aren't interested in anything except bitcoin right now (and are **much less interested in something the SEC has legal issues with**) because it functions as a hedge against inflation and it has verifiable scarcity.                 
4. You need to pay attention to **market capitalization** (market cap for short) of a cryptocurrency. Go to coingecko.com. Check out the market cap of your ""coin"" and then compare it to bitcoin's marketcap. In order for it to surpass ethereum it needs to get 130 billion USD of fresh capital quickly. If it wants to get past bitcoin, it needs to get at least 600 billion USD of new capital. with that in mind...                 
5. If your token is under 50 cents but it's in the top 100, do the math and figure out how / what it would need to get ""past bitcoin"". Just because it's ""cheaper than bitcoin"" doesn't mean everyone wants to buy it.

I found a couple of great articles about chasing pumps or day trading in general that I wanted to share. These were written before the shitshow that is happening in stock/crypto markets this past month, but the principals stay the same:

*1st article:*
https://vantagepointtrading.com/whats-the-day-trading-success-rate-the-thorough-answer/

""While anyone can be successful, most people who enter the trading world don’t have the discipline and patience to practice a strategy (or set of strategies) until those strategies produce a consistent profit. While people are told they won’t be successful overnight, most new traders don’t actually believe that. They have an idea in their head that they’re smarter than everyone else and will make money quickly. Nope. You may make the “standard” 10% per year or so…but it’s pretty tough to make a living on a $30,000 account making 10% a year. We Day traders need more.

You may have heard 90% or 95% of traders lose money, or some other seemingly high statistic. From what I’ve personally seen, this is accurate. While I traded for a day trading firm, about 10 people came in every couple months for trader training, or about 60 per year. For a five-year period that means about 300 people came to the trading firm and took (or at least started) the training program. Some traders I talked with think the actual number is higher; that is was closer to 400 people.

Only 14 (women and men, including myself) moved on to become regular traders, producing consistent profits for at least several years. That’s about a 3.5% to 4.5% success rate. Approximately another 10 made money, but not enough to keep them trading. If success is defined as just being negligibly profitable (for at least a couple months) the success rate is about 6% to 8%. But who wants to trade to just break even?""

*2nd article*
https://tradeciety.com/24-statistics-why-most-traders-lose-money/

""Scientist Discovered Why Most Traders Lose Money – 24 Surprising Statistics

“95% of all traders fail” is the most commonly used trading related statistic around the internet. But no research paper exists that proves this number right. Research even suggests that the actual figure is much, much higher. In the following article we’ll show you 24 very surprising statistics economic scientists discovered by analyzing actual broker data and the performance of traders. Some explain very well why most traders lose money.

1 - 80% of all day traders quit within the first two years.

2 - Among all day traders, nearly 40% day trade for only one month. Within three years, only 13% continue to day trade. After five years, only 7% remain.

3 - Traders sell winners at a 50% higher rate than losers. 60% of sales are winners, while 40% of sales are losers.

4 - The average individual investor under performs a market index by 1.5% per year. Active traders under perform by 6.5% annually.

5 - Day traders with strong past performance go on to earn strong returns in the future. Though only about 1% of all day traders are able to predictably profit net of fees.

6 - Traders with up to a 10 years negative track record continue to trade. This suggest that day traders even continue to trade when they receive a negative signal regarding their ability.

7 - Profitable day traders make up a small proportion of all traders – 1.6% in the average year. However, these day traders are very active – accounting for 12% of all day trading activity.

8 - Among all traders, profitable traders increase their trading more than unprofitable day traders.""

I personally support this project because I know the burdens and fees of having to send money outside of the US and I appreciate what Stellar Development Foundation is working on.

Created in 2014 after bitcoin but before Ethereum, launched in 2015 by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit company based in the U.S. It is designed so all the world’s financial systems can work together on a single network. Intended to enhance rather than undermine or replace the existing financial system. 

Stellar enables a future where everyday people can send money anywhere affordably and quickly. Like any payments system, Stellar allows one user to send currency to another. User A can send User B dollar tokens or lumens or whatever. But Stellar also allows a user to send one currency and have the recipient receive another. Essentially, you can send and exchange money in a single atomic transaction. 

Each year, over $500 billion of value is transferred cross-border through personal remittances. In most cases, remittances are transfers of money from foreign workers to family members in their home country, sent on a monthly basis. The typical transaction is $200 to $300 and the average retail cost of these transfers runs 7-8%, usually collected in cash. Sending costs can be as high as 15% when transferring money to people in developing economies. 

Unlike the tokens of other blockchains, lumens aren’t mined or awarded by the protocol over time. Instead, 100 billion lumens were created when the Stellar network went live, and for the first 5 or so years of Stellar’s existence, the supply of lumens also increased by 1% annually, by design. That inflation mechanism was ended by community vote in October 2019. And in November 2019, the overall lumen supply was reduced. Now there are about 50 billion lumens, total, in existence, and no more lumens will be created. Nearly 20 billion lumens are out in the open market, and the Stellar Development Foundation retains the other 30 billion or so to develop and promote Stellar, per its mandate. Those lumens will enter the public markets over the next few years.

1612197716,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/la7i3u/why_im_so_enthusiastic_about_nano_and_why_you/,492,252,"This is a longread, so **tl;dr** \- Nano's UX and fundamentals are incredible (try it out yourself), has a large (developer) community around it, and also has a lot of price upside.

So it seems that despite having commented about Nano fairly often on this subreddit I've never laid out just why I'm so enthusiastic about Nano. So in this post - my reason for being so enthusiastic about Nano, how you can try Nano out within 2 minutes, and what the future for Nano might be like.

# Why am I so enthusiastic about Nano?

I got into crypto because I believe in having a decentralised digital currency. I believe that a future in which all people have direct access to an undebaseable, self-sovereign currency is a far better future than a future in which we are bound to using fiat currencies to pay.

I believe Nano is the currency that stands the best chance at being this decentralised digital currency. I'm in agreement with Elon Musk that when it comes to currencies, ""[whichever has least error &amp; latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)"". There needs to be as little friction as possible in currencies as possible - in terms of latency, throughput, and fees. How does Nano fit in here? Well, Nano's fundamentals are as follows:

* [Lowest latency cryptocurrency](https://nanocrawler.cc/network) (0.15 seconds to fully confirm, on average)
* Zero fees - no leeching middlemen ([I explain how no fees means no centralisation yet gives plenty incentives here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/la7i3u/why_im_so_enthusiastic_about_nano_and_why_you/glpeyfv/))
* Incredibly secure - deterministic finality versus the probabilistic finality of traditional cryptocurrencies
* Has never had a double spend, re-organisation, or inflation bug
* Had a [third party security audit](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/nano-protocol-security-audit-summary-and-full-report-48760be8ab3d)
* No inflation - fully distributed
* Incredibly energy efficient/green - the entire network can run on roughly one windmill
* High throughput ([200 CPS+ in latest stresstests](https://forum.nano.org/t/nano-stress-tests-measuring-bps-cps-tps-in-the-real-world/436)), still improving passively by scaling through hardware and actively through development.
* Usable as an method of exchange (i.e. directly spendable) - that  means that early whales won't all have to ""cash out"" to take profits,  they really could use it for goods/services directly

I understand that these are lofty claims, and that they sound unbelievable. However, all of these can be verified either through the [Nano protocol/website](https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/) or through links I've added. A more practical approach would be to verify the low latency, feelessness and great user experience for yourself by taking two minutes to try it out.

# How to try out Nano

1. Install Natrium ([Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.banano.natriumwallet), [iOS here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/natrium/id1451425707?ls=1&amp;mt=8)).
2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://nano-faucet.org/).
3. Fill in your Nano\_ address and hit send.

That's all! To really try it out I'd recommend getting a second wallet such as [Nault (web-based)](https://nault.cc/) or Nalli ([Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.heimo.nalli),[ iOS here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1515601975)),  then sending some Nano from your first wallet to the second.

I think trying it out is the single best way to experience the user experience/speed that we Nano enthusiasts are always raving about. I also believe that, given that it takes just two minutes, it's worth taking some time out of your day to verify or disprove these claims that are so often made. I've tried my fair share of cryptos and wallets, and I can tell you I have never seen a crypto-related user experience that can compete with using Natrium to send and receive NANO.

If I'm right, then Nano might be an incredible opportunity. If I'm wrong, then you can discount these Nano claims from now on and save yourself a lot of time.

**Wait, people are giving Nano away for free?**

Yes, many people are just **that** enthusiastic about Nano. I think that practically everyone here on r/cc can attest to the fact that Nano enthusiasts are a very big group, and a very active group.

[I couldn't resist adding this in here.](https://preview.redd.it/dg3787bvaue61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab31fa3c87993bd114f9915543a7faca8dd64e58)

It's not just r/cc though. A different crypto subreddit recently (literally) had their entire hot page filled with Nano posts, r/nanocurrency is an incredibly active subreddit, and even on other subreddits around Reddit you'll often run into Nano posts and comments. The same holds true for Twitter - Nano is consistently in the top 3 most talked about cryptocurrencies on Twitter.

Luckily though, it's not just a bunch of shills and enthusiasts. Nano also has a very large developer community around it building awesome stuff on Nano. The Natrium wallet was named before, but there's also a [great web/desktop wallet in Nault](https://nault.cc/), the awesome [Nalli wallet](https://nalli.app/) that allows you to send Nano to anyone using their phone number, and even recently got [the first cryptocurrency wallet for KaiOS](https://kaiak.cc/), the second largest mobile OS in India and many developing countries.

On top of that, there are Nano TipBots for practically every platform, such as for [Reddit](https://github.com/danhitchcock/nano_tipper_z)/[Twitter/Telegram](https://nanotipbot.com/)/[Whatsapp](https://thenanobot.com/), and there is so much development happening that it's [just too much to list in this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/kkgq8h/looking_back_on_a_year_of_nano_development/). One more thing I'd like to point out is [WeNano](https://wenano.net/), a newer app that functions as a wallet and allows users to create hotspots that grant free Nano to others based on their location. It's like Pokemon Go, but then for crypto. WeNano has already exploded in use worldwide, especially in 3rd world countries where these undebaseable, self-sovereign currencies are needed most.

**This all sounds pretty fantastic so.. why has the price been declining?**

To be fair, the price has roughly quadrupled since a month ago. But it's true, Nano had a huge run-up in 2017 peaking at $30+ shortly. The bull market ended shortly thereafter, and Nano had a massive decline of nearly 99% over the next couple of years, not exactly helped by one of the two exchanges on which Nano was traded having a double withdraw bug + an exit-scamming exchange owner.

Things have begun to change. NANO bottomed out with the rest of the crypto space, went through a healthy accumulation phase, and has since begun showing signs of life yet again. It's been going up a fair bit lately, and more importantly Nano is experiencing a massive increase in interest. It's actually the reason I've been less active in r/cc \- I literally cannot keep up with all the DMs, Discord messages, chats and questions elsewhere I get about Nano. This is no hard data, but I'm pretty sure I alone have sent to over 300 newly opened wallets this past weekend because people wanted to try Nano out, and the faucets are seeing a surge in use as well.

**So what is the price upside here?**

I think I've described well enough why this is exciting from the perspective of someone interested in the tech and wanting to have a global decentralised digital currency, but what is the price potential here? To be honest, I am loath to do price forecasts, so here are some reasons I think Nano will go up, strongly, in the near future, without having an idea as to how much this will be.

**Exchanges.** Nano recently got listed on some exchanges (BitcoinSuisse for institutional investors, AnchorUSD for a direct USD gateway + exchanges in Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia) but *still* isn't listed on **Coinbase**. The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. This could be a coincidence, but it's positive either way. Additionally, in another showing of Nano's big community, the post requesting Nano be added to Coinbase is now the [all-time most upvoted post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/l8lcwl/is_nano_cryptocurrency_planned_to_be_added_on/) on r/coinbase. Plus, Garry Tan, one of the early investors is [presumably still invested in Nano](https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1231029507638693889). Another exchange that could list Nano is **Gemini,** and the good news here is that the twins have recently gotten more interested in Nano in the sense that they're liking Nano posts on Twitter. Thin proof, but it's something!

The most hopium part of all is of course Elon Musk. His [least error &amp; latency](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) post combined with him looking into crypto makes me hope that he'll run across Nano and try it out. The Nano community has recently developed a knack for getting their posts in front of people they want to know about Nano ([see also Raoul Pal](https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1353531308748767234)), and it's my hope this also gets the ultimate first principles engineer to give Nano a look [through this tweetstorm.](https://twitter.com/mira_hurley/status/1356277209212858371)

In essence, my thinking here - Nano has extremely good fundamentals, a large and enthusiastic (developer) community, a lot of price upside, hence is worth a look for anyone regardless of what got you into cryptocurrency.

Spoiler Alert: I actually surveyed 181 /r/CryptoCurrency Redditors, but a nice round number always sounds better! 

Last week I posted a short survey to gather some information about /r/CryptoCurrency users that I could turn into some funky graphs. I now have the final results and must say some really surprised me.

I'd love to do another one of these again with a larger sample size, so if you have any question suggestions, please drop them below!

&amp;#x200B;

**Q1 -  When did you first hear about Cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see from the results above, during 2013 &amp; 2017 \(bull market years\) there is an increase in users discovering Cryptocurrency. Which makes sense as these are the years where media coverage is at its highest. What surprised me about this result is that I also expected the same for 2020 \(or at least a higher result\) however this was not the case. ](https://preview.redd.it/zoaf0i8gzte61.png?width=911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baff219f1157fb99a89f511c88dc3572cb821d93)

**Q2 -  When did you first invest in Cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[As you can see from the above, there is steadily increasing growth \(roughly\) year on year with the exceptions of 2017 and 2020. This makes sense as these are the years where talk about Crypto &amp; FOMO is at its highest. However I was interested to see that 38&amp;#37; of people surveyed invested in 2020, however less than 1&amp;#37; heard about Crypto for the first time in 2020. Meaning there could be a year\/multi year gap between the average \/r\/cryptocurrency member discovering Crypto &amp; investing in it for the first time. ](https://preview.redd.it/763txvpp0ue61.png?width=972&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d975373b7b15fe29e70484d21f8935ac9e22a5)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q3 -  Have you ever mined cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I think this one is fairly straight forward, and just about what I was expecting. ](https://preview.redd.it/xtiur6sm1ue61.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc67c5e1844b1ae7fa9eef1ec138d6b4a782f41)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q4 -  Have you ever staked cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I initially was surprised by this as far more people had staked compared to mining and I personally couldn't remember a time where I had staked Crypto, however I did remember that one of Coinbase Earn's lessons was actually a tutorial where they provide you some COMP for you to stake. This made me realise that it had been so easy, I'd forgotten I'd even done it!  - I think that with staking becoming easier and easier and more accessible to the average user, this figure is bound to go up even higher over the next year or so. ](https://preview.redd.it/ixjplttz1ue61.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72082cc45467ccedf862d620647c198872dc1aee)

**Q5 -   What percentage of your net worth is invested in Cryptocurrency?**  

&amp;#x200B;

[Interesting to see a more even spread across the board than I originally thought, however I was surprised to see that 12&amp;#37; of users surveyed had 90&amp;#37;+ NW invested in crypto. Best of luck to you all, I hope you all reap the rewards of that commitment! ](https://preview.redd.it/s4hcwyqq3ue61.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0821b5f46949fe43304e10f593efa72ea81467b)

**Q6 -  What age bracket are you in?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[If this sample size is reflective of the community as a whole, I'm genuinely shocked that so many users are in the 30-40 bracket. I've always felt that this sub \(and space in general\) is heavily dominated by 20-30 year olds, however its great to see a much more varied user group. Also shout out to the one 60+ year old surveyed! ](https://preview.redd.it/di0cx7um4ue61.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e91c3e7523f065f9d681f2d93a64b414174a79)

&amp;#x200B;

 **Q7 - How did you first hear about CryptoCurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Looks like over 30&amp;#37; of people surveyed heard about crypto through a friend. This makes sense to me as after mentioning crypto once or twice personally, my friends have often come forward to ask me questions and learn a bit about what Cryptocurrency actually is.](https://preview.redd.it/fr482qie5ue61.png?width=1036&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739d2d2a3ea3d236130fbaecd11f87ad69304c91)

**Q8 -  Have you ever recommended Crypto to a friend or family member?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I think this one speaks for itself! Looks like the majority of us love to tell out friends and family about Crypto! ](https://preview.redd.it/29joj02z5ue61.png?width=729&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eefb24f5b30dcebf2a142f49fc1bb9bfe87b6c05)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q9 -  Where do you see the global Crypto market cap in 5 years?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[This question was to gauge sentiment on the market as a whole, looks like the results show that we are all overwhelmingly bullish on cryptocurrency, with not a single person surveyed thinking that crypto will fall to 0! ](https://preview.redd.it/zg0wtjvl6ue61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0700d79b6a113d20c31f3fce4ab289f69a17f4ac)

**Q10 -  Do you believe regulation is good for cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was quite interested to see that so many people surveyed didn't have an opinion on regulation for cryptocurrency. Regulation has seemed to become an increasingly debated topic around here, so its interesting to see so many people yet to have an opinion! ](https://preview.redd.it/kptg23dz6ue61.png?width=626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80367ffdad5479aab2a9822f7672d162418edcfa)

**Q11 -  What do you hold more of, BTC or Alts?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Again, this one interested me! When people in the sub ask where to start, I often see a big chunk of people suggesting allocating the largest percentage of your portfolio to BTC. So its really interesting to see such a large proportion of people surveyed have a portfolio that is more heavily weighted with alts.](https://preview.redd.it/xgshaabm7ue61.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d36720deac402f9349cfa70b6ef30b1cd82e117)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q12 -  What price do you think BTC could reach in the next 12 months?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Another market sentiment question, however I do admit I completely forgot to add a sub 50k option, so I unintentionally skewed this whole set of results in a bullish light. Sorry!!](https://preview.redd.it/qp2b1a5a8ue61.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f52ac8a8cbeaa8cb08e20ccd328a7b45aeac8c6)

**Q13 -  Have you ever participated in an airdrop?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Not too much to say on this one! Great to see so many getting involved in airdrops! ](https://preview.redd.it/5k9jz29l8ue61.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc4290803380bfcb68728942a48cd997b43f872)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q14 -  What would you feel more comfortable investing in? Cryptocurrency or stocks?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Not surprised at all by this one, As this survey was conducted in a cryptocurrency sub, I was expecting this to be weighted much more heavily to crypto, I'm sure the reverse would be the result in a personal finance sub!](https://preview.redd.it/sugsgdpx8ue61.png?width=649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fcb65ba50a1879b8cb9fa70a9658c53dc4636f4)

**Q15 -  Do you think BTC will still have the highest market cap in 5 years?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was really curious about this one and to see how many people thought that BTC might be dethroned as number 1. To be honest I was actually expecting many more people to think that an Alt may be number 1 in a few years, especially as so many here have more skin in alts than BTC! ](https://preview.redd.it/8y9xkipf9ue61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c9a2be33d8c90ef534c67fac1ac9c0b3b0384aa)

**Q16 -  Do you trade cryptocurrency?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I was really interested to see how many people surveyed actually trade, even if its just rarely! I've always been under the impression this sub is weighted much more heavily towards a buy and hold \(HODL\) strategy. ](https://preview.redd.it/wjuc2rw2aue61.png?width=533&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272182739d6be085f475046da0d204bb7916911e)

&amp;#x200B;

**Q17-  Do you hold any DeFi related projects?** 

&amp;#x200B;

[I'm not surprised to see that so many here hold DeFi projects, with the big DeFi boom over the last year or so its unsurprising that many of us want a piece of the action! ](https://preview.redd.it/si5mif7jaue61.png?width=504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db8cd9dc8133ae4adde0677339e630973ac4d738)

&amp;#x200B;

**The End!**

I hope that this was informative, I really enjoyed putting this together and I just want to thank everyone who participated! It would be great to get some feedback and question ideas below as I think running another one of these with new questions and a larger sample size would be really interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

2. People have been saying for over a month we need to retrace atleast 20% to find some stability.  Well this is it and a large dip like this right now is necessary for the bull market to continue.

* Stop looking at your portfolio. Looking at it wont change anything.
* Go around the park and walk. Relax yourself. Your health is more important!
* Do not panic sell. A loss is not a loss unless you sell it. Your profit is also not a profit unless you sell. Either way FOMO and panic selling are both bad. Turn off that pc or mobile and relax.
*  Never think about ending your life. Money can be gained while your life is priceless.

Some are really heavy hodl bags not going anywhere, some are whole coins, some were scams, and some are completely dead with devs no where to be found or possibly dead themselves.

I wouldn't be surprised. 

The rest are fractions, and dust on a wide range of exchanges, and wallets.

Since late 2016, everytime I did a transfer from a wallet or exchange, I unintentionally left dust behind.  By early 2018 I realized I accumulated over 100 types of dust on cold wallets including but not limited to...  actual dust that I had to wipe off one of my flash drives.   Since then till now, I logged into every single one of my accounts (over 80 exchanges), and decided it was a good idea to collect as many shitcoins as I possible can starting with  my favorite shitcoin site of all time...Craptopia.  

Cryptopia was easily the best worst shitcoin exchange of all time.  That's where I got cryptos most people never heard of , like lottocoin. I own over 100 LottoCoin because you know... It gave me the sense of owning a piece of the lottery.   Don't know which lottery it reminds me of.   For all I know it could be lottery in the Republic of Sierra Leone for the grand prize of a basket of fruit with a malaria mosquito hidden inside.   I actually made a 200% ROI off it from a swing trade.

Anyone ever heard of Tablecoin?  Someone shilled my boss into.       He called me up one day back during the bull rush of Dec 2017 , and told me someone walked into his shop to shill him this amazing new coin that was used to tip waiters at restaurants.    Told him it was gonna be huge.    He actually bought some!  Then asked me if the coin was good or not.  I wanted to slap the SHIT out of him.     He was that type of person. Always getting shilled into all types of shit in his life.  You know, the type of person that orders off infomercials at 2am?  That's him.   He gave me some.  I still have it.    I don't know why I even accepted it.   

So back to what I was saying. I made a real conscious effort to accumulate as many shit coins as I possibly can and now I have over 1,000 crypto currencies.  

When I get the time one day, I'm going to make a list of everything I own, and what exchange so everyone can see how much effort it actually takes to get on some of these exchanges to buy scam shit.  

Don't know how long it's going to take but I'm aiming to own over 10,000 cryptos.  I aiming to be the all time shitcoin leader.  Maybe one day I will inspire a fleet of shitcoin enthusiasts from around the world, maybe kids will look up to me.   Maybe I'll be in magazines.  Or maybe on a poster attached to a dart board.   

Doesn't matter. At least I'll die knowing I made it to the top in something.


EDIT:  without including a few of my holds, I estimate the total value to be about $300 worth, and about 60-70% of them are dust, many whole coins are worth  anywhere between less than penny to $0.25.",CryptoCurrency,"Life of a SHiTCOiN Enthusiast: I now own OVER 1,000 Crypto!"
1614107437,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqqc1q/20_dip_looks_pretty_normal_to_me/,1508,10259,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing.

The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now.

I went to bed pissed off and I’ve woken up even more pissed off. I dabble a bit in cryptos and eToro completely shut me out of buying the dip and now I wake to every crypto I hold back up by at least double figures. 

It’s now time for us to stop complaining and actually do something about eToro’s corruption and manipulation of us. 

So I spent 5 hours before I went to bed writing emails of complaint. I’m in the U.K. and have raised official complaints to the U.K. SEC, the department of trade, the financial ombudsman, my local MP, the minister for finance, the trade secretary, the SIA and GSI, the financial audit authority, the home office, the US trade envoy to the U.K., the US Embassy in London, The Ambassador, and about 10 other high level individuals who are involved in stock and shares and trading platforms. I also copied in Yoni the CEO of eToro so he can see how unhappy I am. With permission I also copied in my 3 friends who happened to be lawyers. 

I also emailed to the USA as well but I’m not as informed on your processes. So I email the US SEC, the U.K. Ambassador to Washington DC, the FTC and various high ranking members, the fraud department within the FBI, and small business department within the FBI, the anti trust department Commissioner, the financial ombudsman and the Chairman of internet financial services. A few others too who I don’t remember off the top of my head. 

I am taking this serious. I collected about 250 pieces of evidence on eToro trading manipulation. My lawyers will file in the most appropriate way and I will go to court. 

I have an idea we could do a class action lawsuit but then actions speak louder than words. By that I mean people like to complain but do nothing about it. They can’t even be bother to change platforms. 

If you feel we should do a class action lawsuit you have to be committed and have proof how eToro manipulated your trading. So over the next two to four weeks I’ll be seeing where we stand. 

If you wish to join me, whether in the U.K. or USA to start with please just email your name and address so my lawyers can register interest as to whether we do have the chance of doing a large group class action. 

Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts. 

Best wishes,

Martin",CryptoCurrency,Fed up of eToro’s manipulation of us.

1614892739,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lxvpkp/bat_and_brave_browser/,213,195,"Yuval Noah Harari had a great part in one of his books which talked about the story of the indigenous people who sold Manhattan to colonizers for trinkets and beads because they didn't understand how someone could own land, or the value that owning it has. He compared that situation to the modern day, where most of us freely give our data to google and facebook, without comprehending its true value.

  I feel like Data ownership is going to be majorly important in the near future, which is one of the main reasons I'm so interested in BAT/Brave. Rather than functioning as a store of value or strictly as a currency, Brave and BAT are attempting to change the way we interact with targeted advertising and data ownership online.

I wanted to  make this post to spread some info about BAT/Brave I recently learned, as well as see what other people think and know about it, as I'm relatively new to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is it?** 

Brave is an internet browser which uses BAT (Basic Attention Token) as a token. You can award BAT to content creators who make stuff you enjoy, and earn BAT either as a content creator or by watching advertisements. Brave browser has a built in BAT wallet where your earned BAT accumulate. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**

\- Built in Ad Blocker

\- Built in torrent downloader

\- Built in BAT Wallet

\- Built in TOR private browsing

\- Claims to be Faster than Chrome

\- Claims to use less memory than Chrome

\- Claims to use less battery than Chrome

\- Doesn't sell your data

\- Pays you for advertisements you watch

\- Can directly tip other Redditors if browsing reddit on Brave browser.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons**

\- In my experience it is slower than Chrome

\- Adoption. There is a lack of viewable ads for payment (depending on your location)

\- Adoption. Many content creators are not using Brave so tipping isn't always possible

\- Currently, even on Brave browser you still end up using chrome, yahoo, or another search engine.

\- Wallet is run through Uphold and requires verification to withdraw BAT to another wallet or exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

**Examining the Pros and Cons**

First off the built in Adblocker works quite well. I really only seem to see ads that are through the paid BAT function. 

The built in torrent downloader is one of my favorite features so far and was a pleasant surprise. If you use a torrent site like the popular pirate themed one, Brave will download the files directly in your browser instead of opening up a program like qbit or utorrent. Then when completed you can open the file and watch it (if its a show or movie) in your browser window, or download it. 

The BAT wallet seems fine. Its nothing fancy. Just stores your accumulated BAT. You can't transfer it out of your wallet unless you have more than 25 BAT. The main possible issue here is that the wallet is run through Uphold. Idk much about them so it could be inconvenient or sketchy?  I'm nowhere near 25 BAT so maybe someone with more experience can shed light on the wallet and how transferring BAT works. 

The option to open private browsing windows in TOR is pretty cool. I have never used it in the past, and really don't know much about it, but having another added layer of privacy doesn't hurt. 

Brave claims to be faster than Chrome. This might be true for some people, but in my experience it is a bit slower.  They also claim to use less battery and memory. The only verification of this I've seen appears in new tabs of the brave browser. 

The primary benefit of Brave is that it doesn't sell your data to anyone who offers to buy it. It creeps me out when I search for something and then get ads about it for the rest of the week. Brave works to reduce that type of shit. Basically, preventing a ton of ads, and paying you for the ones you do get. 

Being able to tip other Redditors directly is the feature I'm most interested in. Moons have been really cool for this Sub so far IMO and it sorta bums me out that I can't easily tip crypto in other subs. Being able to tip BAT easily through reddit is a nice feature. If enough people adopt Brave it would be something I could see myself using pretty often. As of now, there don't seem to be a ton of people who can receive Brave tips on reddit.  I create cocktails and post photos on reddit and Instagram so I'd definitely like to receive BAT tips and send them to other bartenders for cool drinks/recipes.  I think BAT tips are working on YouTube as well but I'd like to see them expanded to Instagram. 

The Cons I listed earlier are pretty self explanatory. The biggest ones are rooted in lack of adoption so far. Another big issue is that as of now there is no Brave search engine. They do have plans to launch their own soon though, which solves that problem.

I've seen some people say they don't like the Uphold wallet or verification. As I haven't verified I cant really say for sure how it is, but having options in terms of storage would be nice.

The speed thing is pretty annoying though. Supposedly its faster than Chrome, but that's not the case in me experience. 

Last, Brave is set to auto-contribute your BAT each month based on the sites you visit. You can simply turn off this feature if you don't want to give away all your BAT. However, you really don't earn much BAT through watching ads. You won't become rich by simply clicking through advertisements. 

&amp;#x200B;

***TLDR:*** BAT and Brave are a cool project working to give users more control of their internet browsing data, and pay them for advertisements. There are some solid pros and a few cons so far.  I'm hoping this post will spur more discussion and users who have experience with these pros and cons, or knowledge of pros and cons not listed here can bring that information into the light.",CryptoCurrency,BAT and Brave Browser

**Intro:**

With the latest boom in interest in the crypto markets, I thought it would be good for all of the newcomers to pull together a ton of information and highlight some partnership info with what is, in my opinion, one of the best crypto projects in the sphere. This series will highlight a number of HUGE partnerships and working relationships which are already confirmed with VeChain, the companies involved in the partnership, and the technology and solutions being worked on with those partners. **For the first leg of the series, I covered five of the most recognizable names partnered with VeChain: Walmart China, DNV GL, PwC, BMW, and BYD**. Links to the full writeups in the headings below. Thanks and DYOR!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** [**Walmart China**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/loc1do/vechain_partnership_highlight_series_walmart_china/)

***Foodsafe Tracability System***

&gt;Walmart China is using VeChain technology to track the supply chain of the goods they sell in stores in China, including meat and produce, at limited scale for now. These products have a QR code or NFC chip embedded in the packaging which can be scanned from your phone, to reveal the details of how that product made it to the shelves of the store prior to purchase. This could include how the animal was raised, the fertilizer contents which the produce was grown in, the farm which raised the goods, the path of delivery from farm to store, etc. These are just some of the details of this alpha stage of their adoption of VeChain tech into their supply chain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Assuming things go well with the launch in China, Walmart could move to implement Vechain technology in their global supply chain. Once VeChain has a large scale live partnership with Walmart US, we should expect things to really start to look up from there. Other companies will see the Fortune 1 company partnered with VeChain and see all of the benefits their technology brings, and will flock to use it as well or be left in the dust as the industry evolves. Since the partnership with Walmart China began, they have already moved forward with bringing their Sams Club stores into the mix as well with their Safe Food Tracability Platform.

***VerifyCar***

&gt;Odometer fraud is a big problem in the automotive industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cihan explains that **in Germany, one-third of all vehicles sold have a manipulated odometer**. The value of a car depends on the number of kilometers driven, resulting in an economic impact of this fraud of around $3.400 per car.  
&gt;  
&gt;Blockchain-based solutions like **VerifyCar** offer a cure for this problem. This app, currently being piloted, could enable users to track and verify the complete vehicle history, and share data – like the mileage – with third parties. It could even be used in conversation with the seller: “As a potential buyer, I could use the **VerifyCar app** on my phone to scan the QR code in the seller’s app,” Dr. Luckow explains. “A green check mark then tells me that the used vehicle’s data is plausible and has been verified.”

&gt;In the initial release of a series of proof of concepts established between the three partnering parties, BYD announces that they have completed a carbon banking solution for the car models. This solution utilizes VeChain’s automobile lifecycle management solution that encompasses nearly every branch of the automotive industry. This will be the first enterprise level application moving the data of millions of cars, buses, trains, and other vehicles onto a public blockchain platform.  
&gt;  
&gt;This carbon bank solution rewards vehicle operators with carbon credits based on their vehicles’ driving performance and carbon reduction. This solution provides the tools necessary to construct a blockchain-based ecosystem aimed at reducing the global carbon footprint. Each footprint captured will be recorded on the VeChainThor Blockchain and made available to clients interested in participating in the initiative. With this solution, corporations will be able to access a platform that facilitates easy data management, sharing, and analytics. Data will no longer be considered fragmented and untrustworthy, but united and reliable.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Double comment karma vs post karma**
* **20% bonus for keeing moons from previous distribution in vault**
   * Users that have not moved MOONs out of their vault from the previous month would receive a 20% bonus to their total karma for the purposes of calculating MOON distribution, with that scaling down to 0% bonus linearly for the case of people that have moved all MOONs out of their vault from the previous month's distribution. This would not affect users receiving MOONs for the first time.
   * With the possible exception of using MOONs to buy special memberships - that purchase would not count towards your bonus.
* **Limit post/comment karma to 1k**
   * This poll will limit the karma anyone can receive from posts and comments to 1k per post or comment.
* **Change moon distribution for comedy posts and media posts.**
   * Comedy posts and media posts MUST be posted with the appropriate flair.
   * Screenshots of tweets or from other social media must be posted with the ""media"" flair if non-comedy or comedy if comedy.
   * Karma weight for posts with the flairs “media” and “comedy” will be reduced to 10% with a cap of 500 moons.
   * Restrict the ability to edit post flairs to only mods. This is to prevent switcheroos.
* Edit: **~~Proposal to give 0 karma for MOON distribution to copy and paste meme posts~~**
   * This one is rejected because its to hard to implement. There is also a poll about banning memes al together so. 

At the moment of the snapshot, everything is included. So when you get the 20% bonus, that will mean its added to your karma. The same applies for the double comment karma, this is added to your karma.

If i missed something, please comment.

I'll preface this post by saying that you should **ALWAYS** be including your crypto trading information come tax season, though ultimately it's your neck that's on the line if you choose not to. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first thing's first, how can I get screwed over by trading in a bull market?

In places like the US and Canada, you're supposed to be disclosing any and all trade information when you sell X crypto, to buy X crypto. In Canada anyways, you're taxed on 50% of your capital gains. In the US, you're taxed anywhere from 10% to 40% of your capital gains if hodling for under a year... **Why is this important?**

Let me give you a scenario...

&amp;#x200B;

Say that you were lucky enough to buy 2 BTC at $10,000 each around October of 2020, and held onto it into 2021. If hypothetically in July we see BTC rally and surpass $100,000 and you decide that you want to trade your 2 BTC for ETH. Given US tax law, you now owe 32% of the capital gains you made on that trade. 32% of $180,000 would be about **$57,600 owed** after subtracting your initial $20,000 capital investment. **No big deal, right?** 

Now say (heaven forbid) that BTC and ETH crash off the face of the earth back down to the $10,000 and $400 range respectively by December..... **Well tough shit if your portfolio is nearly diminished, you still owe $57,600 on that trade from 2021.**

&amp;#x200B;

This **HAS** happened, guys... /r/CC was flooded with posts similar to these back in 2018-2019 because people went in assuming that the bull market would never end, and ended up screwing themselves over by being careless...

If you're serious about putting a large sum of money into crypto, use your head. Don't go trading willy-nilly when the market is up. Believe me, it's not worth the future headache...

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** ***You hypothetically buy 2 BTC at $10,000 each in October of 2020. Price of BTC goes to $100,000 in July and you decide to trade it all for ETH. The market tanks, and BTC/ETH is back down to $10,000/$400 respectively by December. In the US you now owe $57,600 on the capital gains made on that trade in July regardless of how fucked your portfolio is.... Don't screw yourself over by trading carelessly when the market is up....***",CryptoCurrency,Caution to those trading crypto at the height of a bull-market.....

In fact, I’m glad I see red candles. Now’s a great time to build your stacks. Remember: time in the market beats timing the market. So have patience, the market needs to stabilize a little before going up again. Did you get into crypto expecting an unlimited money printer that goes BRRR?


If you just recently jumped into crypto, I can certainly understand why this dip would make you uneasy. It must feel like you lit your money on fire if your entire portfolio is red and you have no gains to show for it. You’ll know the market is truly in a bad place once the Suicide Hotline number is pinned to the front page. That’s the biggest buy signal you’ll see on this subreddit.


My take? This is just a pit stop before we see higher highs later this year. Don’t be surprised if we stabilize and go flat for a while. But of course, this is not financial advice and everything could come crashing down. Don’t take my word for it. I’m just some dude on Reddit.

But I see a lot of posts, particularly at the moment, where people that are clearly unhappy with their lives are pinning their escape entirely on crypto.

There's nothing wrong with dreaming of a better life and financial independence, but equally it's important not to put all your eggs in one basket. Don't fall into the trap of viewing crypto as a sure thing and stop developing other aspects of your life, whether that's looking for a better job, training or education.

Bull markets don't last forever, and even if crypto does truly take you to the moon, it's likely to hit a few asteroids along the way. It will be much easier to emotionally deal with the ups and downs if you have your fingers in various pots, and other options to achieve financial success.

So when you think about diversifying your investments, that doesn't simply mean buying some shitcoins to go with your BTC and ETH, or FOMOing into GME or the latest hot stock - it's about investing in yourself too.

This is a problem with decentralization that we as a community need to step up to the plate and address.

I’m not quite sure how to flair this but I think this is an important conversation to have and I don’t see anyone having it.

The more I dig into Uniswap the more fake erc20 tokens I’m finding... im not going to list them all here but I’ve accounted over $50,000,000 in liquidity for FAKE tokens. For the sake of this discussion let’s focus on just one, DOGE-ETH. Go ahead and check the pair on Uni and take a look at the “DOGE” ETH contract. For those unaware, DOGE runs on its own chain and it isn’t a erc20 token. My only explanation is that someone created an ETH token, called it DOGE and deployed it to Uniswap?

I’m an experienced trader, I’ve used Ethereum for many years and even I caught myself one click away from buying a substantial amount of a fake token I thought was legitimate (Polymath).

What’s bizarre is these fake tokens exist period.  They follow the prices of the actual assets and I’ve yet to see a rug pull on one of them. To me this feels extremely unhealthy and makes me uneasy about Uniswap in general. It’s like a house of cards ready to collapse and I’d hate to see the market devastated by the longer term repercussions on these fake tokens.

What’s even worse is that I’ve been actively reporting these tokens I find in the official subs of these projects I’ve discovered to be fake. Nobody seems to care. I’ve sent lengthy and detailed reports to multiple crypto journalists and editors. Not a single response and not a single article warning users about this.

I’ve posted many times right here only to hear crickets. Literally, nobody seems to have any concern.

I don’t want to come off as a white knight here but I feel that people need to be aware of this phenomenon.

Am I completely alone here, does anybody think this needs more attention?

what happened:  


10 days ago I wanted to send some money to my broker in the US ($6500)

I have been sending swift payments for years, and as usual I entered information and sent. They said it should take 1 to 3 days (lol, why? but okay.). I also paid $35 fees for this slow process.

3 days later, someone from my bank called and said intermediatery bank couldn't find the bank account and they need me to send a handwritten signed document telling them where to send money. They said it is okay if I take a photo of the paper and send them.  


I wrote one and sent. They called back and said it is too long. I only need to write bank name and account. I wrote another one and sent.  


5 more days passed. I called the bank like 10 times and they answered only 1 time. They said they are looking into it but it can take up to 1 month as it takes time to manually review.  


10 days from initial Swift, they returned money. But, not only they kept original 35 dollars fees but also cut another 15 dollars. So total $50 in fees. They didn't do the work I paid them to do and kept my money for 10 days.   


So how are they supposed to be the future? In what world they can charge for something that they don't provide? How can they hold my money 10 days?

&amp;nbsp;

What a few days we have had off the back of the GME news. The world has been watching, and world is saying no, no to centralised control and market manipulation against the individual. There may have been Pump and Dumps, there will be pain. So welcome to all our newest members, we are happy to have you. 

&amp;nbsp;


So if you are new, I promise it may not feel like it, but you are early. Ethereum is the beginning - DEX's are exploding, lending platforms, yield farming, earning through gaming and derivatives trading, collectibles, insurance - you name it. It's here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ask yourself what has a bank given you? Now lets look at what crypto gives you... One example - I never received the UNI airdrop, but if you are new... they gave away 400 tokens just for attempting a transaction on their platform prior to September. It didn't even have to succeed. Those tokens today? worth $8000. And rising. 

&amp;nbsp;

Crypto rewards people for participating, for being here, being present and believing. Early bitcoin believers made it huge, they mined and earned. ETH believers saw it go from single digits to four.

&amp;nbsp;


Decentralised exchanges give you rewards for simply giving them a go, Your tokens allow you to vote on the future of the platforms. All the financial products available, you can understand how they work, and they work for you. To pay you. Not some bullshit sub-inflation level interest. It takes some time to learn, it can be bewildering, especially if you come from a place where you aren't used to seeing systems which actually work for you. 

&amp;nbsp;

We will go down again, markets will stagnate and dip. But remember you are here for it, now. You are early, and this is the future. So if you are new, do your research. Not only to avoid scams but to realise just what this is. What it means for the world. 


&amp;nbsp;

Our very own moons should show you that this is the future, community finance and rewards. You remember the participation award at school? Well congrats, we all won that. You don't even have to be good to succeed, you just have to be in the right place and participate. 


&amp;nbsp;

#**Money may have never liked you, banks turned their back on you. But crypto, crypto loves you.**#

Keep that mindset, of abundance, and of change. And I will see you in all in ten years time when these magical digital currency beans have carried us all to the moon.

With Stepn mooning recently, I thought we could highlight other good projects built on Solana. 

Here are some that I've been following over the past few months:

1. Sator

One reason Stepn is such a great project is because it rewards people for doing something they already do anyways - walking. For Sator, people are rewarded by answering trivia questions about popular TV shows and movies. They've been expanding a lot recently as well, which I think is a good sign.

2. Raydium

I’ve been using Raydium for a little while now and it probably needs less of an introduction. Regardless, Raydium is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that is incorporated with Serum, a DEX also on Solana (more on that later), meaning it offers some advantages of a DEX as well. There’s also an option to earn RAY (their native token) for providing liquidity, which has previously yielded good results for me. Overall, it’s definitely innovative but still not everyone is too into DeFi yet.

3. Serum Dex

Also popular, Serum is a DEX that brings high speed and low transaction costs to DeFi. It’s permissionless, which is a big factor in what makes Raydium good as well. Serum Foundations was created by big names like FTX, Alameda Research, and others. Again nothing fancy but gotta give credit where it’s due.

4. CryptoPlease

This one is definitely worthy of mentioning since it follows the theme of crypto projects that can be used for everyday life. Crypto Please allows crypto payments in the easiest way possible, making the technical aspect of the blockchain and other things pretty much invisible. It currently supports all SPL tokens. I’ve never actually used it because I don’t spend crypto, but it can be a good alternative to sending crypto to friends and whatnot.

And yes, it absolutely would be! And that alone should be enough to tell you that it can't be this easy. The thing is: because of how that whole network works, a lot of TITAN was printed when it crashed.

10 days ago, the circulating supply was 116 million. Now it's 34 **trillion**, or 34,000 billion, or 34,000,000 million. Yeah, that's a lot. So let's consider the market cap, which is:

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

A coin price of 1 cent would mean a market cap of 344 billion, putting it on the #2 spot, higher than ETH. At 2 cents it would get close to BTC, at 5 cents its market cap would be higher than all other crypto combined.

If you are active in crypto-related subreddits you'll soon notice a (understandable) misconception:

New users tend to think that their coins are stored in their wallet. Therefore, they ask questions like: ""what happens to my coins if I delete my wallet? How can I move my voins to my new PC etc.

I find it necessary to stress the follwing fact:

**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**

**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**

**Your wallet does not hold any coins. Your coins are not stored in your wallet**

&amp;#x200B;

# But where are my coins?

Coins are ""stored"" in the blockchain. The blockchain is a really long list of every transaction between (coin) adresses. Since all transactions are known, and adresses are public, the amount of coins at a given adress is known, too.

Think of a coin adress as a letterbox made of (indestructable) glass: everybody can see how much is inside, everybody can stuff coins into it, but **only the person(s) with the private key can take something out.**

# But what does a wallet do?

The most important feature of a wallet is to (securely) hold the (private) keys to the corresponding adresses on the blockchain. Therefore it allows you to access (sent/spent) your coins. **Think of it like a big keychain.**

To generate keys and adresses your wallet uses a **seed phrase of 12 (or 24) english words**. Entering the same seed phrase always generates the same keys/adresses. Setting up a new wallet starts with a random seed phrase.

# Questions?

* How do I move my coins between devices/different wallet software? -&gt; *You just enter your current seed phrase into the new software/ the same software on another device.*
* So do I lose my coins if I delete my wallet? -&gt; *No, since they are still in the blockchain. Without a wallet you are not able to do anything with your coins, though*
* This means I can have the same wallet on different devices (i.e. pc/tablet/phone)? -&gt; *Yes. Be aware, that you have to keep all those devices secure.*
* So if lose my seed phrase, my coins are gone? -&gt; *Your wallet will show you your seed phrase, so you are good as long as it is still installed. If you neither have your wallet or your seed phrase - then yes, nobody can access them anymore.*
* Does that mean that anybody who knows my seed phrase can move my coins? -&gt; *Yes!!*

# TLDR? [edit]

* coins are stored at adresses on the blockchain,  not in a wallet
* a wallet gives you access to your blockchain adresses
* the whole access thing is ""compressed"" in a 12 (or 24) words seed phrase

Therefore: 

* protect your seed phrase!
* don't lose your seed phrase!!
* everybody who asks for your seed phrase is a scammer!!!",CryptoCurrency,A wallet doesn't hold any coins!

Unlike the stock market, crypto has a very different valuation. A share in stock is generally based on the worth of the entire company, profits, and performance. 
Crypto is more based on projected value and sentiment (there are exceptions to this with tokens such as BNB or stable/backed coins). 
The upside to this is there is no real set limit to how high or fast a cryptocurrency can grow if there is enough demand for it. The obvious downside is that it can fall just as fast.
So does that mean that it's just too risky for someone new to join in? Well no, however, it's up to you to reduce the risks. 

#Risk management methods
#####Hold (aka hodl)
The most simple and often the most profitable. By holding for an extended period of time you can even out the ups and downs. Sometimes we are our worst enemy when it comes to trading, panic selling when the price starts to go down, or even selling everything when there is an increase just for another larger gain a few days later. 
For Bitcoin, if you had bought at any stage and held for over 5 years you would be in huge profit.  

Unfortunately holding isn't a magic bullet that will always lead to profit. There are times when holding doesn't work, there are many coins that have just faded away. Additionally, you may have to be prepared to lock up that crypto for 5 or 10 years which could have been earning money on other assets

#####DCA
Dollar-cost averaging, this one is pretty simple also. By putting in small amounts every week, month or year you can greatly reduce the volatility and additionally benefit from the dips. This can be superior to holding when there is a lot of price movement both up and down. Now is probably a good time to DCA rather than put a lump sum into crypto, hitting all-time highs can be a very risky time for the market to crash. 

One thing you may need to be careful of when doing the DCA strategy is not to get too sentimental on a coin that you like if it continues to fail. Spending more money on a lost project that will never recover is just throwing money away. 

#####Take profit
Taking profit can be a great way to keep the gains that you have made. Many people rode the 2017 hype and kept holding everything only to see it crash down to levels that still aren't even close to the all-time highs that they had. A good way to take profit is to set a % that you will sell. So if something gains 10% sell 2%, gains 50% sell 10%, and so on. After a while, you may sell off your initial investment and the rest will be ""free"" money without ever having the fear of making a loss. 

Taking profit will mean you gain less in the long run if a coin continues to climb without having major corrections so there is a trade-off with how much profit you want to take off your initial investment. 

#####Rebalance
Something that is done in stock market investing is to have a mixed portfolio of safe assets and risky assets to balance out your risk levels. You can do the same with crypto, unfortunately most of the market will follow each other so diversifying multiple crypto tokens isn't really going to work. One thing you can use is stable coins to dilute your crypto portfolio then rebalance when there has been a large shift in the market. This works the same as taking profit however it can be beneficial in both directions. When there is a dip in the price you can use the safe assets to buy more, then when it goes up you sell more to go back into the safe proportion.

#####Combination
Aside from using a single risk management method, you can combine the above to suit your own needs.

Think of it as a promotion where you get paid to often learn about or join a community.

I've put a few low effort ones down here that I've personally used and can vouch for.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinbase:**

Most of you have probably heard of this one, Coinbase has a series of airdrops where you can watch a video and answer a few questions to get a few dollars worth of crypto everytime. The ones that are active at the time of writing are:

&amp;#x200B;

* $3 - NuCypher (NU)
* $3 - TheGraph (GRT)
* $6 - Celo (CGLD)
* $19 - Compound (COMP)
* $10 - Stellar Lumens (XLM)

That's **$41** dollars in crypto for free. All you have to do is sign up for an account, complete KYC verification and join the wait list and wait for your invite to complete these. NO DEPOSIT NEEDED.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinmarketcap earn:**

This one is very similar to coinbase, but you'll also need a Binance account. Create both a Coinmarketcap account and a Binance account. Make sure to complete KYC verification on your Binance account. Next go to [https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/) and complete the quizzes to earn crypto. There's no waitlist here, just know that tokens are distributed at the end of the period (March 1st).

You'll need a Binance account since the crypto will be airdropped into your Binance wallet. If you need help with the quizzes, the answers are readily available on Google. Some have extra requirements though, but it is all explained on their respective pages. Current airdrops are:

&amp;#x200B;

* $10 - Nervos Network (CKB)
* $10 - 1inch (1INCH)
* $10 - TheGraph (GRT)
* $10 - The Sandbox (SAND)

This **$40** is an estimate based on what I've earned in the past and what's available in information right now. End result may vary (but not by alot). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Airdropbob:**

Airdropbob is a website that puts together a list of all the different kind of airdrops. Some are low effort, some are not. I highly suggest you check them out at [https://www.airdropbob.com/](https://www.airdropbob.com/) and see what they offer for yourselves!

1614272426,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lsb7jf/crypto_lingo_guide/,115,125,"Having joined this community pretty recently, I found myself constantly looking up new terms as they appeared in discussions. Here's a list of commonly used phrases and acronyms that might be helpful for newcomers like me.

# Describing Currencies:

* **Altcoin:** Abbreviation for ""Alternate Coin"". Technically, an altcoin is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Some people may not include Ethereum in this definition.
* **ATH:** Initialism for ""All Time High"". The highest price a given cryptocurrency has ever reached.
* **DeFi:** Abbreviation for ""Decentralized Finance"". DeFi coins are cryptocurrencies that are developed with the goal of eliminating or greatly reducing reliance on centralized banks or other financial institutions. Many cryptocurrencies fall under this category, as decentralized finance is one of the tenets of cryptocurrency.
* **Fiat:** Government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold. The Fiat currency in the United States is the US dollar (USD). Thanks u/TurbulentMoon!
* **Gas Fee:** A fee associated with Ethereum, in which users pay miners for the computing power used to process their transaction. Thanks u/antiskylar1!
* **PnD:** Initialism for ""Pump and Dump"". Pump and Dump coins are cryptocurrencies that are the target of a pump and dump scheme. These coins are bought up (pumped) by a party, then shilled to newcomers, who drive up the price by buying more. Once the price has spiked from the new traffic, the pumpers dump their coins, selling for huge profits and leaving the newcomers with the worthless coins.
* **PoS:** Initialism for ""Proof of Stake"". Cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Stake validate transactions based on the number of coins held by the user. This is a newer form of validation than Proof of Work that is more energy efficient and potentially less vulnerable to 51% attacks. Cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Stake aren't mined, but validators receive payment for their service in the form of interest on their staked coins.
* **PoW:** Initialism for ""Proof of Work"". Cryptocurrencies that use Proof of Work validate transactions based on the amount of ""work"", or computational effort, devoted to validating the transactions. This is the method of validation used by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies using Proof of Work are mined, and miners receive payment for their service from mining the next block in the chain and receiving the fees associated with it.
* **Shitcoin:** A worthless cryptocurrency, or one with no future. Whether a coin is a shitcoin depends on who you ask. This term tends to refer to altcoins that are the subject of Pump and Dump schemes.

# Describing Users:

* **Bag-holder:** Usually used to refer to people on the losing end of a pump and dump scheme. People who bought a coin near a peak and held onto it as the price fell.
* **Bot:** Abbreviation for ""Robot"". Accounts that are used to generate attention through automated posts or comments. These bots can be used to spread (mis)information about a specific coin in order to manipulate the price of said coin.
* **FUDster:** Someone who spreads Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt about crypto.
* **Maxi:** Abbreviation for ""Maximalist"". A(n) &lt;insert crypto here&gt; maxi is someone who believes that this specific cryptocurrency is the only valid cryptocurrency and that all others are inferior or doomed to fail.
* **Shill:** Someone who spams positive (mis)information about a specific coin in order to convince others to invest in it. This term is usually used to refer to users who seek to artificially inflate the price of a coin that they already hold.

# Describing Wallets:

* **Cold Wallet:** A wallet that does not connect to the internet. This can be a paper wallet, a hardware wallet, etc. This is often regarded as a safer type of wallet.
* **Exchange:** Some exchange websites allow buyers to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency into a wallet owned by the exchange. While this is okay for short term storage for trading, it is inadvisable to leave cryptocurrency in an exchange wallet if it can be avoided, due to the potential for hacks or exchange shutdowns. As they say, ""Not your keys, not your crypto"".
* **Hardware Wallet:** This is a physical device that stores various private keys for your wallets. This is often regarded as one of the safest wallets, as the private seed is never typed into an internet connected device. User error can still lead to losses. For example, losing your private seed phrase can make it impossible to retrieve the private keys on the device.
* **Hot Wallet:** A hot wallet is a software wallet that can connect to the internet. This type of wallet can potentially be less secure if the device running the software is infected with malware. Screen readers and keyloggers can allow malicious parties to obtain one's private seed phrase or keys.
* **Paper Wallet:** A paper wallet is a document (often printed) that includes a QR code and the keys associated with a wallet. These can be safer than hot wallets if kept safe, but it still requires the private keys to be saved to a device, which leaves the keys vulnerable on infected devices.

# Investing Strategies:

* **DCA:** Initialism for ""Dollar Cost Averaging"". This is an investing strategy in which a fixed amount of currency is put into crypto in fixed time intervals. This strategy is recommended, as it is easy and requires less skill than timing the market while still yielding good returns in the long run. The fixed cash price means that fewer coins are purchased when the price is high and more coins are purchased when the price is low.
* **DYOR:** Initialism for ""Do Your Own Research"". This advice is generally recommended for all investments. The phrase encourages buyers to investigate the goals and values of a cryptocurrency on their own instead of relying on the word of others who may have their own motives.
* **FOMO:** Acronym for ""Fear Of Missing Out"". This term is used when a buyer jumps on a crypto bandwagon following increased hype and prices. This strategy is inadvisable because it doesn't give adequate time for DYOR and can result in bag-holding if the coin was a pump and dump.
* **FUD:** Acronym for ""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt."" This market manipulation strategy involves spreading (mis)information in order to persuade investors to sell their crypto and drop the prices. Thanks u/nankin-stain and u/FiveUperdan!
* **HODL:** Meme'd misspelling of the word ""HOLD"". Originated from [this forum post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0). This advice encourages buyers to simply hold onto their crypto for the long term. This strategy relies on the fact that the cryptocurrency market has increased in value in the long term, despite occasional dips and crashes. The backronym, ""Hold On for Dear Life"" has been associated with this term.

I have been posting in the daily about this for the last few days, link to comments found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lskp84/daily_discussion_february_26_2021_gmt0/got2tqv/

&amp;nbsp;


This post covers some of the reasons I think we have dipped, why I believe we are still in a healthy range and have not even corrected as far as we did in january. Please see the disclaimer the bottom however, I am simply trying to share some potentially interesting information with the community. I have no clue what will happen. So please do what you think is best based on the circumstances you are in, and you see in the market. You will hopefully see if you go back through my comments, i have always tried to provide the disclaimer that I may well be wrong, and I would never want to suggest otherwise. 


&amp;nbsp;
___

&amp;nbsp;


The reason, I believe, we have corrected, when and how we have is due to a number of factors. Firstly, we were due a correction, with huge amounts of leverage, euphoria and extension upwards. So this point cannot be overemphasised, but I am more so going to highlight some of the potential catalysts and a few contributing factors to why i remain bullish even if we continue to dip towards the end of february. 

&amp;nbsp;

___

&amp;nbsp;


**F2pool affiliate miners - a potential catalyst**


&amp;nbsp;

However the main factor causing the february dump is, in my opinion the exact same thing which happened in january. This is f2pool affiliated miners dumping in a co-ordinated manner with huge amounts of short leverage through bitmex and bitfinex.


Most other pools and f2 historically have sold in steady flows. This is market manipulation to dump in this huge amount, with leverage. They did it in january and we had the exact same pattern now. There is no need to do it like this except you make billions in short positions.


Here is a link to the f2pool affiliate outflows to these exchanges: https://twitter.com/JustinBennettFX/status/1365037204800700421


and here is f2, themselves, essentially admitting to this (it isn't us, we don't control our miners, but essentially they still do it): https://f2pool.io/mining/insights/20210203-a-miner-difference-a-subtle-change-in-terminology/


Now we could argue - don't hate the player, hate the game. There business model and operational costs rely on them selling btc/eth - which is true and fair. However, to me, it appears quite clear this is a way to drive down price short term and massively profit. For comparison here is a link to overall miner outflows, f2pool outflows and a competitor - antmine outflows. From these links you can see this isn't all mining pools, this is purely coming from f2 (of course many pools sell of in portions for very valid reasons, but the trend is clear) (I also suggest zooming on the turn of the year for a better look:


Overall miner pool outflows: https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/180?window=day

f2pool miner outflows: https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/227?window=day

Antmine miner outflows: https://cryptoquant.com/overview/full/249?window=day


The important thing to remember here is, this is a short term play, miners ultimately want the price of btc to go up long term. I just see this as a way to make a huge amount of profit in the short term (even perhaps, one could speculate before they move back into long positions are futures expire toward the end of the month - i have no evidence for this however, just would be an obvious move to me). 


I have seem some even argue they are doing it for the good of the bull run - shorting hugely when the market is overheated to correct and allow us to cool off and refuel. Not sure I buy this one, personally, it is the kind of argument I expect someone to make when called out on their bullshit 'no no, we were doing it for you guys, honestly - we just made millions and liquidated all of you, but you'll thank us later'. Doesn't add up to me, but thought I may as well add it to give some semblance of balance. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Futures expiry and how this *may* impact the small dip we see:** 

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing to pay attention to is that typically as options contracts get close to expiry at the end of the month (CME), the price of many assets may often take a small dip, this is true for crypto at times as well. This chart here displays the current state for futures: https://twitter.com/Mtrl_Scientist/status/1365039342377455616/photo/1



For reference:

- OTM - out the money

- ITM - in the money

Additional reading on these concepts for calls (long) and puts (short) in futures/options trading:

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/what-difference-between-money-and-out-money.asp

&amp;nbsp;


And this is my comment from two days ago which accompanied that graph: 'CVD - is cumulative volume delta - so you have a large amount of volume of positions in the money underlying the price which are set to expire towards the end of the month.

As expiry approaches often you see people taking profits and the price will decline as these longs are closed. The faster you move, the better.

Therefore the heavy ITM calls are likely to take profit as we approach and the medium OTM puts are likely to hold to try and come into profit as price decreases (this is likely amplified by the dump and shorting by the f2 miners)

This is my basic understanding at least, based on what I think the chart is trying to show.

The strike price reference is where the Elon news came in, so expect a heavy amount of call options being closed at the 48k price range toward the end of the month,.

This of course doesn't mean we dip, plenty of new buyers can come in, lots of people may hold through expiry etc. But this is a visual to demonstrate this potential situation'

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**A brief bit of imperfect, shitty Technical analysis - a comparison to january**

&amp;nbsp;

Back in january, when i believe the same thing happened, we saw the price decline from 42,000 to our 20 day MA in the low 30s, we rebounded from here higher, before coming down to test the 50 day MA of 28-29k.


So far in february we came down to test the 20 day MA around 45k and rebounded from there, we have since come down and re-tested this level, should it break the 50 day MA is around 40-42k (it is rising every day obviously). Until then, we are yet to even repeat the janaury dump, never mind be in a bear market.


The point below this is somewhere between 30-35k, until we get below this range, the bull market trend is still below current prices. And I will not be concerned until that point - a point I do not expect us to reach

&amp;nbsp;

___


&amp;nbsp;

**What does this mean for me?** 


Frankly, I have no idea. I don't know if this short term dip is enough to crash bullish sentiment - I am a moron who knows nothing, like everyone else here. However, I believe, based on the things I have looked into, that I am right to remain extremely bullish even if we test lower.

&amp;nbsp;

I have outlined my strategy to deal with this here (from a few days ago) and so far I have followed it, with the only exception being I chose to sell FTM at a high point and was lucky i did so before the nodes issue (i may buy back in lower, depending on how it plays out) and i also skimmed a small amount of btc off at 51.5k as i wanted to put my money where my mouth was and test my ideas https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqxb15/daily_discussion_february_24_2021_gmt0/gol0fvi/ 

&amp;nbsp;

Overall I have set a number of laddered buys to try and capture this dip and will continue to buy in small increments should we rebound out of it over the coming days and weeks. 


I think either we rebound quickly over the coming weeks and forget all about this, or we may crab along this level before making our next move up. I have no reason to suggest either will happen or what various alts will do vs btc. Frankly I may be wrong, we may go to zero, however with all the uncertainty around why we dip, what causes it and where we may find support - I thought I would share my thoughts.


&amp;nbsp;

Volume continues to look low at this current level, at the time of posting, but there is a huge number of stablecoins on exchanges as a ratio vs btc and I suspect we may see a number of people waiting to see where the bottom is and how the next few days play out before jumping back in. I don't love those crypto twitter traders - but if you go check their accounts, most of them are mentioning this, and it seems like a reasonably valid expectation. Funding rates are down and I expect them to pick up at the start of march as f2 closes their positions (perhaps they even open long - would be a good way to make even more money), and other traders decide the bottom is in and buy back in.

___


&amp;nbsp;

*Disclaimer, this is simply my opinion, with a few potential causes, scenarios and ideas on how this plays out. It is the reason for my strategy and I believe everyone should have one. I am writing this out just to share information - I do not want to claim I am right or this is exactly what happens. The impact of a broader stock market decline over the last few days cannot be ruled out, however I do think this massive dumping of btc/eth is ultimately what made our correction so fast and sharp. This isn't to discount other factors, simply to add these factors onto the existing macro state


But I thought, based on the exact same pattern playing out in january it may help some people who are uncertain on whether to buy or sell, and whether this dip is out of the ordinary or something to panic over. Ultimately though, please do not take my advice, do what you think is best because I really do not have a clue and I can't emphasise that enough. This is a sharing of information, nothing more. We could go to zero tomorrow and I would be none the wiser.*

I tricked myself into thinking during the bear I was fine. Superficially I was all good, I barely checked my portfolio. I had basically emotionally written it off and agreed I would never sell. However I will admit it took a toll on me seeing huge amounts of money that could change my life disappear. 

I started investing much smaller amounts into crypto during the bear period and set myself a goal of selling portions of my portfolio as we entered a new bear market. This would be indicated by the price of BTC. I wanted to make sure I didn’t finish another cycle with nothing to show for it. I know some will HODL through multiple cycles but in terms of my own mental health and sanity, the comfort of seeing real profit outweighs just profit alone. 

I sold portions of my portfolio at BTC prices $40k, $47.5k and $55k and this not only covered everything I had ever invested in crypto. It also allowed me to build a 6 month emergency fund, complete a 20 per cent deposit for a 2 bed house, start a lump some investment into an index fund and give me a sense of financial security I had never had before. Most importantly, for the first time in years I feel no pressure about my crypto anymore. It’s like now I know I am in profit and what ever is left even if it went to 0 I have gained makes me so at ease. I have over 50 per cent of my portfolio left and I am fully comfortable to HODL.

You see people post advice and lessons ever day on here. I think the most important lesson I have learnt is to understand yourself. Understand your emotions and what works for you. Then you will have an indication of how to manage your investments. Life can be short and it really isn’t worth causing you stress over years. Peace and love to you all",CryptoCurrency,"I feel in a good place, for the first time in a long time."

This is what happens when a unscrupulous company needs more money fast and the chances of your Robinhood crypto positions being non-collateralized (non backed up) have literally never been higher. Even more so, the chances of Robinhood failing as a company have never been higher.

Look into the eyes of the young CEOs who made their money by deceiving retail investors and selling them to the hedge funds via order flow. Do you really want to let these guys hold your crypto?

For the next day I will personally answer any questions that any of you may have about selling your Robinhood positions and getting into a real exchange.

Time in the market is a huge factor, so if you're young and patient, chances are you'll make decent money even with less invested. 

Moreover, a smaller investment at first is ideal to test the waters, it gives you time to properly understand how crypto works, and do your own research on several projects.

I was also a broke college student when I put my first $200 in crypto in 2017. I wasn't really active in this sub because I felt like I was not part of this community.

About 3 weeks ago I got into the whole Gamestop stock thing and joined WSB. I saw all the posts saying that the price will go up again and that everybody was still holding and it was not too late to buy. So I FOMO'd and created an eToro account and put some money into it (only what I could afford to lose but it still hurt). In a matter of 1 week I saw my position in GME go down 80% but I also noticed an asset on the front page of eToro go from $0.30 to $0.40 and it kept going up rapidly. That asset was ADA, I checked it out and saw that it was a cryptocurrency, I started reading more and more about it and I really liked the idea behind it and I thought it has a huge potential to become the next ""big crypto"" like Bitcoin. That sent me down the rabbit hole of reading more about cryptocurrencies in general and joining this subreddit, where I learned a lot of valuable information on owning and trading crypto. I had to close my eToro account because I did not have the required documents to get verified, but I opened an account on a crypto exchange and I will not go back to stocks.

This NFT can be purchased with staking reward for another ERC-20 coin staking. Here’s the absolutely ridiculous journey.

I hold my ETH in Coinbase Wallet. To obtain a small cap stakeable token, I went to Uniswap, connected my wallet and swapped some ETH for XXX euros worth of tokens. Paid around 46 euros for the swap, fine.

Went to the staking center for that token, but it requires Metamask wallet for connection to the dApp. Cool, metamask ready, now to send some of these coins. Transaction fee from CB wallet to Metamask - 9 euros, no big deal.

I proceed to stake, but staking requires ETH for fees, specifically around 9 euros with of ETH from the same wallet (Metamask). Naturally, the MM wallet has no ETH, and I go to Deposit ETH from another wallet. And the fee to transfer around 9 euros worth of ETH from CB to MM wallet is... 600 to 900 fing EUROS. With 600 euro one taking around 2 hours to process. Not great at all.

Okay, I won’t stake, won’t use Metamask, let’s bring back the tokens to my CB Wallet. Transaction fee - 7 euros, but I need to add them to MM wallet first!

I go to Coinbase exchange app (not wallet), luckily converting one erc-20 token to ETH seemingly has mild fees or they are hidden, send this eth amount to MM, pay 6 euros of fees to then pay 7 euros again to finally transfer from MM to Coinbase Wallet.

I read good things about XLM, mainly its affordable transaction fees and its popularity in the liquidity market.

But that’s about it - I’m not entirely sure in terms of the financial side of things.
