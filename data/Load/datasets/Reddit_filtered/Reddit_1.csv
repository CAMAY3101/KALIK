1572250807,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/do5xwp/ethereum_on_arm_new_image_for_the_raspberry_pi_4/,81,210,"**TL;DR** Flash the MicroSD with the EthRaspbian Image. Plug an USB 3.0 SSD disk (blue port), connect an ethernet cable and power up the Raspberry Pi 4. You are now running a full Ethereum node.

&amp;#x200B;

**EthRaspbian** (ARM7) \[1\] is a custom Linux image for the **Raspberry Pi 4** \[2\] that runs **Geth** or **Parity** Ethereum clients as a boot service and automatically turns the device into a **full Ethereum node**. The image includes other components of the Ethereum ecosystem such as **Trinity, Status.im, Raiden, IPFS, Swarm and Vipnode** as well as initial support for **Eth2.0 clients**.

It also runs on the **Raspberry Pi 2/3** but due to hardware limitations these devices **are not capable of syncing the blockchain.** However, you can run **Geth** or **Parity** as **light clients** or **support the Ethereum network** by running other key software such as **Status.im, Raiden, IPFS or Swarm.**

For running a **full Ethereum node on ARM64 devices** (currently **NanoPC-T4** \[3\] and **Rockpro64** \[4\]), please see the **EthArmbian** project \[5\]

# Features

EthRaspbian Image takes care of everything, from setting up the environment to installing and running the Ethereum software as well as synchronizing the blockchain.

These are the main features:

* Based on Raspbian \[6\] **Debian Buster**
* Automatically **resizes the SD card**
* **Partitions and formats the USB SSD drive** (in case is detected) and **mount it as /home** for storing the Ethereum blockchain
* Creates an **Ethereum user account**
* **Changes the hostname** to something like ‚Äúethnode-e2a3e6fe‚Äù (HEX chunk based on MAC hash)
* Enables **SSH**
* Automatically reboots once for hostname change, new /home mount point and MicroSD resize to take effect
* **Runs Geth by default as a Systemd** service and starts syncing the Blockchain. Systemd monitors the Ethereum client binary and respawns it in case it gets killed or something unexpected happens (such as a reboot)
* Includes Parity Ethereum client as well so you can switch between both clients
* Includes other components of the Ethereum framework such as **Status.im, Raiden, IPFS and Swarm**
* Includes an **APT repository** for upgrading Ethereum packages by running **apt-get install command** (e.g. sudo apt-get install geth)

# Ethereum software installed

* Geth: 1.9.6 (official binary)
* Parity: 2.5.9 (cross compiled)
* Swarm: 0.5.2 (official binary)
* Raiden Network: 0.200.0\~rc1 (official binary)
* IPFS: 0.4.22 (official binary)
* Status.im: 0.34.0\~beta3 (cross compiled)
* Vipnode: 2.3 (official binary)

# Requirements

* Raspberry Pi 4 model B (4GB)
* Micro SD Card
* SSD disk with USB 3.0 (See USB SSD disk section)
* Power Supply
* Ethernet cable
* (Optional but strongly recommended) Case with a heatsink and a fan.
* (Optional but strongly recommended) 30303 Port forwarding

# Download and install instructions

**Download Raspberry Pi 4 image**

[https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image\_2019-10-26-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/image_2019-10-26-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip)

md5sum 172dd37c30e4ae734ff39b45f5e5a33c

**Flashing the MicroSD (Linux command line)**

    unzip image_2019-10-20-EthRaspbian2.0-lite.zip
    sudo dd bs=1M  if=2019-10-20-EthRaspbian2.0-lite of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fdatasync status=progress

Once flashed, insert de MicroSD, connect the SSD USB disk (blue port), the ethernet cable and power up the Raspberry.

**Disclaimer: Keep in mind that your entire USB disk will be wiped out.**

For further info regarding installation and usage please visit Ethereum on ARM Github page \[1\]

# USB SSD disk

There are **2 options** for the SSD storage:

Use a **USB portable SSD disk** such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD (as seen on this fantastic step-by-step guide to **run a full node on the RPi4 by Gr√©goire Jeanmart**) \[7\]

Use a **USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk**. In my case I used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011 \[8\] with a Kingston SSD A400 (480 GB) \[9\]. Be sure to buy a case with an **UAS compliant chip**, particularly, one of these: **JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E)**

Keep in mind that **you need to plug the disk to a USB 3.0 port (blue)**

# Fast Sync data

These are the numbers of the Raspberry Pi 4 Fast sync:

* Sync time: 4 days and 2 hours
* Total state entries downloaded: 391M
* Total DB size: 178 GB

# Other considerations

30303 port forwarding is a must, otherwise, the sync process will be far more slow.

Try to get a case with a fan and a heatsink to prevent CPU throttle (during sync, the temperature can go over 80 ¬∫C without a cooling system). There are lots of cases out there (like this one \[10\]).

The 2Gb model may work but you probably need to tweak Geth memory usage (I'm a little skeptical here, though). Try to reduce the --cache value in /etc/ethereum/geth.conf file. The swap memory config is in /etc/dphys-swapfile. Feel free to report here your feedback.

Take into account that fast sync depends on several factors: Disk throughput, network bandwidth, RAM memory, disk cache... so total sync time may differ between users. For the Raspberry Pi 4, expect between 3-5 days for the sync process to complete.

It seems that there may be an issue with memory management \[11\]. I got some errors during the sync process related to RAM  (though it doesn't stop the sync as systemd respawns the process). It turns out that Geth can't handle 512MB of cache in the RP4 (it is set now to 256MB) while ARM64 devices (with 4GB of RAM as well) run with more than 1GB of cache with no problem whatsoever. In you run into this, please, report here or in Github your feedback.

Finally. A few days ago, at Devcon 5, Joseph Lubin set a goal of 1M developers working on the Ethereum ecosystem by Devcon 6. If this is achievable (I think it is), can we get a fraction of these users to run a full node? It just takes a MicroSD flash...

1614802059,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lx32kv/expectations_for_backwardsincompatible_changes/,64,100,"The time between now and the merge, and possibly a little bit after the merge, is going to be a time of significant change for the Ethereum protocol. **These changes are needed for many reasons**: proof of stake and scalability, others to enable stateless validation, and others to simplify the protocol and make it easier to maintain it in the long term, all **setting the stage for a more sustainable long-term Ethereum protocol**. However, **some of these changes are backwards-incompatible, in that they may break existing applications or render them uneconomical**.

In all cases, these incompatibilities affect only a small portion of use cases, and there are alternative ways to get the same functionality, but nevertheless it's important to talk about these proposals early, so that developers have as much of a heads up as possible, and so that we have as much time as possible to refine the proposals to minimize disruption.

**After the merge** and the other important changes that are already in the roadmap today are complete, **I continue to think that it would be valuable for the Ethereum protocol to ""ossify""**, changing much less going forward so as to maximize developers' feeling of stability and ability to rely on protocol features. However, such an ossification is best done *after* we take into account our learnings from the past 6 years and make this one last push to make some major improvements to Ethereum.

This is my attempt at a partial listing of some changes that may happen.

See also: [this doc](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing), though the actual changes proposed there only cover the EVM, and this post is broader.

## History storage changes

* After the Ethereum application state is moved over to the beacon chain as part of **the merge**, we may want to discard the ethereum PoW chain, and no longer support any transaction or history queries going back into the PoW chain. **This greatly simplifies clients, as they can simply forget all the pre-merge protocol rules** and thus have a smaller and leaner codebase going forward, but it does mean that dapps that rely on looking back into history need to find some other way to do so.
* Even outside of the context of the merge, **we likely want to move toward a model where ""the network"" is only expected to be responsible for the most recent 1 year of history (including txs/blocks/receipts)**. This prevents clients from incurring ever-growing storage burdens, but it does once again mean that dapps that require old history will need an alternative way to get it.

## Statelessness / state expiry

See [my other post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lw7ug3/weak_statelessness_andor_state_expiry_coming_soon/).

State expiry is definitely likely to be the one change in this list that requires the most significant changes for contracts; contracts that do not change probably will not *break* (as the most recent state expiry schemes ensure that if you can find a witness, you can continue using existing contracts as is for as long as you want), but developers *will* likely need to build new versions of contracts to remain gas-efficient.

## EVM changes

* [**EIP 2929**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929) **(going into the upcoming Berlin hard fork)**, changing how SLOAD and calls/account accesses are priced. The first time an account or storage slot is accessed is now about 3x more expensive, but subsequent accesses are around 5-10x cheaper. On average, this only increases gas costs paid by users by \~0.3%, but it significantly improves the chain's DoS resistance and bounds on witness size.
* **Gas repricing for code witness size**: when we add code Merklization, to finish the job of bounding witness size we will need to charge some cost per chunk of code accessed in a transaction (eg. 400 gas per 32 byte chunk accessed). In general, this would somewhat increase the gas cost of ""simpler"" transactions (eg. an ERC20 approval accessed about 16 chunks so about 6.4k gas would be added) but it would only negligibly affect more complex transactions that loop over the same code many times. Gas limits can be adjusted upwards so that on average scalability remains the same as it was before, but even still, some applications may need to be rewritten to remain economical.
* **Removal or neutering of SELFDESTRUCT**: see [this whole document](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/selfdestruct) for the rationale.
* [**Removal of refunds**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) (proposed for the London hard fork), or limiting how refunds work, with the main goals of reducing block gas usage variance and freeing up blockchain space and storage being used by gastoken contracts.
* [**Removal of the 2300 gas stipend**](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/evm_feature_removing#The-2300-gas-stipend): a simplification to the protocol, removing a hard-coded value and hence making future gas cost changes more feasible
* **Replacing some precompiles with EVM code implementations**: this could be done mainly to simplify the protocol and the client code complexity, but it would inevitably come with gas cost changes.

## Miscellaneous

* **Ethereum is switching from RLP + hexary Patricia trees to SSZ and possibly Verkle trees**. This means that contracts that verify Merkle proofs into history will stop working at some point and will need to be rewritten. To allow developers to make Merkle proofs going forward, one possible route is to make an explicit ""history/state proof verification precompile"", so that whenever the state structure changes the precompile can change too, but of course this has not yet been implemented.
* **Block hashes will no longer be a good source of randomness** after the merge.
* The `DIFFICULTY` opcode will be useless after the merge (duh)
* **In the long run, quantum computers will break ECDSA and BLS**, and so everything that uses ECDSA or BLS will have to switch, and even ethereum 2.0 itself will have to move from BLS to a post-quantum aggregable signature scheme. **Fortunately, there has been a lot of work done recently by Starkware and others on making such schemes more efficient**, so we are very confident that we will survive the transition; but contract developers should necessarily be aware that this will happen.

There are likely items that I have missed, but this covers at least some of the important things that are worth watching out for. I highly encourage application developers and others to participate in this process and do so early, so that the protocol changes that end up happening can be done in a way that is as minimally disruptive as possible.",ethereum,Expectations for backwards-incompatible changes / removal of features that may come soon

Amazing Venue and amazing organization.  Everything ran super smoothly.  Please bring back those organizers for next year.   

&amp;#x200B;

Now for Devcon 5.... 

1)  It seems like 80-90% of the attendees are from North America or Europe. 

The EF did not do any due diligence on the geographical location of the attendees and for some reason decided to host Devcon 5 on the other side of the world.   This means that 4000-5000 people had to buy expensive plane tickets (thousands of dollars) to unnecessarily burn carbon and invert their timezones for a 3.5 day conference.

The average flight from New York to Japan burns about 2.5 Metric Tons of carbon.   A rough estimate would put the **carbon cost** for Devcon 5 at **8,000-12,000  METRIC TONS** of CO2 emissions!   

Vitalik,  Aya,   and EF.... Can we please be responsible global citizens and do some basic research on the geographical location of attendees and chose a geographical location that will minimize the carbon cost of the conference next year?  The Earth thanks you!

2) There is no Wifi at the conference.  This is simply unacceptable.  5000 tickets x 1000 euros is 5 million euros in revenue.  And there's no Wifi.  Whoever is responsible for this simply can not be in charge of next years devcon.  We paid 1000 euros.

3)  The venue is quite poor.   It's far from main area of downtown, and it's in a mall with multiple entrances on multiple floors.  There is a basement level and then elevators to floor 6 for other rooms.   There is no security.  There are no badges with names of attendees.  There are only wristbands.   Anyone can just walk into this conference easily without a ticket. 

4)  They ran out of food tickets.   People had to go and buy lunch themselves which were supposed to be included.

5) There are Ethereum competitors speaking on the main stage.  Is this a Crypto conference or an Ethereum conference?    Will we invite EOS to Devcon 6?   We paid 1000 euros to hear other blockchains shill their blockchains.  Come on... 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that everything else is great. Lots of awesome talks, etc.

1570577337,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/df8c0m/this_years_devcon_is_disappointing/,54,72,"1) It's right in the middle of nowhere. 
2) Half of the conference is in basement and other half on the 6th floor with normal businesses on the other floors. There are often long queues for elevators.
3) They ran out of food vouchers and sim cards. So no food and Internet for me apparently. Did they not know how many people bought the tickets?
4) The rooms are quite small and room for every good talk is full to its brim. No place to even stand.
5) The wifi does not work. It's always full. I had to use hotspot from my mobile to load my slides.
6) There's no live streaming (except main stage maybe) and some rooms don't even have a setup for recording.

That being said, Japan is beautiful, the community is awesome and after parties are litt so it's not all grim but it's certainly not as good as last year's devcon.

Perhaps this is because Japan is waaay more expensive than Prague. Nobody forced EF to do devcon in Japan though. They could have done it in a relatively cheap place like Bali or Bangkok.

As a college student, I really still have no idea what to do with my future career. The only thing that I have ever been seriously interested in is crypto and specifically IOV and IOT. I enjoyed learning about and monitoring all things IOV and IOT, but apart form buying tokens and assets, there really isn't much else I am doing in the space. For the amount of time I put into crypto, I'd like to know of some other ways to either help grow the ecosystem or attempt to make this time into some useful knowledge or profit. I know there are so many ways to help out by developing, but as someone who isn't creative, I have no idea what to develop. I just feel like this tech is a great importunity not only as a monetary investment, but a lifelong one too. This could finally be the thing I am looking for that will give me a future where I actually care about what I'm doing, I just don't really know how to get started.

1570926149,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/dh3bcn/synchronous_vs_asynchronous_crossshard/,30,57,"I just attended Devcon and spent a lot of time listening to concern about composability across shards. !  


From a developer standpoint, I don't see asynchronicity as problematic.  It's simply something we will need to live with to move to a sharding system.   Nearly all DeFi will naturally get deployed wherever the Maker contracts live (which may just remain on the current ETH1 chain as it becomes a shard), and composability will remain the same as it is today...on that shard.  The cost of using this  urban ""ETH1 / DeFi City"" will likely be much higher than the suburban shards, but that's okay!  A FairWin style ponzi scheme will naturally choose a low cost shard to blow up on without affecting the major shards (speaking of which, we should also build in a throttle to prevent a single contract from using more than 20% of a block's gas)

I believe we should accept that cross shard communication is not perfectly composable.   It's so much more important to move to PoS quickly and get some significant scalability for silo-style dapps (e.g. a gambling app, or ticketing app) which do not need to communicate often across shards.  There's simply no need to evenly distribute the load and fee pricing across shards.  

Taken to a more simple ""extreme"", perhaps the *only* cross-shard activity should be the transfer of ETH and other assets, initiated by users who will decide which shard they wish to do business in.  *A contract on one shard does not need to directly call a contract on another shard.*    

Let's move full-steam ahead with PoS and shards as silos.    Each shard can likely have 10x the throughput that ETH1 currently has, if we optimize using a low shard count and punt on complex cross-shard communication.  The whole system will naturally scale 100x by virtue of people using the cheaper shards.  We don't need 1024x any time soon!   Technical purity should take a backseat to the market needs.",ethereum,Synchronous vs Asynchronous cross-shard communication

What the Streamr devs have done is to build generic infrastructure to allow individuals to monetize their data.  As everyone knows, this infrastructure exists only for b2b data sales (think Bloomberg or Thomson Reuters). But not for individuals. If you want to sell your data, you basically have to download it all and sell it on eBay. That's where we are in 2019. This lack of infrastructure for individuals to monetize their data is the main reason we live in the Panopticon society we currently inhabit. Individuals have no property rights over their data ergo, no money, no privacy, no respect, and no power. We're all info-slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

The [Swash app](http://swashapp.io) is the first app (but by no means the only one) to be built on top of Streamr's infrastructure. Last week it got demonstrated at Mozfest.  Swash's first version is now [ available for Firefox users](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/swash/) only. (Chrome, Brave and Edge versions to follow very soon as I understand it).    


![img](6nlzu80m9fw31 ""Streamr co-founder Henri Pihkala demo-ing Swash and Data Unions at Mozfest, Oct 2019"")

So what does Swash do? Basically you can earn crypto for your browsing and social media data. Users simply install the browser plugin, customise their privacy settings and then through the Swash plugin, you (and everyone else who is a Swash operator) sends the data you choose to be aggregated, to a data firehose on [Streamr's Marketplace](https://streamr.network/marketplace). Streamr is calling this a Data Union.   


Why aggregate the data into a firehose? Because on its own, your data holds little value, but combine it with others into a Data Union and you gain strong collective power to generate revenue for each contributor and shape the future of data ecosystem. 

When that data firehose sells to buyers (all these transactions are  recorded on the  Ethereum blockchain btw) everyone gets a share of the money as distributed through a smart contract - NOT through a centralised provider. This is why the whole Streamr set up is different to projects like Wibson. It is permissionless and decentralized.  

Illustrator Maggie Appleton loved what she saw and drew this (thank you!).  

![img](b2iw77fb9fw31 ""Illustrator Maggie Appleton loved Data Unions and drew this to help explain it all."")

&amp;#x200B;

A brief mention about what going on at layer 0. Streamr's p2p Network is the underlying infrastructure empowering the data aggregation and transport for apps like Swash. In order to make it easy for any developer to create a Data Union for their users, Streamr [released their Monoplasma payment](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-scaling-tech-monoplasma-wants-to-let-dapps-broadcast-crypto) solution to handle one-to-many micropayments efficiently in Feb this year. Basically, that made it feasible for a data stream to be composed of hundreds of thousands if not millions of users whilst still enjoying the advantages offered by decentralized technologies. 

The notion of crowdselling data is new, but the implications are that it provides a step towards data ownership and better user rights. It is also a middle ground approach between blindly offering it for free to big tech in exchange for access to their services and envisioning a future where no data is shared at all. You can meet the team behind the plugin and learn more about their motivations and ambitions for Swash in this video.   


![video](ydsigpb5ffw31 ""Swash - the world's first Data Union!"")

So will Swash be Ethereum's killer app? Well mainstream conversations around data have never been more vibrant, and loathing of centralised data giants like Facebook, never greater. This app is positioning itself as a solution to many of the problems in that conversation. And because it's so easy to use from a crypto perspective - no onboarding/KYC etc - and because it actually makes you money from a legit source, it's got every chance of getting more than a few thousand users. Of course Swash (and actually Streamr's first version of their underlying infrastructure) doesn't launch until March 2020. Until that point, I'd expect to see Swash's first 50 users turn into a very healthy stream of early adopters.",ethereum,Ethereum's killer app?

Reddit admin [u/jarins](https://www.reddit.com/u/jarins/) here, with some exciting news to share today: Reddit has teamed up with the Ethereum Foundation to establish Reddit‚Äôs first-ever blockchain partnership!

As Reddit continues to grow with more than 50 million daily users and hundreds of thousands of communities, the platform has long maintained a decentralized ethos by empowering users to create, govern, and grow their own communities. Through this partnership, we will be increasing our commitment to blockchain, accelerating scaling and resources for the Ethereum ecosystem, and bringing the value and independence of blockchain technology to millions of redditors.

In many ways, this collaboration started with the [Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/) that we hosted in this community with the Ethereum Foundation. In this new stage of our partnership, immediate efforts will be focused on bringing Ethereum to Reddit-scale production. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large-scale applications like Community Points on Ethereum. The scaling technology developed through this partnership will be open-sourced and publicly available for anyone to use.

We introduced [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. Built on Ethereum, Community Points represent a user‚Äôs ownership in a community and rewards them for their individual contributions (such as posts and comments). This project is our first attempt at utilizing decentralized technology to empower individuals to have a sense of accountability and more ownership in the communities that they create and contribute to. Community Points are currently in beta on the Rinkeby network and are being tested in [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) and [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/).

Our blockchain efforts will be led by Reddit's Crypto team (hi!). We are currently [hiring](https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit/jobs/2419120) great backend engineers who want to build the decentralized Internet. If you‚Äôre interested in solving tough problems like scaling and bringing blockchain to millions of users, send me a PM or apply directly on Reddit‚Äôs careers page -- we‚Äôd love to talk to you!

We‚Äôre looking forward to working closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and contributing more to the broader Ethereum ecosystem -- and we hope to share some exciting announcements over the next few months.

People are freaking out about fee basis for transactions on ethereum and how ETH 2 won‚Äôt solve this. You are not quite correct.

Here are three developers actively working on products in the trenches being asked direct no BS questions about what will fix this and can we use Ethereum NETWORK for low cost transactions.

https://youtu.be/PuZ8kUueG10

Watching this, you will probably not understand 90% of what they are talking about. Look at this video like getting to interview engineers at Apple as they are inventing the first iPhone and trying to follow along with what they are talking about in terms of their stack and how they will use various protocols to achieve their goals. Don‚Äôt expect to know every word but I loved it and it‚Äôs made me read a lot more into this.

TLDR: ethereum will exist as a world network that has gas fees. On top of that robust security will sit l2 dapps that make use of new cost saving methods to bring your transaction costs to pennies. They will use roll ups to achieve much of this. These products EXIST. And they are currently live and FUNCTIONING. They simply haven‚Äôt reached the mainstream conciousness yet.

1.) loopring allows for transactions at two orders of magnitude cheaper than current uses.

2. Synthetix is looking at around 1/100th price vs current prices.

NFT trading/buying in game and in dapp will leverage methods like this along the way to being on chain exhange costs to ZERO. 

These are various ways in which as the network dapps and platforms evolve they will bring the ultimate cost per user down to pennies.

In the short term, users are looking for things like binance or other exchanges as ways to cheaply trade. Correct, that is a centralized exchange built on a copy of Ethereum a blockchain technology, copy paste. They built it and solved fee issues by keeping you on chain with their token. Ethereum is not a trading portal in this way just now. Ethereum is a network for moving financial liquidity and other NFT around from place to place. It‚Äôs also much more.

At some point, you will have to pay to on ramp, and pay to off ramp, from the network. That will use gas. But your gas fees will shrink drastically by using the new tools and platforms which are running in Ethereum network.

Binance is a trading portal for penny stock cryptos.

Ethereum is a new world computer that securely and in a decentralized way allows you to transact financially across many platforms. You will interact with Ethereum network through many platforms. Ethereum is like the roads and highways of the world financial system, and they cost to use. The dapps sitting on top of the network are like little neighborhoods or cities or towns that you can use freely or next to free so long as you are still on the highway. 

It seems, and I am a noob, so listen to the pros, but You are suffering high fees right now because we are trying to use the system as a get on and off with every transaction and that is not what the system is.

You are buying the future of the internet. You are buying the next financial system. It is literally being invented as we speak.

Those who just want to trade crypto penny tokens should not use Ethereum right now. Within a year, you can use loopring via an exchange for such a thing but you are literally that early that it is being built.

It‚Äôs easy to copy the code remove then removed the decentralized component and make a trading exchange like binance. Might as well buy crypto on Robinhood. At least you get a wallet but it‚Äôs still not under your control if they want to manipulate the market. 

This is how early you are. There is SO. MUCH. MONEY. To be made with ethereum that your eyeballs are going to pop out of your head as an INVESTOR. If you are a short term trader... you‚Äôre early and are going to pay fees. If you‚Äôre looking to use Ethereum like PayPal TODAY, you are early. But within a year as the new roll ups take effect, the services which leverage roll ups built on top of Ethereum will drive your costs down and increase adoption.

You are that early. Hodl.

I‚Äôm sure some of this is not perfectly described but please do yourself a favor and watch the video. These are pros making the new world financial system and there is nothing close to the developer interest in this platform vs others. You may be right, the average day trader doesn‚Äôt care about decentralization, but the people building a world net financial and asset system DO. ‚ÄúIf I asked people what they wanted... they would have said a faster horse.‚Äù",ethereum,TLDR DD: Ethereum is not in danger. 1/100th price transactions are around the corner.

1614273634,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/lsbosf/the_future_is_optimistic/,189,207,"As you all know, Ethereum has been struggling with congestion and high fees. This has been anticipated for a while now so the past few years the development community has been working hard on a solution. This March Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) will have their public release.

# Why this matters

A quick ELI5 and history of scaling solutions for Ethereum and why this is a HUGE development. There are several kinds of scalability solutions for Ethereum: State channels like Plasma, sidechains, or rollups.

State channels are only usable for simple transfers so they are of no use for scaling smart contracts. Sidechains are essentially a separate blockchain with their own set of validators; and mostly the number of validators is quite low which introduces centralization issues.

Enter Optimistic Rollups. They support the EVM which means they can scale smart contracts. Optimism can do anywhere from 500 - 2000 TPS (current is \~14-34), with super low fees (less than a cent), while maintaining security and decentralization.

Further, Optimistic Rollups do not have a token so all gas on the rollup will be paid in ETH, keeping utility with the token and a better user experience.

# Path to adoption

Starting in March, any existing dApp on Ethereum can literally copy/paste their code to Optimism with little changes and get going. They made the process extremely easy with a compiler that developers can just plug in their existing Solidity code and it automatically ports everything to be Optimistic compatible.

Currently Synthetix is on Optimistic as a limited release. Uniswap, Chainlink, and Compound have already announced they will also migrate to Optimistic. With those large applications there and the easy of migration, a significant part of Ethereum's ecosystem will move there as well. Uniswap already has a demo of their Optimistic implementation, [Unipig](https://unipig.exchange/join-team), which has actually been released for a year. Once ORU is released in March it likely won't be long before we start seeing a flurry of announcements of projects migrating over.

There's still fees to get to L2 from L1, though. A key component to making this transition as seamless, easy, and affordable as possible is getting wallet providers on board to withdraw funds directly to L2. Coinbase has indicated support for Optimism, which means many users will never have to touch Layer 1. [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/), an open source wallet protocol that many projects use, already has an alpha build ([see preview](https://imgur.com/a/Ee09Ryf)) with Optimistic Rollups integrated.

This effectively eliminates the high gas fee issue for Ethereum without sacrificing decentralization. It's what everyone has been waiting for, and it's here in March!

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** L2 adoption is coming much faster than everyone thinks. Optimistic Rollups will be open to public in March. Uniswap, Compound, and Chainlink will join Synthetix on Optimistic and others will follow. Coinbase and other wallets will support direct withdraws to Optimistic L2. Users can deposit their funds with a single transaction and then enjoy the complete ecosystem of Ethereum with extremely low gas fees and high TPS, while being entirely noncustodial and decentralized.",ethereum,The Future Is Optimistic!

## Why Gas Prices are High

Simply put, Ethereum is getting more and more popular! Every day, we see new users starting projects in NFTs / digital art, DeFi, governance - all with passionate communities that want to use Ethereum mainnet. It's been amazing to watch the usecases grow over the past few years.

At the end of the day, this means competition between users. Gas prices are subject to their own markets of supply and demand. When there are a lot of users trying to send transactions, gas prices will increase to reflect that.

This is easy to see in times of high volatility. For example, with the recent drop in ETH price on Feb 23, gas spiked to over **1000 gwei** as people tried to move their DeFi positions and arbitrage bots cleaned up market imbalances.

Having a market for block inclusion (measured by gas prices) is important because blockspace is limited. This means that there's a cap to what can be included per block. [Here's a chart](https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit) of the block gas limit over time. If there wasn't a limit to the size of blocks, then any sort of data could be put onchain for near 0 cost - this would break the chain.

In the near term, high gas prices may fluctuate, but over the long term, mainnet Ethereum may see sustained high gas prices when compared to previous years. Emerging Layer 2 solutions, which package many thousands of transactions to settle back to mainnet, will be able to pay a much higher gas price.

## What are L2s and which ones should you try?

L2 stands for ""Layer 2"" - this is a big umbrella term for chain constructions linked to a base chain (Layer 1) in some way. While there's a wide range of designs, they all offload some of the demand from mainnet Ethereum while maintaining some or most of the security guarantees.

We're so excited about L2s because they will bring a new flavor of scaling before the merge with Eth2 is ready. Scaling means lower transaction fees! Here's a list of L2s that are live now or soon that you can try out. Remember, even though these protocols are promising, they are still early versions that will need to be battle hardened over time.

* ZkRollups
   * [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/) \- Exchange and Payment Protocol
   * StarkEx - Starkware based Exchange that hosts [Deversifi](https://www.deversifi.com/) (Exchange), Immutable (NFTs), and [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (perpetual contracts)
   * [zKSync](https://zksync.io/) \- scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum
* Optimistic Rollups
   * [Arbitrum](https://portal.arbitrum.io/) (on testnet) - rollup built by [Offchain Labs](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs)
   * [Fuel](https://fuel.sh/) \- ""Fuel empowers any person on Earth with fast, secure, and cost efficient ERC-20 transfers and swaps using the world‚Äôs most efficient Optimistic Rollup""
   * [Optimism](https://optimism.io/) (live in March) - Instant transactions and scalable smart contracts
* Sidechains (Technically not L2, but they are often used for similar purposes)
   * [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (fka [Matic](https://matic.network/)) - a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks
   * [xDAI](https://www.xdaichain.com/) \- a stable payments blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive stable transactions

## Are other chains as good as they claim?

You may also heard other chains claiming ""come to \_\_\_\_ chain, we've got  low / no fees!!""  While on the surface it may seem appealing, there's probably more being left unsaid. A few potential explanations:

* They cut corners on decentralization - most frequently by increasing the hardware or bandwidth requirements for nodes. Ethereum takes this very seriously, and will only scale responsibly.
* They are hiding the true costs - like requiring users to stake funds to send transactions
* They will eventually run into the same issues as Ethereum - more users will inevitably lead to more congestion.

## Other Initiatives

* Near Term (weeks / months):
   * [Turbogeth](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/) \- this is an experimental Ethereum client that rearchitected Geth to create a more performant client. Everyone should try to run a Turbogeth node to help them get ready for a full release! The strategies for state management TG is using, once present in other client implementations, may allow for a safe increase to the block gas limit while also maintaining the ability for consumer hardware to run nodes.
* Medium term (\~4 months)
   * Eip-1559 - Potentially being included in the London network upgrade in July, 1559 comes with a whole host of benefits
      * more predictable tx inclusion (important for L2s like rollups)
      * elastic blocksize
      * reduce some MEV
      * balance issuance w/ burn: a potentially steady cap asset that is still secure
      * in protocol congestion oracle - (very important for L2s like rollups)
* Long term (\~12 months)
   * Eth2 - Proof of Stake, also called Serenity will also increase the total available blockspace through sharding. The Beacon Chain (the first piece of Eth2) is already live since December 2020, and the first hard fork is expected in mid-2021. The merge, projected for Q4 2021 / Q1 2022, will unite Eth1 and Eth2.

## What you can do to help

To start, point people to this post - this info is only useful if it gets in front of people!

Comment your gas suggestions / hacks - I'll make sure to update the list at the top with the best ones.

You can also try out the L2 solutions as they go live, give feedback about the onboarding experience, and ask exchanges to support withdrawing directly to L2s. This will improve the experience for the existing community and everyone else coming soon.

Prior to this it had crashed almost just as much. But then through 2017 we went from $1300 to $20,000 which is a 15x increase. We then crashed back to $3000 which is a 6x loss. Then we became $58,000 over the following 3 years which is a 19x increase.

Ethereum had a very similar trajectory. Explosive growth in 2017 then to crash 10x from $1000 to $100, and then we 20x'd to $2000.

Do you see a pattern here? This is crypto. One minute you're up 10x and the next you're down 6x, then after awhile you're up 20x. It's ten steps forward six steps back, then twenty steps forward. Maybe we'll hit $4,000 this runup, maybe we wont! **But we sure will next run**. This is based on **9 YEARS** of market behavior in bitcoin, and then ETH from 2015 onward.

Another important thing to note too is **BIG NUMBERS** and orders of magnitude. Bitcoin going from $100 to $200 was a HUGE DEAL, it 2x'd! But once it got into the thousands, going from $7,000 to $10,000 was not as big a deal, even though if you held since $100 that delta would've been epic for you in terms of profit. My point is, as ethereum's value goes up **it will go up in terms of dollars faster** because the numbers just get bigger and so too do the swings.

This means: we're still *early* here based on all the data. And if you hodl your ETH then you'll really start to benefit from those big numbers once we start hitting them. We're very excited this year to go up hundreds of dollars. When we're at $4,000 we're going to be having a conversation of *moving up thousands of dollars*. And suddenly that sub-$2000 ETH you bought is worth a fortune.",ethtrader,"üöÄ ETH is going to hit $4,000 and it's going to do so EASILY üöÄ"

Ethereum has been in development for nearly a decade and I expect is 5+ years away from reaching its true potential. Don't come here looking for a quick flip. It's important not to focus to heavily on the present price of ether in dollars (which admittedly I myself have struggled with lately as the price has jumped higher yet again) as the potential upside in the near to long term will likely dwarf any present price action. Focus instead on increasing your eth position through regular buys and compounding your holdings. If you are buying into ethereum realize you are investing in the development of a platform that is still very much in beta and its proper 'launch' is likely still 5+ years out. Your purchasing ethereum injects funding into the ecosystem and further incentivizes the development of the end product(s). Your reward for your investment is proportional ownership in the future value of the ethereum ecosystem, but it will likely take years for that to reach its full potential. There is no wrong time to buy and trying to time the market is a mistake. Any investment in ethereum near term is going to be a good one long term IMHO. 

The potential of the platform being developed cannot be understated. We are building a decentralized, trustless computing marketplace with applications extending far beyond the current offerings of DeFI and NFTs. Trying to predict the scope and scale of the services that may ultimately come to reside on the ethereum platform is akin to making predictions of the early internet itself. Yes the platform at present has many limitations and problems to be sorted out (looking at you gas fees...). If the past is any indication of the future I have no doubt these problems will be ironed out. Some of the best and brightest in computer science have made this their life's work and I have complete confidence in their ultimate success. Ten years from now we will look back at this version of the network the way one might look back at how shitty the internet was on a spotty dialup connection. There are already solid plans in place to alleviate nearly all of the existing bottlenecks. 

tl;dr: Frame your investment mindset for Ethereum as a long term play. There is no telling where we will be 5+ years from now but anything less than multiples of todays price is unlikely given the revolutionary utility of the future Ethereum ecosystem.",ethtrader,"Investing in Ethereum is a Decade(s) long startup commitment, not a 'get rich quick' play"

You can claim it for free if you hold any DeFi tokens like LINK, UNI, SNX, etc: [LOTTO Claim Page](https://www.lotto.finance/claim)

One thing you learn from being in this space for awhile is that people are lazy and have at most 7 second attention spans. So I decided to make a lottery that is literally as simple as possible. All you do is acquire the token, LOTTO, and **then do nothing.** The lottery code built into the token itself.

Every day around 5 PM, the startGame() function is called, which does a -1 LOTTO to all user balances, pools that LOTTO together, and gives all the tokens to a user selected at random. So with this lottery token, you may check your balance and have thousands of LOTTO just appear in there.

It's really entertaining, it launched on Monday and we're on lottery #4 today. If you guys like this idea, then grab some for free from the portal above if you're eligible and join the party. I'll answer any questions you guys may have about it as well.

It just listed on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/token/0xb0dfd28d3cf7a5897c694904ace292539242f858) as well :)",ethtrader,"I've created an Ethereum ""lottery token""- once a day, it automatically removes 1 token from all users' balances, pools them together, and then distributes them to one user at random.

ETH got the fundamentals: Ethereum is the largest blockchain dev community, runs most of the hackathons, leads in corporate adoption, ERC20 Tether, DEFI adoption in China, South America, ...

But still the price of ETH seems undervalued compared to BTC &amp; Alts. And mainstream news write about bitcoin and payments more than Ethereum and what people are building on top - Stablecoins, lending, DAOs, social recovery... 

So why is that?

**Bitcoin and Alts simply are better at telling their stories**. Bitcoin is a meme and Alts are literally only focused on marketing. While Ethereum projects mainly push their own agenda, instead of Ethereum as a brand.

What if there was a **marketingDAO**, which could fund small proposals for people to work on. Aka **pool ETH to pump ETH**. 

Some projects we could fund:

* Push Ethereum Foundation to optimize [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org) SEO
* Help MakerDAO &amp; friends to push payment meme into web2
* Push mainstream media to write about ETH
* Fund cyber punk videos on Ethereum. Remember those visionary 2016 posts about a future world with Ethereum?
* Fund local teams to represent Ethereum at conferences

We are two friends who quit our day jobs last year to fulfill an old dream to start our own company.

A year and many long nights later, we have built a Fantasy Football platform built on Loom Network with a bridge to Ethereum. Our Player Cards are non fungible tokens and we have official partnerships with football clubs (currently around 30, with 60 top clubs to be announced by the end of the year) and the support of gaming giant Ubisoft.

Currently we are in Beta testing and we are looking for help to test our platform. That's where you fellow redditors come in.

We have made 100 seats for redditors where you will receive a free Rare Player Card upon registration and an extra one for every friend you invite to play. You can use your Player Cards to register for weekly tournaments with real prizes involved.

Now when it comes to ticketing on blockchain, there's only one project to think of: **GET protocol**.

&amp;#x200B;

***An introduction:***

&amp;#x200B;

In my humble opinion GET protocol is the **a very undervalued** project when it comes to fundamentals, adoption, tokenomics and potential. Let me explain why:

# GET protocol solves an enormous problem: ticket scalping

I think we're all tired of the practices in the ticketing space: bots buy up tickets instantly and then resell them 2x, 5x, 10x or even more the original ticket price. Fans lose, artists lose, venues lose, ... while the money ends up in the pocket of scalpers who don't add any value to the process.

[The secondary ticketing market is worth $15 billion. How long will fans have to pay?](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/scalping)

**GET protocol elminates ticket scalping** by linking the ticket to your mobile phone. This means that at entry to a concert, sports game, ... you are only permitted entry with your mobile phone.

They have **sold over 600k tickets** and not one was ""scalped""

An example is famous Dutch artist Jochem Myjer who uses GET protocol integrator GUTS tickets:

[https://twitter.com/jochemmyjer/status/1118589335060848641](https://twitter.com/jochemmyjer/status/1118589335060848641)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;‚ÄúWeird how some venues still don‚Äôt get how great GUTS is. And are afraid of change. It‚Äôs easier for the audience. For artists there is no more reselling. And maaaany other advantages. #GoWithTheTimes‚Äù

The ticketing space is one where **no one trusts another** in terms of how many tickets were issued, what the original price was, ... It has been proven that even Ticketmaster themselves are involved in the scalping business. That's why **blockchain** is vital in all of this. The tickets are all **registered on the blockchain** as a mean of **transparency** and **accountability**. This means that fans can check **ticket authenticity** whenever they want and make sure that they aren't being taken for a ride.

Besides scalping it offers many more advantages to integrators:

* **Interaction** with the ticket holders
* Extra **marketing** tools
* **Data** collection
* **Dynamic price** setting
* **Merging** of the primary and secondary market
* ...

# GET protocol has a lot of adoption

As stated above, GUTS has sold 600k tickets using GET protocol. In the meanwhile more ticketing companies have started using it:

**GUTS**

Runs fully on the GET protocol and has sold over **600.000** **tickets**. Has grown into the biggest ticketeer in the Netherlands.[https://guts.tickets](https://guts.tickets/)

**ITIX**

Established in 2009 and sells **2 million tickets/year**. Is fully integrated in the GET protocol and will start selling GET-fueled tickets soon.[https://www.itix.nl](https://www.itix.nl/)

**getTicket**

A new ticketing company in **South Korea** that will run fully on the GET protocol. They already have deals with **kpop** stars to sell tickets for.[http://getticket.kr](http://getticket.kr/)

**TecTix**

A Germany based ticketing company that will sell GET fueled tickets with a focus on the **sports industry**.[https://tec-tix.com](https://tec-tix.com/)

**Wicket**

The last to join is an **Italian** ticketing company. Despite being new they have already ticketed the **Milano Wine festival** in 2020 and will do so in 2021 as well. In 2019 this festival atracted more than 300.000 visitors.[https://www.wicketevents.com](https://www.wicketevents.com/)

**Integrating** an existing ticketing company is a **low investment move** (only the GET token is needed) that offers traditional ticketing companies several benefits. With the whitelabel that has just been released, which makes it easy for any ticketing company to start using GET, I expect many ticketing companies to integrate and GET to **scale quickly**.

Here are the requests they had received by end of 2019:

&amp;#x200B;

# GET tokenomics

The GET **tokenomics** are built so that for every ticket issued **0,28‚Ç¨ (or 0,34$) worth of GET is needed by the ticketeers**. They buy most of this from **exchanges** and a minority they get subsidized from the User Grotwh Fund. In 2020 around 70% was bought directly from exchanges.

In 2020 ticketing volume in general was down like 90‚Äì99% due to corona. Yet GET managed to sell over **236k** tickets. Or an **increase** of **27%** compared to 2019.

This is a major indicator of their **usecase** being **needed**: despite covid19 they grew a lot and conquered a lot of marketshare from traditional ticketeers.

***Tokenomics to push the price***

If GUTS was able to sell 236k tickets in a year where ticketing volume is down at least 90% then I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that they‚Äôll sell **over 3 million tickets/year** once everything is allowed again.

Add the **new ticketing companies** that integrated GET recently (getticket in **Korea**, Wicket Events in **Italy** and Tectix in **Germany**) and you‚Äôll understand that we‚Äôll be seeing millions of tickets processed by the GET protocol.

I‚Äôm willing to bet that we‚Äôll see at least 5 million tickets in 2022:

&gt;*5 million \* 0,28 \* 0,7 = ‚Ç¨980.000 in buybacks or around 1,2 million $*

You can imagine what **buybacks of 100k $ each month** will do to such a smallcap, especialy considering that all this bought GET is **burned after usage**.

If the price would remain stable we‚Äôd see 5 million GET burned, or 25% of the entire supply (SF of 13 million will be burned soon anyway as it isn‚Äôt used so I don‚Äôt consider that as supply).

Of course the price will not remain stable as with such an increase in buybacks &amp; burns, GET will be recognised as **truely deflationary through real world usage**.

# NFT tickets that will revolutionise ticketing

As of this month all tickets issued by the GET protocol will become NFT‚Äôs

Over **120.000** sold tickets (that haven‚Äôt ben scanned yet for the event) are being minted as **NFT‚Äôs** right now. This means that tickets, after scanning can become **collectables**. But so much more:

**Here's my take on why GET protocol's smart and blockchain registered tickets becoming NFT's will revolutionize the ticketing industry.**

After the DeFi hype we‚Äôve witnessed last year, the next hype in crypto that seems to be developing are **NFT‚Äôs**. In this case it isn‚Äôt about riding the hype. Tickets being NFT‚Äôs on the blockchain really **makes sense** and it will **change ticketing** as we know it. Let me explain‚Ä¶

So what‚Äôs a NFT exactly? NFT stands for **non fungible token**. This is a token that‚Äôs **unique** on the blockchain and **not mutually interchangeable**. This in contrast to for example Bitcoin where it doesn‚Äôt matter which Bitcoin you have (1 BTC = 1 BTC). **Every ticket** issued by the GET protocol will become a **getNFT**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hh52y2bx8tk61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a779fd65d457911d56da65d837e632ddaef6855

**getNFTs** are **indivisible**, meaning that a getNFT can only be held by 1 address at the same time. This ensures that whoever owns a certain NFT will be the **only one** to decrypt the QR code.

Eventhough GET‚Äôs NFT‚Äôs will be the **most used, bought &amp; traded** NFT‚Äôs in the **crypto space** the goal isn‚Äôt to ride the hype. **Ticketing + NFT = a match made in heaven**. And here‚Äôs why:

As every ticket on the blockchain will become a NFT and thus unqiue, it will allow **non custodial ownership of the ticket asset**. This gives many interesting **advantages** but 2 stand out for me personally: **P2P ticket trading &amp; DeFi event financing**.

**P2P ticket trading**NFT‚Äôs will allow P2P ticket trading and GET‚Äôs almost done building it! Peer to peer ticket trading means that everyone who owns a getNFT ticket will be able to trade it with another ‚Äúpeer‚Äù. This will happen in a **closed** and **regulated ecosystem**. This means that certain **rules** can be set by the event organizer. For example:

* The ticket can be sold for only x% profit
* x% of the trade profit goes to the event organizer
* a certain trading fee goes to the event organizer
* ‚Ä¶

This will be the **first** and **only** ticketing system that will allow ticket trading while at the same time making **scalping impossible**. Regulators have been struggling for a long time to solve this problem and what seemed impossible to achieve will be made possible by **smart contracts**! The **impact** of this will be **huge** and will **change the ticketing space** for the better.Additionally and not unimportantly it will give the event organizer an **extra revenue stream**. The money that right now for a large part goes to scalpers (the secondary ticket market is worth $15B) will be **tapped into by the event organizers.**

[Why this is important](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/scalping)

The advantage for GET holders is twofold:

1. The P2P market will atract **more users** (artists, venues, ticketing companies) of the GET protocol (= more GET needed in the primary market)
2. every ticket exchanged in the secondary market is an **additional statechange** (= more GET needed)

**Event financing**Without a doubt one of the most promising and exciting things to look forward to in 2021 is the introduction of **decentralized event financing** to GET Protocol.Event organizers often struggle to get **financing** for their events. This doesn‚Äôt only apply to starting artists, but even to famous stars. The artists need to have a lot of **capital in advance** as they have to pay for the venues, organisation, ‚Ä¶ **upfront** while only receiving the money **after the show is over**. Enter GET‚Äôs DeFi solution!

&gt;*The pre-financing of events for event-organizers is not a solution looking for a problem; it‚Äôs a widely known and used tool that enables event organizers to make the investments needed to get their shows or festivals off the ground.In the past we have encountered Event Organizers who select their ticketing partner solely based on the amount of money and loan conditions that they are offered up front.*

Thanks to getNFT tickets you‚Äôll be able to **pre-finance** events of **your choice**. You can **choose** to finance new artists (more risk/more APY) or established kpop stars (less risk/less APY).

This is how it will work:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g27om10y8tk61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aea0bbaa4efba122af54764d7180c2cceca89a5

*If the concept seems complicated, here‚Äôs what you need to understand about GET‚Äôs decentralized financing solution:1.) Event organizers will be able to easily pre-finance their events. (Something they desperately crave.)2.) Investors will be able to invest in events of their choice, at a risk &amp; reward level that they feel comfortable with.3.) The $GET token is an integral part of the financing process, as it is required for ‚Äòskin in the game‚Äô from*

The **advantage** event financing for GET token holders will bring is again twofold:

1. As a GET holder you‚Äôll be able to finance events and **share in the profit of the ticket sales**. This means that GET will allow you to profit without selling = **passive income**. An important note is that this is profit **without inflation**. While other DeFi projects give you returns by increasing the supply (and thus decreasing the value of the token) the returns here will not increase the GET supply, as the returns **come from real profit**(ticket sales).
2. As the GET token will be an **integral** part of this process, it will:- increase the **buy pressure** of the GET token (everyone who wants to participate will need GET)- **decrease** the **supply** (everyone who participates will have to locks his GET tokens).

For a deeper insight I recommend the blog below:

# GET protocol will be decentralised

The endgoal of the GET protocol is to become **open source** and **decentralised**. There will be a **governance model** where changes to the protocol will be determined by **GET token holders**. That‚Äôs why I expect ticketing companies to acquire a lot of GET in time as their revenue relies on the direction of the protocol.

If your monthly trading volume is below 100k, your costs are going way up for the second time this year.

Where they used to have one &lt; 100k tier at 0.25% taker and 0.15% maker, they split that in to three brackets.

**&lt; 10k:** Both taker and maker are half a percent. Meaning a round-trip is now a full percent.

**10-50k:** Both taker and maker are 0.35%.

**50-100k:** These are the older rates of 0.25% taker and 0.15% maker.

Institutional folks see lower prices for all tiers above 100MM.
