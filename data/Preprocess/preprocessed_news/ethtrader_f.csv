Seems like anyone can create a newsletter on substack and shill it everywhere.. Hi everyone, new to the board/Reddit in general. I apologize if this is a common question, but I'm curious how others have been purchasing ether in preparation for the next run. I've slowly accumulated eth coins over the past year while I learned about the technology but the overall investment was small. In anticipation of the next run seemingly coming in the very near future I'm admittedly feeling a bit of FOMO in wanting to go in on ethereum in a bigger way. I tried to pull some equity out of an investment property but the banks don't like doing that when the investment is a condo. Should I just keep going with the slow and steady approach? Personal loans just feel too expensive for the risk involved versus the HELOC I was trying to get with interest only payments. Appreciate any thoughts or ideas that others have been utilizing..

They’re US-based, backed by some very big firms, and regulated, so no, they are not a scam from everything I’ve seen.. I've had a solid experience with blockfi so far and it's definitely not a scam. They are regulated in the states holding lending licenses in 47 states and operate above board under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. If you look at what banks do with our money, that's what they are doing with our crypto. That being said, they have admitted interest rates are currently subsidized by their investment capital (Fidelity, Morgan Creek, Galaxy Digital, etc) so these high rates won't last forever. 

I've actually voiced concerns in the past with them regarding their product features (high withdrawal fees, minimum balance requirements to earn interest etc) and zac prince (blockfi ceo) and blockfi have both reached out and have managed to make vast improvements to their product in a short amount of time which I've been impressed with. 

They still do change their interest rate fairly regularly depending on the market demand which I initially expected blockfi would manage to avoid, but keeping those things in mind, it's a great option in the lending space. They also have compounding interest which is a leg up from Celsius which only offers simple interest earning to their clients.

* People that have become inactive in the community make it more difficult to reach minimum governance thresholds, due to the initial donut distribution and the amount those people hold.
* The barrier is so high in the current scheme for new members to have a vote in this community. It could take years to build up a donut count, online forum communities shouldn't have such a huge barrier.

This also creates a precedent for increasing the donut distribution, which could be useful once we get past week 100 (i.e. it might make sense at that time to increase the distribution again)..

> https://zoom.us/meeting/register/ac0891d4982f22e866858a512be5123a

Info about the contest: 

> # What We’re Looking For
> Participants are encouraged to follow the ideas they feel most passionate about. They should also keep in mind that there is an additional positive impact award for a project that best addresses a social / community issue. There will also be bounties up for grabs from data providers and sponsors.
> 
> **1. Create a State Change Using a Chainlink Oracle**
>
> * All submissions must demonstrate how a smart contract can use Chainlink oracles to fetch data off-chain and use this said data to trigger an on-chain state change.
* For example, you can use market data to trigger a derivatives contract, retrieve IoT sensor data to determine an insurance payout, extract gaming results via a web API to reward winners of online competitions or more. Given the massive pool of valuable data that exists off-chain, there are boundless ways to leverage it in unique and pragmatic smart contract designs, so get creative!
> 
> **2. Data Aggregation**
>
> * Another area we’re particularly interested in is how projects aggregate off-chain data into a single input to trigger their on-chain contract.
> * Since Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network, developers are able to obtain multiple data feeds and then aggregate them together into a single data point by using a median, weighted average, removing outliers, etc.
> * We’re very curious to observe how developers take advantage of Chainlink’s decentralization to create reliable and trusted data through various aggregation strategies.
> 
> **3. Original Code and Practical Business Models**
> 
> * We are looking for projects with original source code (written during the event only) and have practical business models that can be easily applied in the real world.
> * While experimental concepts are great to push the space forward, we’re interested in smart contracts that can be implemented today and meet actual adoption. We will take into consideration areas like game theory, industry fit, and potential consumer demand when judging a project’s viability in the real world
> 
> #Prizes
> *Over $60K worth of bounties are available for the winners.* 
> 
> **Chainlink Bounties**
> 
> * 1st Place — $15,000
> * 2nd Place — $8,000
> * 3rd Place — $5,000
> * Positive Impact — $2,000
> * 6 Judge’s Choices — $1,000 each
> * *All bounties paid in LINK tokens*

> * 1st Place — 1 Year Professional API Amberdata subscription (10k value) and 100 DAI
> * 2nd Place — 1 Year Professional API Amberdata subscription (10k worth) and 50 DAI

EOS,"SOS Daily Discussion - October 18, 2019. I've been thinking lately about what a community is. I've come to realize that a smaller community is not of necessity a lesser community. A community is a plurality of people who aid each other in the pursuit of some common goal. Whether it's the people of a village aiding each other in living by the sharing of labor and goods, a family trying to love each other and make the other members smile, the employees and executives of a company co-operating to generate capital, or the fan club of this or that band enjoying the artists' work together,  all of these are communities because the members are united in their goals. The strength or quality of a community is dependent on that unity alone; with it, the community thrives, and the moment the community has entirely lost it is the moment the community is dead. A higher number of members doesn't mean more unity or less, though it could be argued that larger communities tend to be looser (like the community of a village versus that of a city, or the community of an immediate family versus that of an extended family).

If there was enough discord on this subreddit to spark a schism, then that schism probably needed to happen so that the remaining members and the members of the new community could pursue their separate goals separately. Personally, I don't agree with the reasoning behind leaving, but this community isn't really worse off for losing them. Yes, less content, fewer votes,  less participation.  But in the end, we can still function as a community for as long as there are just a few people with memes to share, ideas to state, and donuts to experiment with. As long as there's a goal of discussing Ethereum, and an ""us"" to pursue that goal, the community goes on.

I don’t know how futures on bitcoin could impact the trading price on let’s say, Binance or Coinbase.  The spot price of Bitcoin isn’t dictated by the futures price, it’s dictated by the last trade.  The only way it could impact the price is if a bearish position resulted in some entity dumping Bitcoin on the open market.  The reason why futures controls commodities like gold & silver is because spot buys are determined by looking at the futures price.  No one looks at the futures price for Bitcoin.  Am I wrong to look at it like this?. Futures were available on exchanges like bitmex so I’m not really sure how true that was that they colluded to cause the market crash.

This is [Mihai](https://twitter.com/mihaialisie), one of the Ethereum co-founders and the founder of [AKASHA](https://akasha.org/)! 

For those preferring a quick TL;DR, here is an attempt (although I recommend reading the blogpost if you find any of the points below interesting):

* Meetup.com is the home of over 1 million Ethereans and recently it surprised many people with an overnight pricing change later named a “test”
* The total value extracted from the Ethereum community alone in this new pricing model would touch **±$3 million USD** yearly
* Since Meetup.com was bought by WeWork and WeWork is going through some really hard times now, the future of the Ethereum meetup community is uncertain
* Ethereum is a unique mix of financial, technological and social capital.
* It seems like there might be a correlation between these 3 forms of capital.
* An Ethereum meetup exodus would bring with it community fragmentation and a big blow to Ethereum's current social capital.
* We can do something about this together and maybe trigger in the process a “social capital flippening” resulting in Ethereum becoming the #1 blockchain community in the world.
* The Ethereum community is at a point where it can take control of its destiny by leveraging its existent technological and financial capital to increase its social capital
* Since it appears that there is some correlation between the 3 forms of capital, an increase in social capital could lead also to increased financial and technological capital

[At DEVCON 5 we presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaMXa6R-jyI) what is possible with what has become known as “AKASHA Reloaded” - a social media framework enabling the creation of interoperable social media networks enhanced by blockchain technology. Ethereum.World is the first social network that will use the AKASHA world framework and we invite everyone to join the fun by [proposing integrations](https://ethereum.world/propose-integration), [suggesting features](https://ethereum.world/suggest-feature) and [requesting languages](https://ethereum.world/request-language).

In the meantime, I thought it’s important to highlight this problem in the Ethereum community so at least the community is aware of it - after all the first step towards solving any problem is to become aware of it.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas on how we can/should approach this problem as an intelligent collective of individuals passionate about “decentralization”, “blockchain” and “DeFi”!.

If it manages to dominate in at least in the scalable smart contract platform and doesn't lose its edge in research and usability to competitors it will be highly successful and probably used by millions.. I view the obstacles you highlight as mere challenges and opportunities.

My take: it doesn't make it unforkable, it just means it is highly non-trivial.  In interpreted languages like Python, you have the option to copy data structures, like lists and dictionaries.  Easy.  But what if the list contains a dictionary?  So you can do that too, but then we call it a deep-copy, because that isn't always what you want to do.

So it doesn't make Ethereum unforkable, but that any fork has to be prepared to go all-in and perform the deep-copy.

Ideally, future forks are made for real reasons.  Immutability is still controversial, for instance.  VB is running polls testing to see how deep public support is one way or the other.

For anyone who missed it, Szabo did an interview and it's a good one:

https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/nick-szabo-on-cypherpunks-money-and-bitcoin

He doesn't like what's going on in Ethereum re: governance.  He's obviously a super-smart guy so I want to try to understand his reasoning, but I keep coming up short.

Ethereum is still in flux.  It is famously still under construction.  I fail to see how governance at this stage in the game is relevant to its future success.  You're writing a program and you're going to put the feature set up for a vote while it's still in progress?  That's madness!

Will there come a time when it matures, the feature set is stable, and questions arise as to how various processes are to be performed?  Of course.

But why isn't the hard fork a remedy to the creators acting in bad faith?  Just for the moment, disregard the complications DeFi brings to the table, those are really secondary to the issue anyways.  If the threat of the hard fork is always there, that compels the Foundation to act in their best interests, which should be synonymous with the best interests of the hodlers, at least if you take the long view.  They want the coin to succeed just as much as anyone if not more.

Eventually of course they will fail at this (I expect when the cowboys move on and the farmers move in) and then comes the hard fork.  Painful, confusing, inconvenient: yes.  But cataclysmic?  You get to start fresh with an excellent code base and tweak the ruleset.  How is this a bad thing?  How is this any different than the natural order of things which is that you need to destroy before you can create?

This sounds like incompetence to me, the reality is at some point you can paint arguments for and against, or you can just say legislation is outdated. However to sit on the fence or make successive U-turns, or fail to provide clarity is incompetent. Assuming ETH 2.0 remains decentralised, which it will if it is to launch successfully, then the arguments remain the same as ETH 1.0.. That's pretty stupid. Validators do work, it's not a passive investment. And this work is validating transactions honestly and assembling blocks.

Moreover, a lot of professional staking operators are heavy on ops side. So it's a rather competitive field. It's not ""passive"" by any means!

If CFTC and SEC will continue to create unreasonable regulations in the US, the US will certainly lose its leadership in technologies and will not own the future. They work against the US!. Other than just the argument that staking isn’t a passive investment and requires work (node uptime and maintenance, computation) the argument of a common enterprise and less decentralization in PoS vs PoW is wrong. There is still no common enterprise just as there isn’t in PoW. Furthermore if they understood Eth 2.0 they would understand there will be more decentralization with a decrease in node requirements, greater profitability in running a solo node rather than pooling, the advent of decentralized staking pools that spread out staked ETH across many validators (such as rocket pool), and the removal of ASICs and economies of scale that inevitably come with PoW.

&#x200B;

There is a small service we created to gift ethereum to anyone you find worthy such a precious gift. Main focus is towards users who do not have Ethereum yet. That is why we hedge Ether to DAI to make it clear to end user, how much Ethereum worth in USD they will receive at any point in time. When they activate a card, they will be instructed how to some popular wallet providers. And finally, they can activate card, and redeem Ether, even with 0 balance on account (because their transaction is funded by gifter).

&#x200B;

There are a lot of ways to improve the website, but in order to not keep it a long hanging never released project, we decided to limit ourselves to very basic functionality, and ask crypto-people, if they would use it to onboard their friends into Ethereum.

All comments would be much appreciated!

Money being used by criminals doesn't mean that there is something wrong with the money.

If a money actually works, then it can be used by anyone. It's not supposed to be a surveillance device for the patrons of these two shills. It's supposed to be a medium of exchange. Criminals have to be found, prosecuted and foiled through means other than warrantless mass-surveillance and centralized permissioning of people's private financial interactions.

People like these two consultants, and the CNN editors who choose to give them a podium, are giving governments like China's the tools to institute absolute repression.

Every new technology enables new types for crime, just as it opens up new opportunities. The automobile facilitates bank heists. The internet created entire categories of internet crime. Electronic cash creates crimes that are only possible with electronic cash. That doesn't mean you get rid of the technology, or stifle what makes them valuable.

Internet crime doesn't justify prohibiting the public key cryptography that enables secure peer-to-peer transmission of data. Cryptocurrency crime doesn't justify eliminating the immutability and decentralization that gives cryptocurrency its apolitical frictionless-ness.

Instead of trying to stop cryptocurrency crime by stifling cryptocurrency, law enforcement agencies should be looking to utilize the new opportunities that this new technology gives them. 

For example, informants can be remotely and anonymously compensated for information leading to the dismantling of criminal networks. This is a tactic that relies on the very same properties that enable cryptocurrency to be used for crime. National security and law enforcement agencies need to adapt to the new technology, not just call for crude and sweeping measures that tries to turn back the clock on technological and social evolution, and do an enormous amount of collateral damage to personal liberty and economic opportunity in the process.

EOS","SOS [Article] - Anticipating Ethereum 2 in 2020. >The design of phase 2 is far less complex than that of phases 0 and 1: it simply defines the idea of an *execution environment*. An execution environment is an engine of Ethereum 2 that carries out the work of processing transactions.  However, phase 2 by itself does not define any particular execution  environment and so, in conjunction with phase 2 being released, there  are expected to be a number of execution environments built by the  Ethereum teams as well as third parties. These fall into two categories: general-purpose execution environments and function-specific.

This is incorrect. As of today, the main focus of research is happening in phase 2 because it's the most complex phase of the three. It not only defines what an execution environment is but it also needs to create an eWASM spec and cross-shard communication spec, stateless clients, among many other hard topics that still remain unsolved. In addition to that, it remains the question of HOW ETH 1 will be migrated to ETH 2 as an execution environment. That's why, even by the most optimistic predictions a usable version of ETH 2 still remains at least two years away,

The community should check [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/e9moc2/current_state_of_eth_20/fals1gl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) as well as the discussion and information on Ethhub, Cat herders, eth magicians and ethresearch to see with their own eyes the many requirements still needed for ETH 2 to take place in the near future.. .

there was another address (f31) already selling before that guy (d13), and was cashing out in 1000 SNX lots on uniswap.

the interesting thing about synthetix being so deeply defi is that moves are so transparent because everything is on-chain. once f31 started to buy sUSD in preparation to burn off his debt and unlock his stake, i think everyone else who was also watching knew what was going to go down. after f31 broke through 0.007 ETH, i think this caused d13 to panic, seeing that there was someone else of similar size that would be competing with him for exit liquidity. 

i agree with u/SpacePirateM, this seems nothing more than just 2 accounts that are were around the #100 ranking in top holders that decided to exit at the same time, into a thin market, and this spooked some other smaller players that also contributed to the sell-off, but did not have that much size.

d13 balance has trace amounts of SNX left, but he actually still has more than 50,000 SNX which are locked up for a year from claiming as rewards, which he is using to continue to stake and mint.

afaik, nothing has changed regarding the fundamentals of the project, and they should be releasing their 2020 roadmap plan and scheduling the next governance call soon.. People sold..

It's the biggest platform for tokens of all types, defi leverages this, it can't just start to exist by itself.  
More generally, tokens and smart contracts that can manipulate them.  
There's also the dns system growing - ENS.  

>Ethereum failed to embrace IBC and achieve real decentralization  
>Ethereum is creating a single point of failure by trying to implement sharding to create a single blockchain instead of creating many small and independent chains.

Those are advantages. It's not decentralization when everything is on its own network controlled by the devs. More importantly there's no reason to use the ""main"" blockchain in this scenario, which makes the native token worthless.

>Ethereum keeps delaying its roadmap.

This is true, but so far there's no real danger from any competition.

>Ethereum is inflating at 1B US dollar per year

It's about $750M, but nobody disputes the fact that PoW has to go, so you're just repeating the delay point.. Great user name for that statement.. Even with all that said, Investing in ETH is exponentially less risky than most other crypto assets (except bitcoin)

Just last night I found out that Trezor has no security certifications and that Ledger has multiple with one from the cybersecurity branch of France...
Yeah, probably going to dump my trezor.. I’m an Electrical Engineer and the last commercial product I created was based on the STM32405.  That’s a slight variation of the MCUs used in Trezors, but as far as the hack is concerned they’re identical.

It’s incredibly well-documented right in the data sheet that these MCUs are not considered secure given physical access.  I can’t believe this is the platform Trevor uses.  I’m absolutely dumbfounded.

I researched the security of my code on the STM32 product line when when selecting the device with the simple concern over Chinese reverse engineering.  It was easy to determine that if someone really wanted to dump the code and any of our non-volatile stored data including encryption keys, they could, but it wasn’t worth the extra expense to be more secure.  After all, our product was just a really high-end LED controller.

Think of the option bytes security described in this hack as the virtual equivalent of a decent padlock, but no better.  If our product had been a security device intended to literally store an infinite amount of wealth, there’s no way we would have chosen these MCUs.  I now personally have **ZERO** faith in Trezor engineering.  That’s insane.

Edit: This means that the entire code and encryption keys have been dumped, which was then brute forced to render the protection of the contents of that physical wallet in any hands.  **Worse yet**, this means that any decent assembly coder could now modify the code to create predictable seeds, create clones with the modified code, and sell them to people.  They then sit back and wait for their customers to transfer coins to the wallet with keys known to the clone manufacturer and bam, funds are stolen.

**Any Trezor one might buy from this point on runs the risk of running perfectly compatible and indistinguishable, yet modified code to create known keys, rendering any coins stored on the wallet accessible by those that created the counterfeit Trezors**

They should add fiat deposits that convert to chp on the app. the only thing stopping me from playing is having to buy eth from coinbase, transferring it to metamask and then using MEW to send the eth to coinpoker.

EOS,"SOS Do we know how Proof of stake rewards will be treated from a tax perspective? Ordinary income like POW or Capital Gain like a stock dividend?. [removed]. I'm not a CPA but it makes sense to me to call it regular income. It's compensation for the work you do as a validator. You should also be able to deduct your validator hardware or virtual machines as a business expense.. Ordinary income for now, but it could unfold differently.  It would be non-sensical to think of it like a dividend since it is still payment for service done (you aren't just passively taking income even though you have a staked amount, you still do something to get the reward.  The staking will be seen more like a 'buy in' , partly because if you have ETH and don't do the work of validating you don't get the reward, so the ""work"" is what defines the difference in value of eth that is staked and eth that is not.  you're getting paid to validate.

Perhaps importantly, dividends are never taxed as capital gains, but they are taxed at the \_capital gains RATE\_ if they are qualified dividends.  Technically speaking they are taxed \_as dividends\_, either qualified or unqualified and then the IRS has simplified to then have the rates for dividend taxing be either ordinary income levels or capital gains levels.  So...the IRS doesn't think of dividends as a capital gain exactly, it thinks of it as a dividend and then maps to rates of capital gains.

This is just the third cross into positive territory in Ethereum's five-year publicly traded history. In the previous crosses above 0%, ETH's price ascended notably once average holders were in this profitable territory.

If the ratio is above 0%, then on average. Ethereum holders will profit if they sell their coins now. If it is below 0%, then the average holder will realize a loss if they sell.

Banks don't accept businesses they don't like even if it's legal do so. Two simple examples: Marijuana companies and internet porn (production, distribution and participation). Countless banks don't do business with people involved in said business.

For the same reason cryptocurrency banking is not gonna change significantly because certain new AML tweaks are there. The new AML directives have done more harm than good to many companies who have opted to close business or to relocate where better regulation is applied and international cryptocurrency companies are forced out of service in certain countries.

The first part is really easy, but the latter isn't.

The problem with profitting from long time scams is guessing for how long they're going to run. Betting on the greed of the scammer works in your favour when there's some forms of success-announcements giving you updates about the scam's state. ""Milestones"" help.

EOS,"SOS For people with &lt;1000$ funds to invest, is high value coins like bitcoin a good investment or are lower priced Altcoins like eth better?. Price volatility depends on liquidity. Even eth is low in liquidity. So called altseason happens in bull market because there are less sellers so the price rises easier.

Low liquidity is not good for healthy grow. It is possible to margin trade bitcoin in perpetual eth contracts. Bitcoin price is far more stable than of any other coin.

If you wish to buy altcoins you have to guess which ones. You might be wrong, or twice be wrong with altcoins. If you buy more than 2-3 altcoins you can end up minimizing risk with this kind of portfolio but the reward also is minimized.

That is my opinion that far safer to get leveraged on bitcoin than to buy any other crypto. Reffering to.... big money ain't gonna buy some xrp or trx. Even eth is not limited in supply and is inflationary instead of bitcoin.

P.S. I consider 3x is pretty safe leverage if you got good entry price. Also you can add some $$$ to existing position to minimize risk or borrow more if you feel confident about risk. But 2x is for beginners, also you need to buy at correction not at top.. You dont get it at all. You have to look at their market cap circulating supply and current price. For example bitcoin supply is 21M, ethereum 109M and ripple 40B. For ripple to rise in price 1 dollar it s 1000+ times more expensive. 

Also you have to understand the projects. Bitcoin is trying to decentralize currency but ethereum is trying to build things. It s a whole different concept. 

So like any investment you need to learn what you are investing into and not just dump money into a crypto coin without any idea what you getting into.. Just don't even get started EOS"

Ethereum's Daily Active Addresseses have been ascending quite rapidly since Black Thursday, and this is another great sign that ETH is setting itself up for recovery. DAA reveals the number of unique network addresses involved in transactions on a given day.

Simply put, this vital metric indicates the daily level of crowd interaction (or speculation) with a certain token. As we can see, there has been an impressive rise over the past week and a half with a large increase in transactions taking place on the ETH network, and daily active addresses skyrocketed to approximately 395,000 DAA on Saturday, March 21st. This was a 9-month high, with a daily level last exceeding this mark in late June, 2019 (when prices reached an annual high of around $336. ETH’s DAA mostly hovered around 250,000 per day in recent weeks before Black Thursday, so approaching 400,000 is a promising development for Ethereum's mid/ long-term prospects.

Until then, every four years, the inflation rate of bitcoin is halved.

For Ethereum, the inflatin rate isn't capped at all, bu the inflation rate varies depending on the amount that is staked in the whole network. It can be 5%, it can be 0.5%.

Throw in EIP1559 and it might in fact be deflationary and have a negative inflation rate.. Ethereum doesn't have a fixed maximum number like Bitcoin. As it currently stands, Ethereum has a \~4% annual inflation rate.

EOS,"SOS Hex Banner Needs to be Removed ASAP. Richard Heart's HEX is either a brilliantly designed scam, or else a catastrophically ill-designed service. Either way, no honest person should trust their money to that system. 

Let me say to begin with that my area of knowledge in cryptoeconomics is far more on the economics side than the crypto. I can't read Solidity, I don't know a merkledag from a zk-SNARK, and so I have to trust that what HEX claims to be in their contracts is in fact in their contracts. If what they claim is actually false, then Q.E.D.: they're either lying or ignorant about what it is they're doing. If their claims are true, then HEX is almost certainly one of the most robust private exit-scams ever seen.

From the outset, HEX claims to be a CD, or certificate of deposit. So far so good: CD's are traditional financial instruments that have been around for quite some time. They work similarly to typical bank deposits, with the bank lending out the deposited money to return interest to the depositor, except with a CD the depositor is not free to withdraw their money until a fixed term has been completed, say a year. This assures the bank that there's no risk of the money being withdrawn at any moment, and so the bank will lend it out more freely. At the end of the year, the depositor gets his deposit back, plus interest which is higher than the interest he would have been paid had he just deposited the money regularly. In short, a CD is an agreement to lock up your funds in exchange for interest: interest earned by lending out your funds. HEX is not a CD, as it lacks one of those key components. HEX provides users with the option to lock up their HEX tokens (in fact it obliges some of them to do so in the beginning), but what they get in exchange is not interest. It is a percentage increase on their total number of HEX tokens, but that increase isn't provided by lending out the tokens, it's provided through inflation. You see, HEX has a set inflation rate of 3.69% yearly. A user who locks up their tokens in this contract will get a share of that stream of new tokens based on how much they lock up for how long. This difference may seem unimportant, but it's actually what makes HEX suspicious in the first place. Lending is a legitimate service; it provides liquidity that borrowers pay for it because it's valuable to them. It's clear where the value comes from in a CD. HEX is not a legitimate service; all it provides is more HEX. Rather than having a clear source of value, it has a hidden lack of a source of value.

Anybody's hackles should now be raised: this inflationary trick is essentially the same as swapping someone's dime for two nickles and telling them you've doubled their money. HEX's dishonesty is not limited to that, however. Currently, the system is in its “launch phase” and it has a convoluted system of incentives, bonuses and penalties in effect that hide a good deal more. Holders of Bitcoin on the date of HEX's launch have the option to prove their ownership of Bitcoin to receive free HEX tokens. The tokens that are left unclaimed are gradually sent to a contract where they are exchanged for Ether. The Ether accumulated in this way is controlled by HEX's admin, i. e. Richard Heart. Of course, the process is not described this way: rather, the gradual sending of unclaimed HEX is called a “late penalty”, exchanging them is called “transforming”, and the address which holds the Ether is called an “adoption amplifier”. These and other poetic terms hide the prosaic fact that unclaimed tokens are given to Richard Heart and he sells them immediately for personal profit. 

Another hidden beauty in HEX is a little number called the “Origin Address”. It has no stated purpose and doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere other than a brief description in an out-of-the way document, but it enjoys some remarkable privileges. Half of all penalties are paid into this address, and a complete copy of all bonus payouts (which, in this system, is a large portion of all payouts). Note that it is not explained where the HEX to cover these “copies” comes from. It could be deducted from inflation, it could be added to inflation, it could be taken from the bonus payouts. Wherever it comes from, it takes value away from HEX holders and places it in this Origin Address. It is difficult because of the obfuscatory bonus and penalty scheme to calculate just how much of the total supply of HEX will go to this address, but based on numbers provided by HEX in the source document, a minimum of 25% seems certain. I have seen it estimated to be 45%, but can't say for certain whether this is true. At any rate, at least a quarter of the total supply of HEX is going to be given to this address. The controller of this address will therefore be a gigantic whale in the HEX economy. This address was created along with all the others in the HEX contracts, and is therefore controlled by HEX admin just like the Adoption Amplifier above. In a nutshell, HEX admin hold an address which will be given no less than a quarter of all HEX. Richard Heart is under no agreement with HEX holders to use his whale abilities for the benefit of the ecosystem; HEX holders are entirely at his mercy.

Even with all this being true, it could still be argued that it can all be attributed to incompetence rather than malice. Perhaps the makers of HEX truly believe that their token can somehow become valuable without receiving that value from elsewhere (in other words, perhaps they believe in alchemy). Perhaps they believe that the HEX economy is better off with a central player controlling it rather than the market controlling it (in other words, perhaps they believe in communism). However this may be, there is one last detail about the Origin Address, and this is what shows almost beyond doubt that HEX was designed, and brilliantly designed, to facilitate an exit scam.

Remember that HEX holders are given incentive to lock their HEX tokens into deposit contracts. The larger and longer their deposit, the greater their promised reward. If they withdraw their deposit before the term is met, they are penalized up to half of their initial deposit. According to HEX, about 26% of all HEX is currently locked in these deposits. Now imagine that a whale were to dump his holdings—26% of the total HEX supply would be unavailable to be sold, thus propping up the price that the whale can sell for. But say that it was such a huge whale dumping his holdings that people chose to get out of their deposits and sell to protect their losses—up to half their deposit would be penalized. Who benefits from this penalty? The depositors who remain on board, and the Origin Address. The Origin Address gets half of every penalty. This means that the holder of the Origin Address can dump his whale holdings, which will be at least 25% of the token supply, and then every depositor in the system is forced to either prop up his sell price by holding on to their deposit, or send him more HEX tokens to use as he sees fit. Richard Heart, as the creator of HEX and controller of the Origin Address, has devised a pump-and-dump exit-scam in which the tokenholders are not only victims of his fraud, but are actually contractually forced through immutable smart contracts to assist in their own defrauding. This may be one of the greatest scams in history.

[Technical Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0ZDaBQx4ghkdX5IUwZb1n8ThvYf7i22MSt9Gm00JRU/edit#) and [HEX mainpage](https://hex.win/). I've voted ""Remove"" because doing my research into Hex last year quite clearly revealed it's an elaborate ploy to force people to trade valuable ETH for a token that Richard Heart can easily PnD.  Scam or Ponzi, definitely.  I think there were some good background discussion threads on r/ethfinance about this back in 2019.

HOWEVER - this raises an interesting question on our philosophy as a subreddit - do we censor scams?  If we do, we clearly are not censorship-resistant.  And - how to we identify/classify scams?  Do we have to research every single banner application? It's a long rabbit hole to go down, and we'll end up at some sort of centralization.

Is there alternative path , say a community fund to buy out the banners when we agree that the current banner is not in agreement with community interests as a whole?  If we as a community buy back the banner, we would not be resorting to a centralized method to ""censor"".. Promoting hex = promoting scam.

(you won't pay 15% of 10k, just the amount you profited on. ie. bought at 9k, sold at 10k in less than 1 year, owe 20% of 1k profit. $200 in Capital gains taxes). Funny question for someone who doesn't have over 10k to withdraw lol. The easiest answer is  withdraw X amount under 10k and then wait until the next Jan 1st to withdraw another <10k.

You answered your own question, you can't hide income from the IRS.

EOS,"SOS Ethereum has More Bitcoin Locked up Through wBTC Compared to Bitcoinâ€™s LN. This is good for Bitcoin.. Cool! One step closer to interoperability and mutual acceptance of tokens. I don't understand why this post keeps coming up on ethereum subreddits. And I think most folks making the comparison of locking bitcoin in wBTC vs lightning think the two can be compared the same way...

As far as lightning is concerned, it's good that not a whole lot is locked up in channels. You're not exactly supposed to lock up large amounts of bitcoin to fund your channels. Only what you're willing to spend. Lightning channels are much more like very risky hot wallets. Most bitcoin folks prefer cold storage for their btc.

wBTC on the other hand is BTC basically held in escrow with a wrapped token representing it so that it's tradable on Ethereum. As long as the mechanism for holding that BTC in escrow is secure, hodling your btc in a smart contract that wraps it and makes it a tradable token on ethereum is a good thing. especially if that smart contract pays out interest/mint/burn/exchange fees to those hodling their btc in it (i.e. imbtc, pbtc, and I think tbtc).

tldr; lightning network was not built to lock up large amounts of token. wbtc perhaps was. So everything is working as intended. Nothing to brag about here. Not worth posting an article about it.

But is it more profitable? Honest question, I am considering the same but it seems to me that it is more profitable to run trades in a centralized exchange.

I ran some calculations: I trade using binance, the trading fee is .075% (using bnb). So if I decide to sell one eth for tether I pays as much as maybe 0.2 tether in fees with current price. I don't pay any network transaction fee since this is not a transaction in the blockchain.

Now if I use an on chain exchange like [https://1inch.exchange/#/](https://1inch.exchange/#/), I avoid exchange fee but now I have to pay gas for the blockchain transaction, which is higher than what I pay in binance for fees.

I mean since this is about trading and making money, how is moving away from a centralized exchange better?. I would use Uniswap for a first time experience.  Doesn't get much easier than that.  

  

If you're looking for some more features, I remember liking IDEX, but it's been awhile.. Depends on what you want to trade.

For ETHDAIUSDC pairs DYDX limit orders have 0 fees (so far).   You also have access to leverage but those all come with fees.   Deposit/withdrawal ofc will have on-chain fees.

I know of no other place that one doesn't either have on-chain fees or some other fee associated with trading.

What I find interesting is that most if not all of the stock market brokerage houses are removing fees to encourage trading all the while the cryptoworld is jacking fees up. EOS"

Cryptocurrency DeFi interest rates only look scammy because the “real” world interest rates should be priced for higher default rates than current.. Well it's true, this essentially is a short term arbitrage opportunity.  

As the arbitrage decreases, the TVL of funds in compound should increase, which does mean that some of these coins will have significant ammounts of their supply locked up as collateral in these platforms.

As someone that's been in the space 8 years now & spent a lot of time on reddit in the early days, I know how tribal the space can be.

Tomorrow I'll be talking about why competition is necessary, why protocols are better off trying to get along, why BTC in DeFi is a good thing & how to keep up with all the innovation in the space.

30/6/2020,"SOS AMA with the 0x team on the launch of Matcha | July 1, 2020 at 11am PT. Congrats, great stuff, have been playing with the beta for a week or two, it's very smooth and the UI is beautiful. Can you tell us some things about the user research process, what type of methods did you use, and some key insights which helped to build matcha?. 1) Are there plans to integrate a portal to be able to add liquidity to Matcha indirectly via Uniswap, Kyber, or Balancer?

2) Is 0x Labs planning to decentralize the token listing process? 

3) Will there be a staking portal for ZRX and other tokens on Matcha? In the case of ZRX to create a feedback loop for users' to earn and trade similar to Compounds lending and borrowing?

4) Are there plans to create trading competitions with prizes or loyalty points?  

5) Are there plans for a mobile app in the future?

6) How will you onboard new users from CeFi that don't have experience with MetaMask and other DeFi centric wallets?

7) How will ZRX holders benefit from Matcha other than staking?

8) Will Matcha integrate with other DeFi platforms like Compound to provide borrowing and lending capabilities for users. In other words, could Matcha become the one-stop-shop for all your DeFi needs for Trading, borrowing/lending, staking... kinda like how amazon started off as a bookstore and now its hands are in everything from Hollywood to live streaming? Or will Matcha take the approach of integrating into other apps like Argent similar to kyberswap?

9) A more general question, is 0x Labs planning to test on Kusama, Pokadot's test chain? The reason why I ask this is because I see Multichain dapps similar to what Polkadot/Kusama is doing as the best solution for Ethereum's scaling problem. In other words, will the 0x ecosystem be blockchain agnostic?

10) Are there plans to bring more utility to ZRX tokens in the Matcha exchange like zero-fee (0x hint 0exchange) trading or cashback for farming?

11) I think Matcha needs something other than UI/UX to differentiate itself from other Dexes and DeFi products in general. Something unique like the ability to trade NFTs. We saw how powerful these slight advantages can be with the advent of Balancer's ability to be able to not only provide liquidity but also keep a balanced portfolio..

At Kraken, we’re always striving to keep clients on top of what’s happening in the fast-moving cryptocurrency sector.

One of the biggest trends this year is the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement, an emerging class of cryptocurrency projects that use blockchains to offer lending and market making services operating without financial intermediaries.

These services have seen staggering growth overing the last 12 months, growing 400% to hold over $2 billion in value, according to DeFi Pulse.

With that in mind, we’re excited to announce listing of three crypto assets powering these new protocols:

* [Compound (COMP)](https://compound.finance/)
* [Kava (KAVA)](https://www.kava.io/)
* [Kyber Network (KNC)](https://kyber.network/)

Additionally, we will be listing [Storj (STORJ)](https://storj.io/), a crypto asset that operates a blockchain data storage solution.

I think the best path for someone to overtake ethereum right now is to create a chain which is interoperable with ethereum and makes the user experience feel so smooth that they don't even realise they've left the ETH ecosystem. 

ETH and defi is my only investment in this space at the moment. But, the current gas fees really do open the door for something like this to happen and a new chain to become dominant (NOT SAYING IT WILL HAPPEN). Try doing a trade on uniswap right now, the fees really make it feel not so futuristic.

Im really hoping we get some short term solution which people actually use, right now it's my biggest concern because nobody is using layer 2 solutions outside of testing them out. 

To put it another way, look at what bitcoin fees were like at the end of the 2017 bullrun. ETH fees are already super high and we could be getting an entirely new defi bullrun. I can't even imagine how high fees are going to get if they are this big at the start.. Ethereum can’t support one modestly successful cat game. Don’t kid yourself that some grand ecosystem exists on it now.. I already made that meme 🤨🤨

EOS","SOS Exchanges are offering over $2m in ETH and other cryptos this summer in trading competitions!. I'm cashing in on this. [deleted]. Accounts with barely any history, doesn’t seem like spam at all EOS","SOS Ethereum 2.0 Attacknet Launches. All hackers across the world have just been invited by ethereum developers to bring down the incentivized ethereum 2.0 testnet, the attacknet.

A first of its kind, Danny Ryan, the ethereum 2.0 coordinator, said: “We welcome white hats to bring down the two beta-0 attacknets for reward and fame.”

Haxors get $5,000 to bring down Lighthouse or Prism, both ethereum 2.0 clients in this incentivized testnet, with this being beta for now as:

“Lighthouse-attack-0 and prysm-attack-0 are real networks, ready for you to attack, but they are beta in the sense that it’s our first go at this — we expect to learn and iterate quickly.

These networks are also very small (only 4 nodes each!) so should be pretty easy to take down,” says the github Public Attacknet page.

“These first two attacknets are very small and should be -pretty- easy to take down,” Ryan says, adding:

“In subsequent attacknets, we’ll ramp up sizes, and make more specific (and more difficult) challenges.”

This public testnet run by devs for the purpose of haxors breaking it is meant to operate for about three months, meaning until October, provided everything goes fine.

A public testnet with potentially thousands of nodes is also to be announced with it too to run for three months, with that being effectively the live running of ethereum 2.0 just with fake eth, instead of a bug bounty attractor as is the case for this attacknet.

Danny Ryan previously said they expect to announce the date of the public testnet around now, but the launch of this attacknet is even more encouraging as it suggests they confident enough to put their money where their mouth is by so daring to call on the haxors.

Thus, the genesis block of ethereum 2.0 is now set to launch in November with a reasonable degree of certainty it can meet that deadline provided the testnets run fine. So opening a new page and perhaps a whole new book for ethereum.. >A first of its kind, Danny Ryan, the ethereum 2.0 coordinator, said: “We  welcome white hats to bring down the two beta-0 attacknets for reward  and fame.”

What they are saying is, at this current stage, they are confident someone will break the first test rather easily, they just want to see how you do it.

If Bitcoin is money reimagined, Ethereum offers a fundamental re-evaluation of how various internet platforms and services operate today. Now the second largest cryptocurrency by total value, Ethereum’s existence has been anything but boring. In its five-year history, it has seen the highest of highs during its 2017 bull market as well as lows in 2018 and 2019 that threatened its momentum and adoption. [Learn more about Ethereum.](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-ethereum-eth)

But while much has been written about Ethereum, until now, its story had gone largely undocumented in its entirety.

Fortunately, former Bloomberg Markets reporter and current founder of [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.substack.com/) just published [*The Infinite Machine: How an Army of Crypto-hackers Is Building the Next Internet with Ethereum*](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Machine-Crypto-hackers-Building-Internet-ebook/dp/B07X8HS2WC), a detailed history of Ethereum’s origins, characters and biggest moments. To celebrate its debut, Camila was kind enough to share a few moments with us and detail some of her key learnings from researching her book.

To read the Q&A, navigate to our blog here:[https://blog.kraken.com/post/5781/the-past-and-future-of-ethereum-a-qa-with-infinite-machine-author-cami-russo/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/5781/the-past-and-future-of-ethereum-a-qa-with-infinite-machine-author-cami-russo/)

In MetaMask it is possible to cancel the transaction or re-send it with a higher gas-price, thus reducing the pending time :). https://ethgasstation.info/blog/stuck-transaction-guide/

1. More miners do not equal more transaction throughput. When hashpower of the network goes down, so does the difficulty. The network will try to keep block time at a constant 10-19 seconds. You can check block times here:  [https://etherscan.io/charts](https://etherscan.io/charts)

**Vitalik's response** : Nah don't worry. They will be shooting themselves and their project in the foot doing that.  Since they will end up loosing all those staked coins if they play dirty. They have an incentive to play nice on Eth 2.0.

**Another guy's response:**  As more competition builds up in Defi, more coins will be staked in other projects and over time, it will dampen the effect of too many coins locked into one Defi.. .  EOS","SOS Hurts.. The $430 support level is holding so far which is still bullish. Testing past resistance and turning it into support is very important. It can’t just go straight up.

EOS,"SOS Stupid investing question: Do I take out my gains?. Throwing it away? No. If you leave it, that $3k could grow to a lot more. 

Many folks will encourage you to take some profits when you can which is certainly not a bad idea. It just depends on your long-term goals and why you invested in crypto in the first place. If your goal was to make a quick buck, I would say you have already done that. You could cash out now and be happy that you came out in the green. If your goal is to treat this as a 10-year investment though, I would just ignore any weekly gains and let it ride.

One smart idea would be to try to take profits until you have removed your entire principal (the $ value that you spent on the investment). If you do that, then you have no downside and the emotional factor becomes much easier to bare. Even if this sounds like a good idea to you, I would not sell all at once. Selling slowly by dollar-cost-averaging out is just as important as buying slowly.

The most likely scenario is that Ethereum will become Internet's money, while Bitcoin will serve as a hedge embodying its digital gold value proposition.

Some advice I can give you about giving crypto gifts to non-crypto people, though:

* Make sure they are at least kind of interested in crypto first.  If there isn't at least a spark of interest, the gift will be a dud.  
* Presentation helps.  I usually put the key information on a USB stick and gift that to a person in a nicely wrapped box.  You can also include a joke like ""even if crypto goes to zero, at least you got a USB stick"".  
* Keep a copy of the keys for yourself.  3 out of 5 people I have gifted crypto to lost the USB stick I gave them and/or the account's private key.. As long as he plans to hold, buying now is absolutely fine. In the long term, if ETH hits 10K then buying at 480 vs buying at 450 won’t matter much. That’s still incredible returns EOS"

Investors should choose whatever they think will make them more profit. Right now ETH is very promising. BTC is very close to an all time high right now while ETH is nowhere near that. Also with ETH2.0 right around the corner people are getting excited about it as it moves to a Proof of Stake network. Do some research but ultimately I don’t really think the supply of ETH compared to BTC is really going to make a huge difference. ETH is comparable to a commodity. Like gold or oil, it doesn't have a knowable supply cap. However, like Gold, its supply increase is fairly predictable and regular. Not having a supply cap doesn't make Gold a bad investment, and neither does it with Ether.

I think that Ether is a better investment than Bitcoin because Ethereum is a more robust technology than the Bitcoin blockchain, and this is pretty largely recognized in the blockchain space.

Atomic swap on curve.fi, similar to how RenVM works. No need for a centralized entity.

Just deposit BTC on curve, wait for 6 confirmations, then receive wBTC. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe you may have to convert BTC to Ethereum first and then to WBTC. Im not sure, but there may be a centralized exchange that exchanges BTC and WBTC. You may want to look into renBTC as well. Unfortunately all versions of wrapped Bitcoin are minted by centralized entities. Some are somewhat more decentralized than others. So that's one of the downsides. Really I think that's the only major downside. The only other thing I can think of is just the possibility of bugs or flaws in smart contracts around wrapped versions of BTC.. You can trade BTC for WBTC using any self-custodial swap service, like the [Liquality chrome extension](https://liquality.io/), or any of the instant hosted swap services on [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/ae8ti3/shapeshift_alternatives/) that accept users from your jurisdiction and that list WBTC.

The $ printed was used to buy stocks and the rich enjoyed appreciation of their assets to new heights.. The Fed isn't printing money.  It's buying a lot bonds from banks via QE.  However the proceeds of those purchases remain sitting in an account at the Fed and the banks cannot get at the money directly (though they receive interest).  So the created money is keeping bonds bid (which keeps interest rates low), keeps the government able to sell bonds so they can keep spending, and keeps banks solvent in a low rate environment.  But the money doesn't enter the economy, it just sits in an account at the Fed (and shows up on the M2 chart).  

If the money really was getting into the economy, which would be money printing, we'd be seeing massive inflation in everything not just the stock market.  As it is now, commodities are deflating, not inflating.  Jobs and credit are in decline, which is deflationary not inflationary.

The only thing really going up are speculative assets like equities and crypto because people aren't getting return anywhere else, and because a significant number of people don't know what's going on and think there is money printing.  Government is also spending and giving money to people which is offsetting the deflationary environment caused by shutdowns.  But that can't continue forever.  Eventually there will be a massive deflationary bust.. Some rich people watched their assets tumble, depending on the markets they are in. The ones making the news because they are getting richer are doing so because everyone else is sitting at home buying things from Amazon or speculating in Apple and Tesla stocks.. There is a massive lineup at the food banks yet the yield farmers continue to get richer. The yields was used for ETH buy back and the farmers enjoyed appreciation of their ETH to new heights.  This is because real farmers are chasing real yields and ditching traditional farming, causing real food shortages, hence we need to tap into food banks.

Most of the time, for most transactions on Ethereum, the bulk of the fee is the gas – the network fee paid to Ethereum miners, rather than individual services/platforms, to keep the blockchain going. Gas prices vary widely with network congestion, and smart contract interactions like tokens and DApps take significantly more gas than simple ETH address-to-address transactions. You can read more about gas here: [https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/](https://kb.myetherwallet.com/en/transactions/what-is-gas/)

Gas applies to all participants on Ethereum equally, whether using hardware wallets, mobile wallets, DApps, exchanges, etc... Some centralized services may cover gas for users, but on the other hand they may hold custody over your funds (ie, you never get your keys). On top of gas, there may be fees applied for card purchases of ETH and for swaps by exchanges. You may need to do some research to find how fees differ between services, but again, a lot of the time gas will be the large part of the total fee for Ethereum transactions.

If you'd like to learn more about Ethereum and what kinds of things you can do on it (with DApps, DeFi, domains, staking) - or about MyEtherWallet and its history in the space - take a look at the [Help Page](https://kb.myetherwallet.com), [MEW blog](https://www.mewtopia.com), or [MEW Medium](https://medium.com/myetherwallet).. .

It takes a fresh approach to helping builders and traders accurately estimate gas fees. Specifically, Gas Platform: 

* Estimates prices based on the current contents mempool, rather than the last block. 
* Makes predictions based on block estimates, not time.
* Has an easy to integrate API.
* Provides builders and traders with a rich data payload so you can make your own decisions.
* Is fully documented and actively supported. 

Gas Platform is a significant addition to the ecosystem's gas estimation capabilities. By leveraging the mempool, Gas Platform provides builders and traders with an accurate, up-to-the-moment gas fee API. Our goal is to help you to quickly get on-chain, without overpaying.

EOS","SOS Where to start? Help!. **On Ethereum:**

At its core, Ethereum does basically everything Bitcoin does but with the addition of smart contracts. Smart contracts are little chunks of code that run without any central operator or middleman.

The ELI5 example I like to give is imagine you and I are making a $10 bet on whether the Chiefs are going to win the super bowl this year. In the normal world, we either trust each other to pay up at the end, or we each give our $10 to someone to hold the money and act as an intermediary (and a lot of intermediaries charge fees for this kind of service and make big money). With Ethereum, though, we can actually give our $10 to a smart contract and then the smart contract can automatically pay out the pot to the winner, according to its code.

Smart contracts can essentially remove intermediaries, whether they be in gambling, banking, or anything else. It gets way more intense and complex when you get into the details, but that's the high level picture of why smart contracts are awesome and powerful.

`-----------------------------------`

**On DeFi & dApps:**

&#x200B;

I like to start with Uniswap, which is the biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum. It is a monster, often accounting for 50% of activity on Ethereum and often generating more fees than the entirety of Bitcoin.

Like any exchange, people can exchange one asset for another, and basically any asset running on Ethereum can be found on Uniswap.  (even ethtrader's donuts)

The novel thing about Uniswap is who the trading fees go to.  Think about how trading fees work on something like Coinbase.  You buy ETH, and Coinbase takes a small percentage for themselves.  On Uniswap, there is no middleman... no Coinbase gobbling up all the trading fees.  The trading fees instead go to the people that supply liquidity.

And anyone can be a liquidity provider.  You, me, or your grandma.  Providers basically deposit money into Uniswap to facilitate trades. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers, rather than going to Uniswap or its creators.

So an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice is our liquidity provider and she comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob is our trader, and he comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.

That's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. 

The returns on a pool like this are pretty good (about 20%-30% per year), but obviously there are some unique risks and the ROI is not constant. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels. There is also risk with the smart contract security itself, though Uniswap is pretty battle tested by this point.

The entire crypto market cap only just crossed $1 trillion recently, and that only happened while we’re in this bull cycle.

So nope, 15k not happening this year, More realistic ATH would be 2.5k, or 5k at most.

I do hope I’m wrong though.. If we get sharding and EIP1559 done by this year as promised. I could see ETH hitting $3.5k year end.. Already posted it somewhere else so I am just copy pasting myself:

not too farfetched (referring to 1 ETH =10k USD). It's like the 100k predictions mid 2020 before/shortly after halving. And now look at BTC, 100k price prediction not too far away. During last peak BTC/ETH ratio was something like 0.12 - 0.15 I had read a few days ago.

Depending on what you compare with each other you may also find 0.09 as peak ratio. 100k * 0.09 = 9k

So the rise of ETH is pretty much dependant of BTC's growth in my opinion. This may change this bull run, idk (personally I don't believe it)

Btw basis for the 100k+ prediction most of the time is the comparison with previous bull runs after a halving, see [here](https://twitter.com/ecoinometrics/status/1347573958401421312/photo/1) EOS","SOS British YouTuber with the following of over 22 million tweeted Ethereum!.

But when BTC goes sideways, alts can steal the spotlight and catch up/gain against BTC.. Keep in mind that the 2017/2018 ETH ATH happened about a month after BTC hit its ATH.. Whoever has a lot more trading volume will affect other coins. Generally bitcoin has the most. EOS"

It made me some good coin this month. ;) EOS","SOS We'll isn't that just unfortunate.. Lol, even after centralization they don't have control over it.

Some traders are girls, right? EOS","SOS Oh no, it went down. It’s actually fucking ridiculous how accurate this is when he gets to the third level. That’s exactly how it goes.

Then social media came and it changed how the human race interacts with each other, we can communicate across the globe seemlessly.

ETH and crypto is web 3.0, it's the evolution of the internet, and social media. It is taking both of them then adding on top of it a financial system that everyone can participate in with zero restrictions and everyone shares equal power.

Buying ETH is buying a percentage of the next iteration of the internet. Buying into crypto is buying a percentage of the next evolutionary state of money..

Generally the trouble with leaving your coins on an exchange or in a custodial app is that they have of the private keys that control your coins (in your case Eth).

EOS,"SOS Eth question: can you explain the difference between eth and eth classic? Why such a difference in price?. There was a major app called the DAO on Ethereum way back in the day.  There was MASSIVE amounts of ETH in it and then a smart contract bug was exploited and a hacker stole just insane amounts of ETH, enough to kinda cripple the network and overall supply.

The large majority of users, miners, and devs decided that the chain should be rolled back to before the hack.  However, a minority believed that the hack should stay intact and that it should not be rolled back as that sets a bad precedent.  The network forked into two chains, with the majority keeping ETH and the minority getting ETC.

Regardless of where you stand on the ideological bit of all this, ETC has basically flat lined in the last 5 years.  It often goes a couple minutes without a single transaction and it has been 51% attacked numerous times in the last year, making places like Coinbase sometimes require over a week of confirmations before they'll accept your deposit.  

The whole thing is a good reminder that blockchains are not completely immutable.  Even Bitcoin had a major rollback in it's younger days.  They are only immutable if the majority believe they should be immutable - and there clearly is a breaking point for a lot of people on this..

This may mean that depending on the performance in the test phase, the launch date on the mainnet could be delayed.

On the other hand, if this scalability proposal is launched successfully, zkSync would mean a relief in terms of network congestion, since the basic operation of a rollup is to “roll” multiple transactions into a single transaction. Matter Labs promises to increase transaction processing per second. It would go from the 15 TPS that are currently processed in Ethereum to more than 20,000.

That talk is more than necessary, considering hackers stole more than $100 million from DeFi projects in 2020, accounting for 50% of all hacks this year, according to a CipherTrace report.

Some point out that the occurrences were merely exploits that shined a light on the vulnerabilities of the respective smart contracts. The thieves didn’t really break into anything, they just happened to casually walk through the unlocked back door. By this logic, since the hackers exploited flaws without actually hacking in the traditional sense, the act of exploiting is ethically more justifiable.

28/5/2021,"SOS Why Cardano is better than Ethereum. Take it to Cardano then lol. Why Cardano has no future:

 - **They have no ecosystem**. Binance's SmartChain thought they could do this too. After all, they just needed some ETH code, to throw around some money and presto. Nope. This takes years (even after implementation) and organic knowledge working through the many problems that arise. That's why the SmartChain has become such a disaster with missing tokens, delays, and hacks that they've gone full 1984 and integrated a blockchain police force on-chain by partnering with California-based CipherTrace. It's a centralized disaster.

 - **They have no developer interest**. Go look at the Cardano projects on GitHub. Whaddya see? A ghost town. Now go look at Ethereum. Endless. Ethereum has 250,000 global developers. An army basically. And you think all developers are equal? They're not. Ethereum has the rockstars of that world. What's even more interesting is that most major developers of other projects seemingly all worked on Ethereum at one point. 

 - **Coding language keeps people away**. Cardano's coding language is a functional language called Haskell. Few use this or can be bothered to learn it. It's difficult and time consuming. This isn't a benefit to the open source world of decentralized blockchains. You want as many global developers as possible. Solidity, which is Ethereum's language, is Java based. That's like speaking english in the western world. And we have yet to see how Cardano can withstand huge volume and settlement. Lot's of blockchains think they can scale no problem, and theoretically have the throughput, but the real world is a much different.

 - **Competition moving at a much faster pace.** Cardano's snail-pace won't work in this ever-changing hyper-fast space where competition copies everything, has piles of money, and ingenuity is only as good as its speed. Composability makes this even harder to keep up with. And when regulation comes (and it will), peer reviewed white papers won't defeat it. 

Cardano's ADA is not a shitcoin, it's actually a well put together project, even if it's helmed by Charles Hoskinson, an ex-CIA analyst who would need 72 hours in a day to accomplish all the unrelated things he babbles about. Ada Lovelace would be proud, but Cardano is no Ethereum virtual runtime machine. The comparison isn't fair. Not even the staking mechanisms, by which Ethereum put's Cardano's amateur solution (and all other blockchains for that matter) to shame. This is the NFL vs a High School state champion. Cardano is another in a long line of braggadocio ETH killers. I should imagine after they step back, it'll make way for ICP (internet computer) to try and take a swing. Every year about this time we have a new challenger..

EOS,"SOS Traditional finance and crypto are often viewed as competing ecosystems, which should not be the case. Crypto is an advanced version of todayâ€™s markets, with the main distinguishing factor being a decentralized architecture. Some exchanges are combining the best of both worlds.. Nexo is the king at this I think. Their UI is amazing and reminds me of a challenger bank (cash app, current, chime) yet they pay about 10x the interest. 

Nexo is a model for all crypto companies IMO. I think if they can get their marketing more focused on non-crypto people, they'll be a unicorn, seriously. I have USDT, ETH and BTC earning 5% (or more) in such a simple manner.. This could be the case. Seems some of the financial firms are integrating crypto into their back room operations.. In my opinion, the only way crypto is truly going to succeed is if enough bridges are built between the legacy financial system and the new crypto defi world.

True adoption requires true institutional investment at a massive scale, and institutional investors aren’t going to jump ship and go all in on crypto. They will have to take it slowly, with measured steps, because that’s generally how those large institutions operate.

I fully believe in the new crypto defi world, and how it will improve the global economy in profound ways.

Brother I hold 707 ETH. I started in 2017. I bought as high as 1400. Then it crashed more than 90%. I kept buying. I refused to sell at a loss. Everyone said what everyone said but I was confident in the vision of the developers. I kept doubling down and brought my average to 285. It is now 302 because I bought 7 coins at 2k each. 


If it goes down you accumulate more ETH. If it goes up you hold. ETH is not going to stay low forever. Do you know why? Greed. Every cycle more people like you join in and buy coins at a higher price. That whole FOMO phase drives the price up. If you invest for the long term the cycle will keep on repeating and amplifying every time more.


At the end of the day it s your money. Hopefully you didn't risk money you need. If you invest money you can afford to lose you will never be forced to sell. 


A lot of newbs will tell you to sell but then I'd like to see how much they hold. Probably less than a coin anyway.. Here's what I did... bought a Ledger Nano, transferred what I own on to it.  Stuck it in the bottom drawer of my dresser and forgot about it.  I take it out from time to time to add during dips.  
It took away alot of the emotions because now I know that if I want to sell, I need to have that wallet with me.  I'm not usually just sitting around the house checking the price anymore so if it the price gets low and I have some cash, I buy a little more. I can buy at anytime, anywhere, but I need my wallet to sell.  Also helps that I'm lazy and it seems like to much work to sell.

>Ethereum’s Triple Halving has its roots in the reduction in supply, Following a successful upgrade to EIP 1559, a drop in sell pressure is expected. Analysts believe that  a 30% reduction of circulating Ether could take place, which is about half of the effect of a single Bitcoin halving. Meanwhile, the transition to PoS might result in a supply shock equivalent to two halvings.. Posts like this are what I live for. What does “Triple Halving” mean? 

Currently everyday miners in proof of work unload almost $12 mil of ETH to the market a day to cover their costs to mine.  That’s $12 mil of sell pressure everyday on ETH. 

“Post-merge, $ETH sell pressure will drop 90%. For $BTC sell pressure to reduce this much, it takes 3 halving events. “

EOS,"SOS Hello Everyone, any technical analysis recommendations for beginners!. NONE! The market behaviour is noise it is all random. All data can show is what happened. It can't say what *will* happen. Data can show you that, on average, a certain coin can get you x% ROI. But that can all change at any time. NO ONE KNOWS. This is why *experts, economists* (not half drunk youtubers from mama's basement) often can't agree whether we are in a bear or bull market for a long time. Familiarize yourself with the work of Daniel Khaneman to learn about numerous biases and fallacies we hold in our brain. 

The TA are, like all humans, a pattern seekers. That is looking for faces in the clouds. Just ignore them. It's all a hindsight bias. You following them is confirmation bias.

Crypto is still risky business. Set a goal, like you wanna buy a PC, a car, a house... Invest only what you can afford to loose. In fact, the moment you purchase the coin consider that a loss. Don't look at the charts they are meaningless. Check the price once a year. If the price hit the target - sell. Otherwise don't. You've already lost it, remember? A smart thing to do is to look into a DCA investment strategy. But beware, until you sell it is a loss. Invest only extra money. There is no shortcut. 

Don't read how crypto is good. If you are here, you already know this. Read how it is bad and how it might fuck us. That will help with some myopia and biases. But whatever you do, stay clear of TA.

Taxes: I use fiat to purchase USDC as my funding method and coinbase guarantees a 1:1 ratio the US dollar so there’s no Capital gains tax just for purchasing USDC or receiving crypto as “cash back”. 

Card rewards are not considered taxable by the IRS, they are considered a discount on goods and services. They are not treated as income like staking rewards or interest…unless…

…you sell your rewards. Then you incur Capital gains tax and since you received the Capital asset as an award (now the IRS doesn’t consider it non-taxable anymore), your cost basis is the fair market value at the time you received the rewards.. So in the USA, cash back is considered like a discount, or coupon, and therefore is not taxed… crypto cash back? I don’t know how that’ll be handled.

That’s scary.
Just read this part: “Some of the biggest validators staking through the AWS ASN are private (likely to be institutional finance), and Binance – both with in excess of 6,000,000 actively staked SOL (around $1bn in value).

Alongside the AWS are the Hetzner online data servers which are linked to the Hetzner Falkenstein project. With 68,459,414 SOL actively staked this ASN represents 17.94% of actively staked SOL.

Together, the two data centres account for more than 55% of the actively staked SOL on the network.”

“Solana’s protocol guarantees that transactions are processed, as long as 67% of the total stake is active,” he explained.

“If some nodes control more than 33% of stake and they, or the servers on which they are hosted, go offline, the Solana network would halt, until some of them go online again to reach the 67% threshold.”

Therefore if the Amazon-02 server goes offline – for maintenance or as the result of a cyber attack – the Solana network will be unable to process transactions until it’s able to migrate validators, and the network will fail.”

[Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_qtz593).. > bears can be embolden and take ETH lower towards $4K

We like to anthropomorphise phenomenon (eg ""nature abhors a vacuum""), but what bugs me about anthropomorphising TA - and I think contributes in some way to turning people off about it (which is actually fine with me) - is that what drives TA is, after all, collective human behavior underneath. Mostly.

Bears aren't ""emboldened"". That's anthropomorphing a line on a chart. The bears - the actual people - are *afraid*. Of the economy, of inflation, of regulation, etc. They are afraid of getting rekt, or at least being locked into not being able to take profit for a while if they don't do it now.

I've been doing TA since shortly after the dotcom crash. Sure it has it's own vernacular like anything else. But you can still use the jargon, without going so heavy on the anthropomorphing. Personally, I try to go out of my way to not do that, and instead select verbs and adjectives that explain the underlying hopes, fears, and greed of *hordes of people*, as it applies to price action.

(Also, tangentially, while not a bad analysis, I disagree with it. But I don't have the time nor the motivation you did to go into why. So, overall it's a worthwhile post that had effort put into it, and for that I upvoted!). Looks like there’s plenty of local support at 4,500 atm, if we can break and hold 5K for a bit, we can turn that into support EOS"

Therefore, the use case for using crypto for payment should be thrown out the window and we should be thinking of much much newer and different use cases to be applied..

For whatever reason, Reddit does not enable registration on mobile.  We unfortunately have no control over this as mods or as the community :(  So there's two ways of going about it: (1) use a desktop computer to register or (2) you can download a mobile browser that allows you to display webpages in desktop mode - Kiwi Browser is one that people have used and had success with.

Once registered, though, you can participate using your mobile like normal.  

Regarding xDai, your address on xDai is the same as it is on Ethereum.  If you need to add xdai as a network in your metamask, you can do so through a click of a button on our site:

[https://donut-dashboard.com/#/track](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/track) 

You can also add donut tokens to the Metamask asset list on that page as well.  When the monthly distribution comes around, your donuts will just appear in your wallet on xdai.  There will be no claiming process going forward.

[Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_s45eow).. The National Study of Millionaires by the Dave Ramsey Group showed that 79% of millionaires did not receive any inheritance at all from their parents or other family members. Eight out of ten millionaires invested in their company’s 401(k) plan. In fact, they worked, saved and invested for an average of 28 years before hitting the million-dollar mark, and most of them reached that milestone at age 49. 

When it comes to education it’s the degree itself that matters, not where the degree comes from.  Almost two-thirds of millionaires (62%) graduated from public state schools, while only 8% went to a prestigious private school. The top five careers for millionaires include engineer, accountant, teacher, management and attorney. Nearly half (47%) of millionaires came from homes where neither parent graduated from college or trade school.

 - Regulate stablecoins. 83% of all the Ethereum Network's volume is stablecoins. This means counterfeit versions of inflationary fiat collateralize the entire protocol

 - Have the president pick up the phone and call centralized exchange CEO's. Since CEX's run the majority of nodes, this means that after the merge, they'll run the majority of all Ethereum's network security

These platforms will be invaluable, competing with corporations and winning against giants who aren't accustomed to actual competition. People who get the administrative tokens allowing them to manage such platforms will have a clear step up over their finances. 

It is starting with decentralized storage and decentralized computing. But what's next?

That said, I'm getting to the same conclusion as yours: focus on the fundamentals. That's what actually counts long term for any token anyway. If it doesn't provide any value or business to people, it's most probably going to be a fad. Though, it' s just that value can vastly vary from person to person.

Where will ETH be 2 years from now?. [Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_uw08c9).. I agree with your general sentiment of being bullish on ETH.  However, I want to point out a few points you wrote, that a person new to crypto may be misled by.

1. Cherrypicking a specific price point in time to prove a point is not helpful.  You mention 2 years ago in May -- what about 1 year ago? 6 months ago?  Volatility is a defining attribute of cryptocurrencies and cherrypicking data to support pre-conceived notions is bad emotion management.
2. You compound on this error by glibly glossing, ""if we assume the same...trend"".  This is the worst advice or  mentality possible for investing in crypto.
3. You suggest that because a marketcap is high, it is ""harder to grow"".  Firstly, marketcap is a financial concept that makes more sense in traditional markets and businesses, where valuations are backed by capital or proven earnings, rather than the crypto market.  Second, you neglect to mention a crucial counterbalance to faster growth -- the risk profile along with that growth.
4. ""You will always win in this market if your timeframe is long.""  Keynes famously said that ""Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""  Your statement is especially flabbergasting in light of the recent Terra/Luna crash-to-zero.   There is risk to all aspects of investing, including hodling.  Separate sound decisionmaking from emotional attachment to a certain number of ETH, or the exact value of your entry basis.

May you survive multiple cycles and return in a few years to pass on this advice to the next generation.. Another 10X (to $20k) is certainly possible, given a long time frame.

Sadly, decentraland isn't an exception and misunderstands it much, as it is yet again a rehashing of the concept of scarce land, in a universe where there is no need for such scarcity.

It's a bit as if Ethereum was created with a concept of scarce blockchain visibility, as in every time you access the blockchain, you'd have to literally pay for it. It's not an actual scarcity, as blockchain data needs to be visible by as many people as possible to guarantee it isn't easily manipulated, so it would be an artificial scarcity.

But even if, let's assume, visibility scarcity wasn't creating problems through other means, the simple fact of adding that visibility scarcity when none is needed would have been a huge restraint to network development and attractiveness..

Conflicts of interest aside, I couldn't actually find a proper source for the actual survey and its methodology. The person asked just dodged the question about how they selected the 1000 people they asked.  

That said, apparently 900 of those 1000 had bought crypto in the prior 6 months so please consider how much value this particular survey has, lol.  

edit: Even fucking coinbase isn't trying to misrepresent what this is as much, shame on you OP.. I'm done with Ethereum and the high gas fees, especially since the merge situation is a mess and POS will be centralized. Gas fees on Ethereum won't be solved until sharding is introduced, and who knows exactly when that will happen. A better solution for scaling Ethereum is sidechains like Polygon and the internet computer. Polygon uses wrapped Ethereum and runs just like Ethereum with low gas fees and fast transactions. ICP is working to integrate Ethereum directly in its blockchain, so it won't be wrapped or a token.

It's just the same as usual: a bit more volatile than BTC, be it in downward or upward trends. There's no difference with previous cycles, up until now. 

>Since the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is due for its launch, it is quite expected for Ethereum to upsurge in value, but it currently seems like investors are hardly curious about it anymore. 

Not needed anyway. The reduction in ETH issuance is more than enough. 

>Besides this, the delay in the transition is also one of the many reasons which might eventually lead ETH 2.0 to take the same road that was taken by LUNA 2.0.

How is it related in any way?

>The value of the ETH tokens has been consistently declining over the past several weeks.

Like the whole market. Why specifically claiming it's just ETH?

>Recently, crypto experts reported that Ethereum 2.0 might not be a hit and instead will turn out to be just the opposite of what everyone is expecting.

Source?

>But unfortunately, Ethereum’s upgrade has failed to cause such a buzz in the market and is experiencing massive sell-offs by its investors.

The upgrade isn't there yet.

>It is quite evident that investors are spooked by the continuous blows from the market, one after the other.

They're spooked by the market in general, not just ETH.

>According to experts, the Ethereum Merge upgrade is like a double-edged sword.

Source? According to ""experts"", this isn't an article worth of even being toilet paper, as it's not even having the merit of being on paper.

>Ether might turn into another one of those crypto nightmares and might shortly follow LUNA 2.0

How is it even related to Luna in any way?

>investor sentiments are key to the project’s success

Source? Argument? Anything? No, really, just an unbacked claim?

>only time will tell how they will react to the new launch.

Since it's what investors asked for at the beginning of the project, anyone can pretty easily tell. Except maybe that ""author"".. ""According to experts, the Ethereum Merge upgrade is like a double-edged sword.""

[Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_vj0g8q).. Many people claim to know where things are going but no one does. This is a new finance world and the Fed and govs are at much at sea as regular investors. No one has a crystal ball.

The only important bit is not to invest what you won't miss, advice seen and ignored here daily.. No one knows where the market might go. 

IMO Ethereum is the safest, most advanced, dominant L1. Ethereum foundation are working hard and just keep building, yes of course other L1s build but Ethereum has more adaption. 

No one likes the high fees, however this is needed to secure the blockchain, hopefully in the future they go down.

If what you mean by ""signed for another coin"" is that you've given your signed authorization that a given smart contract can do whatever it wants with a specific ERC-20 token, then it will be able to do whatever it wants with any such tokens you own. It doesn't impact any other ERC-20 tokens or ETH.

But, there are tokens out there which have malicious or unexpected (at least by users) behaviors and which aren't implementing ERC-20 interface as they should. This is the kind of tokens you should never interact with. Even worse would be giving signed authorization to a smart contract to use the token functions as they see fit, as such token functions could very well be spending your ETH.. Compromise by signing a smart contract should only affect the token/ coins for which you granted permission.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ethtrader) if you have any questions or concerns.*. tldr; Tl;dr: Ethereum is anticipated to move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) on or around September 15, 2022 making it more secure, less energy-intensive, and better for implementing new scaling solutions. Rest assured, your assets will be safe and secure during this period and no action is required to upgrade on your part. The following piece outlines what you can expect from Coinbase ahead of The Merge. By Armin Rezaiean-Asel, Product Manager at Coinbase On August 10, 2022 Ethereum completed the Goerli public testnet merge — its final trial before making the migration from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS)* on mainnet (also known as the Merge). Ethereum is now anticipated to complete the Merge on or around September 15, 2022 (TTD 58750000000000000000000). Six years in the making, this milestone will reduce energy consumption for the Ethereum network by a projected 99.95% compared to PoW. With the rise of DeFi and NFTs, the Ethereum network has endured traffic bottlenecks and unpredictable spikes in transaction (gas) fees. Although PoS on its own does not lower transaction fees, it does set Ethereum up to continue delivering on its scalability roadmap. At Coinbase, we view this event as a major step toward scaling adoption of the cryptoeconomy and will support it in a variety of ways that align with our mission to increase economic freedom in the world. What does the Merge mean for Coinbase users? During the Merge, Coinbase will briefly pause new Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals as a precautionary measure. Although the Merge is expected to be seamless from a user perspective, this downtime allows us to ensure that the transition has been successfully reflected by our systems. We do not expect any other networks or currencies to be impacted and expect no impact to trading for ETH and ERC-20 tokens across our centralized trading products. You will be informed via Twitter and the status page when ETH and ERC-20 tokens are available for deposits and withdrawals. It’s important to always be on high alert for scams, but especially leading up to the Merge. We recommend you don’t send your ETH to anyone in an attempt to “upgrade to ETH2” as there is no ETH2 token. Your assets will be safe and secure during this period and no action is required to upgrade on your part. Once the Merge is complete, you can find your staked ETH (ETH2) balance under your Ethereum (ETH) wallet on the platform. Your staked ETH will be listed separately from any unstaked ETH or dapp wallet ETH balance you might be holding. As a reminder, ETH2 is the ticker Coinbase set ahead of the Merge to represent staked ETH and will no longer be used after the Merge — there is no ETH2 token. Staked ETH (ETH2) balances won’t be unlocked at the time of the Merge or be available to trade or transfer until the Ethereum protocol upgrade completes. The upgrade is anticipated to be completed by early 2023. For Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Exchange customers: Coinbase Prime users with ETH and ERC-20 balances may experience temporary delays in custody withdrawal availability. We recommend initiating any withdrawals or deposits prior to this date, or after the Merge completes. We’ll send specific institutional customer communications before the transition to give our customers specific guidance on timing and SLAs during this time. For Coinbase Cloud customers: Customers running their staking or node infrastructure through Coinbase Cloud should expect to experience a routine upgrade with approximately 10 minutes of downtime in advance of the Merge. Customer infrastructure should experience little to no downtime when the Merge block is passed, and changes will be backwards compatible. Our Customer Success team will reach out to inform you of upgrade timelines and if any other actions are required to prepare you for the Merge. For Coinbase Wallet users: Coinbase Wallet users with ETH and ERC-20 balances, as well as NFTs or DeFi positions on the Ethereum network, should experience minimal to no impact. Assuming a successful transition, the network will remain operational, and users can continue to transact with their self-custodied crypto on the Ethereum mainnet once the transition is complete. As always, network fees will be set by the network based on demand, and as a reminder, Coinbase neither sets nor collects those fees. For Coinbase Commerce customers: During the merge time, we will be temporarily pausing the ability to process new payments as a precautionary measure to ensure that funds are protected. In-process payments will also be delayed. Once the merge is complete, payment processing will be re-enabled. There is no action required by users and in-process payments will be confirmed at this time. We aim to support the Merge with the least amount of friction possible for our users — without compromising on security. We’ll continue to provide updates on our Twitter and Statuspage as more information becomes available. As a reminder, the Merge is the culmination of years of work by the Ethereum Foundation, independent researchers, client teams, infrastructure providers like Coinbase Cloud, and many others. At Coinbase, our role is to protect users’ assets and help ensure a seamless transition across Coinbase products. For Ethereum network specific information, you can follow the Ethereum Foundation Blog as well as the Ethereum network on Twitter. *Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are the two main consensus mechanisms used to verify new blocks and add them to the blockchain. First pioneered by Bitcoin, PoW consensus mechanisms use mining to achieve these goals. On the other hand, popular PoS blockchains such as Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and Solana utilize staking to achieve similar goals. The Ethereum Merge is Coming: Here’s what you need to know was originally published in The Coinbase Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.

Are you talking about ETH somehow being ruled a security?  Or OFAC trying to censor the protocol level via validators in an attempt to freeze scammer assets?  Two different issues.

I'd expect Coinbase to fall in line if OFAC gives an order - they are a public US company.   But we're a long ways from that yet.  So far, this was just a warning shot to illicit some fear, and the Tornado order may not even hold up in court.  (It's extremely doubtful this would even come close to accomplishing what OFAC would want, anyways - there's plenty of non-US validators, it's gonna get picked up eventually)

A lot of these same issues apply to any chain.  CT is concern trolling ETH specifically on the OFAC stuff due to the Tornado situation coming from Ethereum, but it applies to the entirety of crypto.  Mining pools on any chain could easily start censoring and more centralized blockchains will instantly fold on this.

XRP fanbase meanwhile is really trying to push ETH is a security FUD, because we're apparently at a point where it would really help their own SEC case.  We have no indication that this is being pursued right now, it's just wishful thinking from the XRP army..  EOS"

EOS","SOS What does Ethereumâ€™s move to PoS mean for Layer 2 solutions? Hereâ€™s all you need to know:. [Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_wwajus).. Will the APY reach 8% after the merge or go up slowly?. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

That's because the Eth transition to PoS did not promise a 100% reduction in transaction fees nor does it promises a faster transaction time. So, basically, we'll have the L2 thriving still. There could even be more springing up in the coming months to years.

On the other hand, I think the success of Eth 2.0 will rub off on ERC20 tokens big time. I'm expecting some major move on web3 best projects like LINK, DIA, etc over the next few weeks after the transition. 

Well, we can only speculate rn, let's see how it all goes in the next few weeks to months. EOS","SOS Ethereum Merge in trouble? Developers find bugs ahead of the planned update. [Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_wwifnu).. > Despite the issues, the developers were able to provide a fix after a day. Go Ethereum released a hotfix to patch the bug.

Clickbait title. Not surprised.. Bugs in undeployed code? Doomed! Doomed, I tell you! EOS","SOS ETH2 to cbETH ?. [Tip this post](https://www.donut.finance/tip/?contentId=t3_wwrij1).. They are basically moving to a system similar to their competitors, called ""liquid staking"".  When you stake ETH, you can now receive cbETH.  This is actually an ERC-20 token that you can withdraw from Coinbase and hold in your own wallet on main net Ethereum.  Some reasons you might want to do this:

* You are now no longer ""locked-in"" to your stake.  If you sell this token on say, Uniswap, you are effectively selling your Coinbase staking position to someone else.  You will almost certainly not get your full ETH back, but it is an emergency escape hatch.  (probably like 95% to 97%, judging from other liquid staking tokens)
* You will be able to use your cbETH in some DeFi apps, for further gains.  (For example, liquidity pools)
* You hold the keys to where your assets are kept.  (though you are still highly dependent upon Coinbase here)

Over time, the value of cbETH will slowly increase to reflect your staking rewards.  You will also be able to ""unwrap"" it back to ETH for free on Coinbase, once withdrawals are enabled.  This is very similar to the Rocketpool model (rETH).  So out of the gate, 1 ETH = 1 cbETH.  After a year, 1 ETH = 1.05 cbETH (assuming \~5% staking return).

It appears this is entirely opt-in, so you can still stay with the locked ETH2 that you currently have.

One gotcha to keep an eye on - switching from ETH2 to cbETH is very likely a taxable event in the US, as you just sold your ETH and bought a new token.  So it would trigger capital gains or losses.   There's no official guidance from the IRS on this, so how you report this is kind of up to you.  It's debatable that going from ETH to ETH2 was itself a taxable event.

Depending on where you live, trading to cbEth is likely to be taxable. EOS","SOS Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE continues to reverse, ready for a swift move to $0.075?.

I had always heard that you can't switch between FIFO & LIFO, but I decided to google a bit when reading your post.  I've found a couple people saying that you actually can switch year-to-year, and the strict rule only applies to professional trading firms.

You still have to stay consistent within a year and once a unit is sold, it is off the books.  (can't turn around and sell that same unit again in later years, just because you changed the accounting strategy).

Here's one such post with this opinion:

[https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/145632/when-is-it-ok-to-switch-from-a-fifo-cost-basis-to-lifo](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/145632/when-is-it-ok-to-switch-from-a-fifo-cost-basis-to-lifo)

Probably need a tax advisor/attorney to get a more authoritative opinion, but that was news to me that this might even be an option.

To your original question - maybe it's a sign from the universe that you need to get in now before the bear market ends.  Or maybe it's the universe deciding that the best way to make your life miserable is to fat-finger a buy and then tank the market further.
